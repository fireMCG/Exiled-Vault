She makes the rules up as she goes.  
It was never going to be fair.

## Effect
The Maven casts Up the Stakes, summoning 1 to 3 additional Atlas Bosses
when Witnessing Map Bosses
The number of additional Bosses summoned is higher if there
are fewer monsters remaining in the Map
Modifiers to the Final Map Boss in each Map also apply to these summoned Bosses
