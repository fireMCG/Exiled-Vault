## Duelist - PoE1 Dialogue
#### Duelist1
Not the most pleasant of arenas, but it'll have to do, for now.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist1.ogg]]

#### Duelist2
Even the dead rise to challenge me here.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist2.ogg]]

#### Duelist3
It's to be a cage fight then. I can live with that.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist3.ogg]]

#### Duelist4
Skill beats size, every time.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist4.ogg]]

#### Duelist5
We stand at death's door. Ladies first, fair Merveil.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist5.ogg]]

#### Duelist6
I almost feel sorry for these doomed sea dogs.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist6.ogg]]

#### Duelist7
It's not everyday that I get to duel with a legend. Thank you, Fairgraves.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist7.ogg]]

#### Duelist8
Well fought, Oak. A shame we have only the trees for audience.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist8.ogg]]

#### Duelist9
A pity your mind wasn't as swift as your blades, bridge rat.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist9.ogg]]

#### Duelist10
It's hard to cast a spell with a blade in your throat, isn't it, witch?
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist10.ogg]]

#### Duelist11
A place of soiled dreams. I'll have to tread carefully here.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist11.ogg]]

#### Duelist12
This can't be good.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist12.ogg]]

#### Duelist13
A duel like no other. I think I'm starting to like this Wraeclast.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist13.ogg]]

#### Duelist14
I favour a fair fight. I doubt I'll get one in this place.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist14.ogg]]

#### Duelist15
It's seems there's glory in the old empire yet.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist15.ogg]]

#### Duelist16
Piety's home away from home. Let's see if the sick witch is in.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist16.ogg]]

#### Duelist17
Dying in battle... the only honourable thing you've ever done, Gravicius.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist17.ogg]]

#### Duelist18
Sorry, beautiful, but someone had to put a stop to all this ugliness.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist18.ogg]]

#### Duelist19
Climb the tower, kill the mad king. Just like the stories my mum used to read to me.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist19.ogg]]

#### Duelist20
A just death to address an unjust exile. I think we're even now, High Templar.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist20.ogg]]

#### Duelist21
A stroll along a picturesque canal. Some time in the mountains. What could be more relaxing?
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist21.ogg]]

#### Duelist22
Now this is... grim.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist22.ogg]]

#### Duelist23
It seemed to me, Voll, that I just did you a favour.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist23.ogg]]

#### Duelist24
There's nothing like making a ground-shaking entrance.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist24.ogg]]

#### Duelist25
Actually, I'm really not sure I like the sound of that.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist25.ogg]]

#### Duelist26
Always happy to help a damsel in distress.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist26.ogg]]

#### Duelist27
Buried under tons of rock? Not a good way to end this tale of mine.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist27.ogg]]

#### Duelist28
Damn me, it's good to be back in the arena!
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist28.ogg]]

#### Duelist29
Your glory will be remembered in song forever, Daresso. I promise you that.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist29.ogg]]

#### Duelist30
I once heard a Karui mention their 'island of the dead'. Perhaps this is it.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist30.ogg]]

#### Duelist31
Just be happy that you got a warrior's death, Kaom.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist31.ogg]]

#### Duelist32
I'm inside it... the Beast itself!
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist32.ogg]]

#### Duelist33
This thing gets more twisted with every step I take.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist33.ogg]]

#### Duelist34
Take comfort, Maligaro. An artist's work is always worth more when he's dead.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist34.ogg]]

#### Duelist35
Flattery will get you nowhere with me, m'lady.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist35.ogg]]

#### Duelist36
I didn't catch a word of what you said, Doedre. That's probably a good thing.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist36.ogg]]

#### Duelist37
Oh, well, far be it from me to deny a lady's final wish.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist37.ogg]]

#### Duelist38
It's a strange feeling, when the fighting is done. I've won. The nightmare is ended.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist38.ogg]]

#### Duelist39
I think this'll come in handy at some point.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist39.ogg]]

#### Duelist41
Need to be a little more deft to use this.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist41.ogg]]

#### Duelist43
Ah... that hit the spot.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist43.ogg]]

#### Duelist45
Can't quite get my head around this one.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist45.ogg]]

#### Duelist47
I believe in travelling light.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist47.ogg]]

#### Duelist49
A worthy opponent!
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist49.ogg]]

#### Duelist51
You die rather well!
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist51.ogg]]

#### Duelist53
Didn't even break a sweat!
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist53.ogg]]

#### Duelist55
Practice makes perfect!
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist55.ogg]]

#### Duelist57
I do love the stink of victory!
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist57.ogg]]

#### Duelist59
My spirit is spent.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist59.ogg]]

#### Duelist61
I can't do this just yet.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist61.ogg]]

#### Duelist63
I'll need to build up some muscle for this one.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist63.ogg]]

#### Duelist65
There'll be time for that soon enough.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist65.ogg]]

#### Duelist67
It's nice not to be dead, yet.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist67.ogg]]

#### Duelist68
It seems this new arena suits me.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist68.ogg]]

#### Duelist69
Couldn't ask for a better training ground than Wraeclast.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist69.ogg]]

#### Duelist70
My fans in Oriath will barely recognise me.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist70.ogg]]

#### Duelist71
I'm starting to think there's more to life than prize or perish.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist71.ogg]]

#### Duelist72
I believe I could give the great Daresso a run for his money, now.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist72.ogg]]

#### Duelist73
I think it's time to shed the dream of home. It's a little tight around the collar.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist73.ogg]]

#### Duelist74
This is not exactly how I pictured my triumphant return to Oriath.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist74.ogg]]

#### Duelist75
It feels good to have an audience again!
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist75.ogg]]

#### Duelist76
Daring dark and dingy spaces, for 'science!'
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist76.ogg]]

#### Duelist77
Not my proudest trophy...
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist77.ogg]]

#### Duelist78
I see the ugliness of Oriath has finally reached the surface.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist78.ogg]]

#### Duelist79
I should think of something flashy to say to the judges that exiled me... before I kill them.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist79.ogg]]

#### Duelist80
Time to take my grievance right to the top!
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist80.ogg]]

#### Duelist81
This is new!
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist81.ogg]]

#### Duelist82
Ah, they saved me the trouble of burning this place down!
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist82.ogg]]

#### Duelist83
I wanted to raze the place... but this is just excessive.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist83.ogg]]

#### Duelist84
Whatever happened to a good old fashioned graveyard?
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist84.ogg]]

#### Duelist85
This feels like... power.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist85.ogg]]

#### Duelist86
Now seems a good time to question my life decisions.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist86.ogg]]

#### Duelist87
Is this what losing a fight feels like? Ugh...
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist87.ogg]]

#### Duelist88
I've never been one for history class...
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist88.ogg]]

#### Duelist89
Back to where it all began.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist89.ogg]]

#### Duelist90
Time for an encore!
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist90.ogg]]

#### Duelist91
Saving the fair maiden seems right up my alley.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist91.ogg]]

#### Duelist92
That was the Tukohama? Best not mention this to the Karui...
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist92.ogg]]

#### Duelist93
There's a lady in a tower, but this is no fairytale.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist93.ogg]]

#### Duelist94
They're gonna combine?!
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist94.ogg]]

#### Duelist95
Always a pleasure, m'lady.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist95.ogg]]

#### Duelist96
And now I stink of goat.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist96.ogg]]

#### Duelist97
I will never get this smell out of my clothes.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist97.ogg]]

#### Duelist98
Seems the Azmeri have lost their home to bandits!
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist98.ogg]]

#### Duelist99
Far be it from me to disbelieve a fair lady, but this sounds... fishy.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist99.ogg]]

#### Duelist100
I've never dueled a king before. First time for everything!
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist100.ogg]]

#### Duelist101
I'm sorry, Lady Nessa, but there was nothing I could do for you.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist101.ogg]]

#### Duelist102
Touching this makes me feel quite strange...
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist102.ogg]]

#### Duelist103
Where am I?
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist103.ogg]]

#### Duelist104
That's two for me, artist. But who's counting?
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist104.ogg]]

#### Duelist105
I wonder if this means Helena's available... ah, best leave that be.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist105.ogg]]

#### Duelist106
I was never one for eulogies. And I'm still not.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist106.ogg]]

#### Duelist107
This Arakaali sounds like my kind of woman!
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist107.ogg]]

#### Duelist108
There's no joy in slaying a mother. Just a hollow victory.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist108.ogg]]

#### Duelist109
Okay... so... she's a cat.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist109.ogg]]

#### Duelist110
This 'Goddess of Lust' better be worth it!
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist110.ogg]]

#### Duelist111
That's Arakaali?!
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist111.ogg]]

#### Duelist112
If that was the Goddess of Lust, then I'm considering an oath of celibacy.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist112.ogg]]

#### Duelist113
Ah, smells just like the Theopolis dueling pits.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist113.ogg]]

#### Duelist114
It's hard to look good when I'm always braving sewers...
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist114.ogg]]

#### Duelist115
After that... I need a bath.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist115.ogg]]

#### Duelist116
The things we do for love.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist116.ogg]]

#### Duelist117
Honourable deaths. My gift to you, gemlings.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist117.ogg]]

#### Duelist118
I've never been scared of mirrors. After all, I'm in them.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist118.ogg]]

#### Duelist119
The blood has washed away, but I will never forget what you became, Vinia.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist119.ogg]]

#### Duelist120
A shame. I would have enjoyed further sparring matches with those two.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist120.ogg]]

#### Duelist121
Well, that's one way to end a marriage.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist121.ogg]]

#### Duelist122
It's hard to be proud of this one. Your own daughter...
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist122.ogg]]

#### Duelist123
Oh, Trarthus, how I miss your opium dens!
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist123.ogg]]

#### Duelist124
Here I go again...
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist124.ogg]]

#### Duelist125
With luck, that was the last time I'll have to sully myself with those three.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist125.ogg]]

#### Duelist126
It's time to end this.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist126.ogg]]

#### Duelist127
I'm getting really tired of grudge matches!
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist127.ogg]]

#### Duelist128
I don't suppose there's time to convince Innocence to put on some clothes for this battle...
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist128.ogg]]

#### Duelist129
Now seems a good time to question my life decisions... again.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist129.ogg]]

#### Duelist130
Now this is how I pictured my triumphant return to Oriath!
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist130.ogg]]

#### Duelist131
Like stepping into a dream...
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist131.ogg]]

#### Duelist132
I'm sorry, Kirac. Your brother was mad.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist132.ogg]]

#### Duelist133
A pity, m'lady. I adored your wings.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist133.ogg]]

#### Duelist134
A man makes his own fate, Al.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist134.ogg]]

#### Duelist135
Warlord, what's the point of all this combat if there's no one around to see it?
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist135.ogg]]

#### Duelist136
I'm truly sorry. It had to be done.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist136.ogg]]

#### Duelist137
I wonder if this means Zana's available... ah, best leave that one alone.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist137.ogg]]

#### Duelist138
The domineering floating woman is a hatchling? Well, this is awkward.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist138.ogg]]

#### Duelist139
An audience of one is still an audience, I suppose.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist139.ogg]]

#### Duelist140
My lady bids you farewell, Exarch. This is her kingdom!
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist140.ogg]]

#### Duelist141
How did you like that victory, my lady?
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist141.ogg]]

#### Duelist142
You won't be eating any worlds today, fiend. Damn, I'm good!
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist142.ogg]]

#### Duelist143
Painful memories are the ones that teach us, Venarius. Remember that.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist143.ogg]]

#### Duelist144
I have a feeling I'll see Oriath again... one day.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Duelist144.ogg]]

#### Dom_Intro_Duelist.ogg
You were born to be swift and strong. What did you do with your gifts, Duelist? You squandered them on self-indulgence. Sin has led you here, your path inked in the blood of gratuitous murder. You have betrayed the Grand Arena. Now Wraeclast shall be your audience... and your foe.
![[Duelist - PoE1 - Dom_Intro_Duelist.ogg.ogg]]
