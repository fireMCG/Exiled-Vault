## Daresso Dialogue
#### Daresso1Intro
I am Daresso, the Sword King. It was here, in the pits of Theopolis that I made my name, killing rabid dogs and wild boars before I could even be considered a man. In this so glorious of arenas, I care nothing for your past, only your future... and for that, you will have to fight!

#### Daresso1Combat
People of the gutters, steel your bellies, for the slaughter is at hand!

#### Daresso1Complete
An adequate performance, challenger, if a little messy. Yet Barkhul and his stinking flock were simply an audition. Let us see how you fare in the Grand Arena of Theopolis!

#### Daresso2Intro
Welcome to the Grand Arena of Theopolis. It is here that I first laid eyes upon my true purpose, my lady Merveil. It is our inspiration that defines us. What do you fight for, Gladiator? Hundreds of warriors tried to lay claim to the same title as I, but I defeated them all. Victory goes not to the able, but to the ambitious.

#### Daresso2Combat
Die a death worthy of applause, Gladiator!

#### Daresso2Complete
A battle worthy of song! The way you fight reminds me of how it feels to be possessed with the ideal of victory. Is your passion enough to claim a crown? We shall see.

#### Daresso3Intro
A King of Swords is nothing if he cannot defend his crown.

#### DaressoDeath
Sing for me, Merveil. Sing of glory and love...
