For Tukohama!
![[Akoya - AncestralAkoyaForTukohamaRandom.ogg]]

#### AkoyaObjectsToPlayer
Why should we allow an outsider to participate in our sacred traditions? This has always been a place for Karui warriors to hone their mettle against the best that ever lived. This outsider cannot possibly stand against us!
![[Akoya - AkoyaObjectsToPlayer.ogg]]

#### AkoyaDoesFirstChallenge
Very well. I shall make the challenge myself. I will be the first to fight!
![[Akoya - AkoyaDoesFirstChallenge.ogg]]

#### AkoyaAfterPlayerWinsFirstFight
I am impressed. It seems you may be worthy to participate here after all. Next time, of course, I shall not go so easy on you.
![[Akoya - AkoyaAfterPlayerWinsFirstFight.ogg]]

#### AkoyaAfterPlayerLosesFirstFight
You have some skill, outsider. Perhaps you may be worthy to participate here after all. I withdraw my objection, on the assumption that you will train and improve.
![[Akoya - AkoyaAfterPlayerLosesFirstFight.ogg]]

#### AkoyaLikesPlayerIsChampion
Honour our ways, makanga! Win again, on pure strength!
![[Akoya - AkoyaLikesPlayerIsChampion.ogg]]

#### AkoyaNeutralPlayerIsChampion
Makanga or not, you must prove yourself!
![[Akoya - AkoyaNeutralPlayerIsChampion.ogg]]

#### AkoyaDislikesPlayerIsChampion
The title of makanga means nothing for one who cannot defend it!
![[Akoya - AkoyaDislikesPlayerIsChampion.ogg]]

#### AkoyaLikesPlayerLostLast
It is the duty of the weak to become stronger, outsider!
![[Akoya - AkoyaLikesPlayerLostLast.ogg]]

#### AkoyaNeutralPlayerLostLast
The strongest will win this battle!
![[Akoya - AkoyaNeutralPlayerLostLast.ogg]]

#### AkoyaDislikesPlayerLostLast
This is a waste of our time, and I say that knowing we have forever!
![[Akoya - AkoyaDislikesPlayerLostLast.ogg]]

#### AkoyaLikesPlayerNoRecord
I am eager to see whether this outsider has the strength needed!
![[Akoya - AkoyaLikesPlayerNoRecord.ogg]]

#### AkoyaNeutralPlayerNoRecord
I have no idea what to expect here...
![[Akoya - AkoyaNeutralPlayerNoRecord.ogg]]

#### AkoyaDislikesPlayerNoRecord
The old ways demand only the best warriors!

The oldest among us will show us the Way!

I'm eager to see how you snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, Kaom!

#### AkoyaCommentsOnKiloava
Show us how you earned the title, first Herald of War!
![[Akoya - AkoyaCommentsOnKiloava.ogg]]

#### AkoyaCommentsOnMaata
What is your grand strategy this time, Maata?
![[Akoya - AkoyaCommentsOnMaata.ogg]]

#### AkoyaCommentsOnTawhanuku
Have you foreseen the victor of this battle, Tawhanuku? How boring!
![[Akoya - AkoyaCommentsOnTawhanuku.ogg]]

#### AkoyaCommentsOnUtula
Utula, you will lose, because you do not honour the Way!
![[Akoya - AkoyaCommentsOnUtula.ogg]]

#### AkoyaCommentsOnAhuana
As you would say, Ahuana, have fun!
![[Akoya - AkoyaCommentsOnAhuana.ogg]]

#### AkoyaFightBeginsPlayerWonLast

I hope you've improved since last we fought!

Numbers mean nothing. Only strength matters!

Fighting outnumbered is a bold choice!

#### AkoyaFightBeginsPlayerLessItems
Did you even prepare for this battle?
![[Akoya - AkoyaFightBeginsPlayerLessItems.ogg]]

#### AkoyaFightBeginsPlayerMoreFieldItems
Your battlefield strategy won't matter if you're not strong enough to win!
![[Akoya - AkoyaFightBeginsPlayerMoreFieldItems.ogg]]

#### AkoyaFightBeginsPlayerLessFieldItems
Even if you're strong, you can't ignore the battlefield!
![[Akoya - AkoyaFightBeginsPlayerLessFieldItems.ogg]]

Let's rally!
![[Akoya - AkoyaTeamTotemDestroyed5.ogg]]

#### AkoyaTotemDestroyed1
Good move!
![[Akoya - AkoyaTotemDestroyed1.ogg]]

#### AkoyaTotemDestroyed3
Hah, got me!
![[Akoya - AkoyaTotemDestroyed3.ogg]]

Oops!
![[Akoya - AkoyaTotemDestroyed5.ogg]]

Keep fighting!
![[Akoya - AkoyaYourTeamTotemDestroyed1.ogg]]

You should have guarded your totems more carefully!

Continue the assault!

Not strong enough!

Not bad, outsider. Not bad at all.
![[Akoya - AkoyaCommentWhenDefeated1.ogg]]

#### AkoyaCommentsFromStandsOnMatch1
You have honoured our Way!
![[Akoya - AkoyaCommentsFromStandsOnMatch1.ogg]]

#### AkoyaCommentPurchaseItem1
Our equipment is forged solely for war.
![[Akoya - AkoyaCommentPurchaseItem1.ogg]]

#### AkoyaCommentPurchaseItem3
It will never fail you.
![[Akoya - AkoyaCommentPurchaseItem3.ogg]]

#### AkoyaCommentPurchaseFieldItem1
Strategy is a kind of strength.
![[Akoya - AkoyaCommentPurchaseFieldItem1.ogg]]

#### AkoyaCommentPurchaseFieldItem3
Bolster your strengths, guard your weaknesses.
![[Akoya - AkoyaCommentPurchaseFieldItem3.ogg]]

#### AkoyaCommentInspectRecruits1
The Tukohama Tribe's warriors cannot be matched.
![[Akoya - AkoyaCommentInspectRecruits1.ogg]]

#### AkoyaCommentInspectRecruits3
These are the best that ever lived.
![[Akoya - AkoyaCommentInspectRecruits3.ogg]]

#### AkoyaCommentInspectRecruits5
Each one has been tested and proven true.
![[Akoya - AkoyaCommentInspectRecruits5.ogg]]

#### AkoyaCommentRecruitRecruit1
You honour us with your choice.
![[Akoya - AkoyaCommentRecruitRecruit1.ogg]]

#### AkoyaCommentRecruitRecruit3
Now, you will most certainly win.
![[Akoya - AkoyaCommentRecruitRecruit3.ogg]]

#### Kaom's Defeat
It was good that you defeated Kaom in battle. Our Way is about true strength, not arrogant boasts. He needs to learn the difference.
![[Akoya - Kaom's Defeat.ogg]]

#### Kaom's Victory
Kaom is one of the best I have ever seen. I will give him that. Next time, however, I would prefer that you find a way to defeat him.
![[Akoya - Kaom's Victory.ogg]]

#### Utula's Defeat
Thank you for defeating Utula. Perhaps this may teach him some humility. I doubt it, but I still have hope.
![[Akoya - Utula's Defeat.ogg]]

#### Utula's Victory
If that battle had happened in life, Utula would be carving out your heart right now.
![[Akoya - Utula's Victory.ogg]]

#### Ahuana's Defeat
Your battle with Ahuana was engaging to watch. I think she might have gone a bit easy on you, but you did win, and that is all that matters.
![[Akoya - Ahuana's Defeat.ogg]]

#### Ahuana's Victory
Ahuana may speak kindly, but she is a true follower of the Way. You will need great strength to defeat her.
![[Akoya - Ahuana's Victory.ogg]]

#### Tawhanuku's Defeat
I hope Tawhanuku did not see her loss coming.
![[Akoya - Tawhanuku's Defeat.ogg]]

#### Tawhanuku's Victory
How shameful of her, to take a battle while already knowing the outcome. You must defeat Tawhanuku next time, outsider.
![[Akoya - Tawhanuku's Victory.ogg]]

#### Rakiata's Defeat
I am surprised that you managed to defeat Rakiata. Well done.
![[Akoya - Rakiata's Defeat.ogg]]

#### Rakiata's Victory
Rakiata has a fighting style all her own. It will take some time to adapt to it. Train hard for next time.
![[Akoya - Rakiata's Victory.ogg]]

#### Akoya's Defeat
Defeat stings, but I am pleased you have embraced our Way. You have my respect.
![[Akoya - Akoya's Defeat.ogg]]

#### Akoya's Victory
Victory must be earned. It is not so easily achieved.
![[Akoya - Akoya's Victory.ogg]]

#### Match Victory
You fight like no warrior I have ever seen. Perhaps we should invite more outsiders here, to bring us new knowledge.
![[Akoya - Match Victory.ogg]]

#### Match Loss
Clearly, the Karui styles of fighting are superior, but I see potential in you. Perhaps, with enough training, you will have something to teach us.
![[Akoya - Match Loss.ogg]]

#### AkoyaCommentOnPurchaseItemAhuana
Interesting choice...
![[Akoya - AkoyaCommentOnPurchaseItemAhuana.ogg]]

#### AkoyaCommentOnPurchaseItemKiloava
Hmm... curious...
![[Akoya - AkoyaCommentOnPurchaseItemKiloava.ogg]]

#### AkoyaCommentOnPurchaseEliteAhuana
Ahuana's warriors always fight with honour.
![[Akoya - AkoyaCommentOnPurchaseEliteAhuana.ogg]]

#### AkoyaCommentOnPurchaseEliteKiloava
A formidable choice.
![[Akoya - AkoyaCommentOnPurchaseEliteKiloava.ogg]]

#### AkoyaConversationWithAhuanaOne
Same as every other day down here.
![[Akoya - AkoyaConversationWithAhuanaOne.ogg]]

#### AkoyaConversationWithAhuanaTwo
Actually... yes!
![[Akoya - AkoyaConversationWithAhuanaTwo.ogg]]

#### AkoyaConversationWithKiloavaOne
Can you believe Hinekora accepted Kaom here?
![[Akoya - AkoyaConversationWithKiloavaOne.ogg]]

#### AkoyaConversationWithKiloavaTwo
Perhaps it is a chance to enact our vengeance...
![[Akoya - AkoyaConversationWithKiloavaTwo.ogg]]

#### AkoyaRandomShout1
Stop running! This is a sacred place!
![[Akoya - AkoyaRandomShout1.ogg]]

#### Tukohama
Our Father of War was the first to put axes in Karui hands. We learned that we could take from this world rather than accept what was given. Many of the other gods are generous, but why should we subsist in harmony with the land when we have the strength to be its masters?
![[Akoya - Tukohama.ogg]]

#### Tukohama_2
You have wounded us, outsider. Though he has slept for thousands of years, Tukohama plays a very real role in our cultural and spiritual lives. He helped create the Way, and he set the Ngakuramakoi on the proper path. With the defeat of our god, my tribe will suffer a mark of shame and a spiritual restlessness that I cannot overstate. I understand why you did what you did, and I will try to remain fair to you, but I am not certain I can ever forgive what you've done.
![[Akoya - Tukohama_2.ogg]]

#### Ngakuramakoi
That word, 'Karui,' is an informal name for anyone of the blood, whether a chieftain, a child, or a {kaivana}. The Ngakuramakoi, however, are those who truly comprise our culture. They must be followers of the Way, and they must have passed their test of adulthood, at the Isle of Shrikes or elsewhere. A great warrior does not have to be Karui by blood to become Ngakuramakoi. It is rare, but it does happen. I shall be watching you with great interest.
![[Akoya - Ngakuramakoi.ogg]]

#### Ngamahu
Thousands of years before I was born, the Tukohama Tribe and the Ngamahu Tribe were in continual conflict. A cycle of vengeance kept the two groups raiding each other, and they were beginning to lose their superior positions. There was a danger of the other tribes becoming dominant. To put an end to it, Ngamahu and Tukohama went through the traditions together. Tukohama aided her in the forging of a legendary axe, while her ring, a sign of fire and fertility, was given to us. Eventually, her ring passed down to me. Kaom took it, and my head, when he slew me in his bid to unite the tribes. It is our Way, but my defeat still stings.
![[Akoya - Ngamahu.ogg]]

#### Tawhanuku
I don't know what to make of the Hinekora tribe. They have always lived halfway in death and halfway in life. Their eyes are elsewhere, and their words are meaningless. They have some kind of strength, but I don't know what to make of it, and I certainly don't feel they are passing down any wisdom to their descendants when they speak in riddles. Maybe it's just the particular warriors here? I can't imagine their children talking in prophecies and enigmas.
![[Akoya - Tawhanuku.ogg]]

#### Death
My battle with Kaom began at sunrise. Our warriors were assembled on either side, ready to slaughter each other, but neither of us gave the sign. By dawn's light, we fought on the sand, axe against axe. Kaom was strong, but arrogant, which showed through in his fighting style. When he overextended himself, I made him pay for it in blood. However, his greater strength kept me on the defensive. Every hour, the {hatungo} called a truce, and we drank, ate, and were tended to. By nightfall, Kaom and I were moving like turtles, guarding ourselves behind our axes and taking only the most calculated movements. Eventually, he overextended again, and I dealt him a heavy wound to his chest but this was an acceptable sacrifice he had made on purpose. He broke my knee with the end of his axe handle, and that was it. He gave me a warrior's death, rather than leave me broken on the sands. I would not have had it any other way.
![[Akoya - Death.ogg]]

#### Utula
Now Utula has been accepted here, and his fiery words make me wary. I believe in the traditional and unchanging Way, but Utula wants to tear it all down. I fear he is seeking to fulfill Kitava's vow. We must show him how wrong he is.
![[Akoya - Utula.ogg]]

#### Ahuana
Like Ramako in stories, Ahuana is a ray of light in this dark place. The Halls of the Dead are a good thing, but the years keep passing, and weigh heavily on all of us. Kahuturoa was one of the first souls here, and I fear becoming like him. Right now, after only three centuries or so, I can still take the Way seriously and uphold all of our traditions with pride. What will I be like in thousands of years? With good friends like Ahuana remaining positive, perhaps I can make it to the end with my dignity.
![[Akoya - Ahuana.ogg]]

#### Kiloava
Kiloava makes grand claims about his own abilities, but he backs them up with the strength to win. I care little for bluster, so long as the warriors in these Halls adhere to the Way.
![[Akoya - Kiloava.ogg]]

#### The End of Time
Personally, I hope it will not be too long before the end. I have already existed three centuries longer than I was alive. Each tribe has its own belief about how the world will end, but you must understand, these tales do not conflict. They are all correct. Our traditional expectations are not literal. Our {hatungo} speaks of a time when all Ngakuramakoi will become so strong, and so skilled at warfare, that every man and woman will seek to become their own chieftain. Blood lust will take over the people, and war will continue until only one warrior remains. That warrior will be the strongest that ever lived in all of history, and he will die soon after from his wounds. His fallen body will become the new world, and his blood, the rivers. His dying warcry will become the sky, and his fierce eyes will become the new Sun and Moon. Of course, this is not a literal tale. It is meant to give us a sense of place in a chaotic existence. There is immense value in this. Our traditions give us meaning and purpose, that is why I have dedicated my life and my death to upholding them. Otherwise, we would be adrift, and full of fear.
![[Akoya - The End of Time.ogg]]

#### The Return of the Gods
Like many others, the Karui gods have awakened, but aside from Tukohama and Kitava, we have heard nothing of their activities. They walk Wraeclast like in times of old, so where are they? Our descendants come to us and ask us when the gods will return home. For this, we have no answer. Even Hinekora seems unwilling to speak on what she sees.
