## Alira Dialogue
#### The Darkness
You come to me in dark times, exile. No... dark isn't the right word for what's befallen my forest. Twisted it is, in every sense of the word.

#### The Darkness_2
Our forest has shaken off its malaise. It would seem that you are a carrier of clarity, not merely a vessel for violence. I adore that in an ally.

#### Hand in Amulets
That was almost better than Oriathan chocolate. You keep this trinket... to remember me by on your travels. I'd ask you to stay but I think we both know where that would lead. How does the old maxim go? Oh yes: "familiarity breeds contempt, and contempt is murder's concubine." A threat? No, my dear. Merely reality.

#### Alira's Rivals
Now go, my best of friends, and temper that sharp mind of yours in the blood of my enemies. I shall await your return with much... anticipation.

#### Alira's Rivals_2
A loner to the end, I see. Would you have chosen differently had you known how close that end could be?

#### Alira's Rivals_3
There's nothing quite so irksome as guests who have worn out their welcome. This is my forest now, and I intend to decorate it as I see fit. You are not the current fashion, darling. Be gone.

#### Alira's Rivals_4
You've a powerful aura... bright as a sunset before a storm. So let me rub an idea against that hot spirit of yours, see if it catches fire. My little tribe has two problems. Oak in the North, and Kraityn in the East. They succeed in making our lives in Wraeclast even more miserable. And then there's the matter of the amulets around their necks, the ones like mine here. {Stolen}. Taken when we three called each other 'friend'. There's power in those trinkets, enchantment enough to keep my tribe safe. Bring me a pair of amulets, and a pair of lying tongues, and I'll make you part of that power. You need friends in Wraeclast, and believe me: I can be a fine friend.

#### Alira's Rivals_5
Some scared little birds told me that you've cut down their tree. A big, ugly Oak. Can't say I'm surprised. You've a powerful aura on you... bright as a sunset before a storm. So let me rub an idea against that hot spirit of yours, see if it catches fire. The amulet I wear, sister to the one you took from Oak? Kraityn has its triplet. There's power in these trinkets, enchantment enough to keep my tribe safe. Go east, bring me an amulet, and Kraityn's lying tongue, and I'll make you part of that power. You need friends in Wraeclast, and believe me: I can be a fine friend.

#### Alira's Rivals_6
I caught some rats in my traps today. They told me an amusing tale: their rat king, Kraityn... dead. Can't say I'm surprised. You've a powerful aura on you... bright as a sunset before a storm. So let me rub an idea against that hot spirit of yours, see if it catches fire. The amulet I wear, sister to the one you took from Kraityn? Oak has its triplet. There's power in these trinkets, enchantment enough to keep my tribe safe. Go north, bring me an amulet, and Oak's lying tongue, and I'll make you part of that power. You need friends in Wraeclast, and believe me: I can be a fine friend.

#### Alira's Rivals_7
The king of rats, Kraityn? Dead. And that big, ugly Oak? Chopped down. You've made quite the impact around here. But I can't say I'm surprised. You've a powerful aura on you... bright as a sunset before a storm. Now, someone as resourceful as you would surely not have overlooked Oak's and Kraityn's amulets... the ones like mine here. There's power in those trinkets, enchantment enough to keep my friends and I safe. Give me the amulets and I'll gladly make you part of that power. You need friends in Wraeclast, and believe me: I can be a fine friend.

#### Alira's Rivals_8
You're one of Kraityn's bridge rats? But look at the aura on you: bright as the sunset before a storm. Not the mana of a minion. Kraityn's no doubt spun you a line about sharing the power of the amulets with you. No, he'll make sword grips out of your sun-dried entrails. Seen him do the likes a hundred times over. Bring me a pair of the amulets, and Kraityn's and Oak's lying tongues, and I promise to make you part of that power. I believe in friendship, and I can be a fine friend to those who treat me sweetly.

#### Alira's Rivals_9
Some scared little birds told me you've cut down their tree. A big, ugly Oak. Quite a feat. And yet now you're one of Kraityn's bridge rats? Look at the aura on you: bright as the sunset before a storm. Not the mana of a minion. Kraityn's no doubt spun you a line about sharing the power of the amulets with you. No, he'll make sword grips out of your sun-dried entrails. Seen him do the likes a hundred times over. Bring me a pair of the amulets, and Kraityn's lying tongue, and I promise to make you part of that power. I believe in friendship, and I can be a fine friend to those who treat me sweetly.

#### Alira's Rivals_10
You're one of Oak's squawking little parrots? But look at the aura on you: bright as the sunset before a storm. Not the mana of a minion. Oak's no doubt spun you a line about sharing the power of the amulets. No, he'll crack your head like a walnut. Seen him do the likes a hundred times over. Bring me a pair of amulets, and Oak's and Kraityn's lying tongues, and I promise to make you part of that power. I believe in friendship, and I can be a fine friend to those who treat me sweetly.

#### Alira's Rivals_11
I caught some rats in my traps today. They told me an amusing tale. Their rat king, Kraityn... dead. And yet now you're one of Oak's squawking little parrots? Look at the aura on you: bright as the sunset before a storm. Not the mana of a minion. Oak's no doubt spun you a line about divvying up the power of the amulets between the two of you. No, He'll take the power for himself and crack your head open like a walnut. Seen him do likes of that a hundred times over. Bring me a pair of amulets, and Oak's lying tongue, and I promise to make you part of that power. I believe in friendship, and I can be a fine friend to those who treat me sweetly.

#### Alira's Rivals_12
A rat floats belly-up in the river... pleasing news. But a journey half travelled is a journey wasted. Put an end to that lumbering oaf in the North and bring me his amulet. Then we'll talk... intimately, and at length.
![[Alira - Alira's Rivals_12.ogg]]

#### Alira's Rivals_13
You felled an Oak. I knew you had mana to spare. But a journey half travelled is a journey wasted. Put an end to that filthy rat in the East and bring me his amulet. Then we'll talk... intimately, and at length.
![[Alira - Alira's Rivals_13.ogg]]

#### Alira's Rivals_14
Reliable {and} deadly. What a truly lovely combination. I do hope you mentioned my name as Kraityn and Oak bled their last into the dirt. You did? How sweet. Now, the amulets, if you please. You and I have hungry spirits to satiate.
![[Alira - Alira's Rivals_14.ogg]]

#### Alira's Rivals_15
As much as I delight in your company, I find myself distracted. The thorns in my mattress, Kraityn and Oak, they continue to prick me. Remove the thorns and we shall both sleep much more easily.
