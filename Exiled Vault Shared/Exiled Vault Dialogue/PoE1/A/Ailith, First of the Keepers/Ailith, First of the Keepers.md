## Ailith, First of the Keepers
#### Introduction
Hmm... you seem sane enough to understand. Look to the wall ahead, and know that I speak the truth! Creatures from another world are invading Wraeclast, and we'll all be swarmed under soon enough - unless we do something. Take this graft. It will meld with your essence, and alter you, allowing you to wield our Flame against the invading Hiveborn!
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - Introduction.ogg]]

#### Accept the Graft
Accept my gift! If we are to work together against the Hiveborn, you must meld with the graft. There is no other choice!
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - Accept the Graft.ogg]]

#### Welcome to the War
You wield the Flame well enough. Welcome to the war! I am Ailith, founder of the Keepers of the Flame. I must return to our monastery for now to attend my duties, but I will rejoin you again... soon. When you encounter the Hiveborn, I will be there. You will not be alone in this fight.
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - Welcome to the War.ogg]]

#### Ailith_IntroFort
The outbreak of Hiveborn worsens! Use the Flame to get inside and I shall join you at its center. I will fulfill my duty... under your protection.
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - Ailith_IntroFort.ogg]]

#### Introduction_2
Welcome to our Monastery. Here, we spend our lives training ourselves to defend the sanctity of Wraeclast... and here, we protect our greatest weapon: the Genesis Tree.
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - Introduction_2.ogg]]

#### Ailith_OnGenesisTree
The Genesis Tree was stolen from the enemy, and gifted to us by the Dreamer. The Tree provides everything we need to sustain ourselves and protect this world from the Hiveborn. She is {life}, in its most essential form.
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - Ailith_OnGenesisTree.ogg]]

#### Ailith_OnGraftblood
Once you give her your wombgift, you must fertilise it with the blood of the Hiveborn. In battle, your graft will collect the enemy's flesh, and pulp it to extract graftblood. Bring the blood back here, and give it to the Genesis Tree. She will use it to grow what you desire.
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - Ailith_OnGraftblood.ogg]]

#### The Genesis Tree
She approves. You are now bonded. If you desire more, you will need more wombgifts and graftblood. We should continue seeking out the Hiveborn and closing their breaches. The fruits of war shall become our weapons.
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - The Genesis Tree.ogg]]

#### Gifts for the Genesis Tree
I was sent a dream about this... we can give this piece of the enemy to the Genesis Tree to cultivate her growth. I will attach it to her. Bring me more like this, if you find them...
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - Gifts for the Genesis Tree.ogg]]

#### Gifts for the Genesis Tree_2
A healthy subject. I shall attach it to the Genesis Tree. Watch as she grows!
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - Gifts for the Genesis Tree_2.ogg]]

#### Gifts for the Genesis Tree_3
With each victory, we shift the balance of power.
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - Gifts for the Genesis Tree_3.ogg]]

#### Gifts for the Genesis Tree_4
This should aid the Genesis Tree's growth once more.
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - Gifts for the Genesis Tree_4.ogg]]

#### Gifts for the Genesis Tree_5
You're doing well. I accept this offering to the Genesis Tree.
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - Gifts for the Genesis Tree_5.ogg]]

#### Gifts for the Genesis Tree_6
She grows once more. Behold.
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - Gifts for the Genesis Tree_6.ogg]]

#### Gifts for the Genesis Tree_7
The Genesis Tree nears perfection.
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - Gifts for the Genesis Tree_7.ogg]]

#### Gifts for the Genesis Tree_8
The head of Vruun. I've long dreamt of this moment... I believe you are ready. Few survive a second melding, but I have faith in you. Try it. Try to meld with a second graft to your flesh!
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - Gifts for the Genesis Tree_8.ogg]]

#### Gifts for the Genesis Tree_9
Such power... the remains of Esh and Tul glimmer with the energies of the Breachlords themselves... consuming these, the Genesis Tree will surge with newfound strength.
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - Gifts for the Genesis Tree_9.ogg]]

#### Second Meld
I knew it. You survived a second melding. Now, you can bear two grafts in the war against the Hiveborn. Truly, this is a momentous day!
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - Second Meld.ogg]]

#### Fertilising the Genesis Tree
The Tree accepts your gift of graftblood.
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - Fertilising the Genesis Tree.ogg]]

#### Fertilising the Genesis Tree_2
Your bond deepens.
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - Fertilising the Genesis Tree_2.ogg]]

#### Fertilising the Genesis Tree_3
Can you feel her gratitude?
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - Fertilising the Genesis Tree_3.ogg]]

#### Fertilising the Genesis Tree_4
She opens herself to you.
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - Fertilising the Genesis Tree_4.ogg]]

#### Fertilising the Genesis Tree_5
The blood-bond grows thick.
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - Fertilising the Genesis Tree_5.ogg]]

#### Fertilising the Genesis Tree_6
Your hearts beat as one.
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - Fertilising the Genesis Tree_6.ogg]]

#### Fertilising the Genesis Tree_7
The bonding is complete. You and the Genesis Tree are inextricably linked, now.
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - Fertilising the Genesis Tree_7.ogg]]

#### The Hiveborn
They come from another world... a barren world... and they crave our living land and sky. Our Unbroken Sun. They cannot be allowed to gain a foothold here, or they will poison Wraeclast the same way they poisoned themselves.
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - The Hiveborn.ogg]]

#### The Monastery
I founded the Keepers of the Flame long ago... this place is our haven. A sacrosanct location where we care for the Genesis Tree. The Keepers serve, and are served by, the Benevolent Dreamer. His teachings and gifts keep us on the path of discipline and truth.
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - The Monastery.ogg]]

#### The Keepers
When our minds transcend our mortal coil, the Benevolent Dreamer guides us with visions and portents. Though it is not our only purpose, long has he prepared us for the war against the Hiveborn.
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - The Keepers.ogg]]

#### Visions
I live half in dream. To you, that may sound strange, but truth lies beyond the wall of sleep. It is the very foundation of our faith. Dreams are more real to me now than the waking world is to you.
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - Visions.ogg]]

#### Xesht
The Esh and Tul you faced were not the originals. Something has changed among the Hiveborn. The species of creature we once knew as the Breach Lords are now subordinate to an entity known as Xesht, as if they put their primary willpower into a collective being. This event must have been the catalyst for their sudden surge on Wraeclast. They're hungry for something... seeking something... but it's chaotic and frantic, driven by madness. Their disorder may give us an opportunity to destroy them.
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - Xesht.ogg]]

#### The Hidden Room
What are you talking about? It's just a storage room. You remember, you were there. Let's focus on important things.
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - The Hidden Room.ogg]]

#### The Assault
This... {thing}... it's a foothold in our world. A staging ground for a hive. There, enemies are being grown, trained, and equipped. We have to assault it now, before they're ready. When you reach its heart, I will join you, and we will destroy it... together.
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - The Assault.ogg]]

#### The Hive
The horror is in the name: Hiveborn. They are not brought into this world the way you and I are. They are {gestated} in vast hives, with minds and bodies shaped to serve their masters. I cannot imagine a worse existence. {That} is what we will find up there - a swarming nest of drones, their minds built on whatever foul ideas the Breachlords want them to believe.
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - The Hive.ogg]]

#### Destruction
You destroyed a Hive! I can't imagine what it took you to do so. I'll remain here to study what is left of it. Carry on, and we shall reconvene soon.
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - Destruction.ogg]]

#### Destroyed Hive
The enemy reels at the destruction of one of their hives. You've done well. I only wish I could have been there to see them burn.
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - Destroyed Hive.ogg]]

#### Looking Pale
You're looking a little pale. I hope you're feeling alright. The war does not wait for any of us, after all!
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - Looking Pale.ogg]]

#### Ailith_FlameGlyphOne
Ailith, you must...
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - Ailith_FlameGlyphOne.ogg]]

#### Ailith_FlameGlyphTwo
... remember! You just...
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - Ailith_FlameGlyphTwo.ogg]]

#### Ailith_FlameGlyphThree
... woke from a dream...
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - Ailith_FlameGlyphThree.ogg]]

#### Ailith_FlameGlyphFour
... didn't you? It's all a lie!
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - Ailith_FlameGlyphFour.ogg]]

#### Ailith_FlameGlyphFive
...The Dreamer has betrayed us...
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - Ailith_FlameGlyphFive.ogg]]

#### Ailith_FlameGlyphSix
... Don't go back...
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - Ailith_FlameGlyphSix.ogg]]

#### Ailith_FlameGlyphSeven
... to the Monastery. Run while you still can!
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - Ailith_FlameGlyphSeven.ogg]]

#### Ailith_TruthGlyph
Time is a sacred gift. Each moment must be spent in disciplined pursuit of perfection. Suffering is a sacred gift. Hunger, thirst, and pain are all signposts on the road. Flesh is a sacred gift. It grows and adapts, a forge unlike any other. Truth lies beyond the wall of sleep. All else is an illusion.
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - Ailith_TruthGlyph.ogg]]

#### Ailith_Wild_CalloutCoast
Come here, quickly!
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - Ailith_Wild_CalloutCoast.ogg]]

#### Ailith_Wild_GraftPrompt
Go on. Meld it to your flesh.
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - Ailith_Wild_GraftPrompt.ogg]]

#### Ailith_Wild_GraftPromptTwo
We're running out of time!
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - Ailith_Wild_GraftPromptTwo.ogg]]

#### The Barrier
Oh good, you survived the melding! Now, test your new self. Wield the Flame against that wall.
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - The Barrier.ogg]]

#### Ailith_Wild_DestroyWallImpatient_Random
Use the Flame to destroy the wall.
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - Ailith_Wild_DestroyWallImpatient_Random.ogg]]

Do not be afraid. Use the Flame.
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - Ailith_Wild_DestroyWallImpatient_2.ogg]]

#### Ailith_Wild_WallDestroyed
By the Dreamer! You did it!
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - Ailith_Wild_WallDestroyed.ogg]]

#### Ailith_Wild_CalloutFortFirstTime
We need to break this wall and get inside! Use the Flame!
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - Ailith_Wild_CalloutFortFirstTime.ogg]]

#### Ailith_Wild_TutorialFortPortInOne
You did it! You exposed the centre!
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - Ailith_Wild_TutorialFortPortInOne.ogg]]

#### Ailith_Wild_TutorialFortPortInTwo
I can destroy this rift, I just need time! Defend me while I focus my will!
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - Ailith_Wild_TutorialFortPortInTwo.ogg]]

#### Ailith_Wild_FortFirstTimePortalIn_Random

None shall pass!

I will slay every last one of you!

This world isn't yours to conquer!

Retreat, hiveborn!

You had no right!

Not anymore. I reject you. I reject this perverse existence!

A fell wind blows.

#### Visions I, 40: Birth
I walked alongside a hooded figure, picking our way along a high ridge. He pointed to the stinking valley below, where vast ribs pulsed with the beat of a mountainous heart. He asked me what I saw. I told him that I saw half of a body, of sorts. Exposed to the elements. Both terrifying, yet vulnerable. He nodded. The Mother births flesh, but flesh is weak. It can be burned. Seared away. She wants her children to remain one with her, but children must leave home to thrive. The Dreamer once knew her, before the nightmare she became, but that is only a memory of sorrow. She will try to take our flesh, he warned. We must not let her.

#### Visions II, 18: Flame
The Dreamer led me through a great furnace, where slaves shoveled coal into vast flues, their limbs melting, their eyes blind. He pointed to the charnel pits. He asked me what I saw. I told him that I saw a hunger beyond any other. A need that could never be sated, that could only exist by consuming ever more. He nodded. The Red Pyre burns hot, but flames are ephemeral. They can be quenched. Doused. Flames can never endure, only spread. The Dreamer once knew him, before his addiction, but that is only a memory of regret. He will try to burn us, he warned. We must not let him.

#### Visions III, 91: Thought
Voiceless whispers chattered like bone-dry teeth as the Dreamer led me through a vast labyrinth of metal veins and pulsing arteries. He pointed to the sky, the center, where a crystalline face spun, its eyes hollow, its stark jaw mouthing unheard rantings. He asked me what I saw. I hesitated. I thought I knew, but did not trust myself. In a world so filled with ghastly flesh, here, then, was a mind without it. He nodded. The Forked Psyche thinks without will, decides without desire. It drains all motion and life to voice thoughts that no one hears; to decipher truths without meaning. The Dreamer once knew her, before she relinquished her soul, but that is only a memory of despair. She will try to swallow our minds, he warned. We must not let her.
![[Ailith, First of the Keepers - Visions III, 91: Thought.ogg]]

#### Visions IV, 7: Death
Weakened from our long journey, the Dreamer sat beside a chilly hollow, one of many, laid out in vast lonely rows. He pointed down, at the being within, silent and still. He asked me what I saw. Quite fearful now, I took a moment to answer. The aura was unmistakable. This was a graveyard. For the first time, he shook his head. The Preserved Patterns do not venerate the dead. They live still, eyes open, hands frozen while grasping for freedom from the icy will that holds them in thrall. The Dreamer once knew her, when her heart still held passion, but that is only a memory of loss. She will try to imprison our bodies, he warned. We must not let her.

#### Visions V, 104: His Gift
Weary now, the Dreamer bade me sit beside him. We had come full circle in my nights spent dreaming, and now sat outside our very own Monastery. He pointed out, at the world beyond, and asked me what I saw. A verdant, beautiful, living world, I told him. Unspoiled. He nodded. The Four have become One, he warned. He tried to help them, tried to mitigate the agonies in their souls that drove them like whips at their backs, but they lashed out. Wounded him; cast him into the void. They had purpose before, but now, know only rage and hunger. Their patchwork existence tears at the seams, filling their thoughts with nothing but screams. They will be coming, he warned. We must not let them. With that, he faltered, lay on the soil, and slept. When I awoke, I was in that very same spot, and the Genesis Tree had sprouted its first branches, right where the Dreamer lay. It is his gift to us... our armoury against the Hiveborn. We will not fail him.

#### Gifts for the Genesis Tree_10
Ah, you've already engaged the enemy! This Horned Skull bears their essence. We can give this to the Genesis Tree to cultivate her growth. I will attach it to her. Bring me more like this, if you find them...
