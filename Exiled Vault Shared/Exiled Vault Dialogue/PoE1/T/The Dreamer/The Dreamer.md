## The Dreamer
#### Introduction
Keep this secret... and I shall answer.
![[The Dreamer - Introduction.ogg]]

#### Chayula_A_02
You... may call me ally... for now.
![[The Dreamer - Chayula_A_02.ogg]]

#### Chayula_A_03
To exist... to continue.
![[The Dreamer - Chayula_A_03.ogg]]

#### Chayula_A_04
We are the same... we are opposites.
![[The Dreamer - Chayula_A_04.ogg]]

#### Chayula_A_05
None are safe... while the enemy rampages.
![[The Dreamer - Chayula_A_05.ogg]]

#### Chayula_A_06
... Xesht.
![[The Dreamer - Chayula_A_06.ogg]]

#### Chayula_A_07
Unity of flesh... with no care as to how... or {where}... it is found.
![[The Dreamer - Chayula_A_07.ogg]]

#### Chayula_A_08
For now... we fight... the rest will become clear... in time.
![[The Dreamer - Chayula_A_08.ogg]]

#### Chayula_B_02
The Keepers know me... as the Benevolent Dreamer. The enemy knows me... as the One Who Dreamt. You... may call me ally... for now.
![[The Dreamer - Chayula_B_02.ogg]]

#### Chayula_B_03
The willow bends with the storm... but too strong a gale... and it may snap.
![[The Dreamer - Chayula_B_03.ogg]]

#### Chayula_B_04
Shattered hopes drift across the void... what is broken can never be repaired.
![[The Dreamer - Chayula_B_04.ogg]]

#### Chayula_B_05
Two fates intertwine... not the unity desired, but the only unity at hand... the enemy is nigh.
![[The Dreamer - Chayula_B_05.ogg]]

#### Chayula_B_06
The Hand closed at long last, bringing five into one... a flaw glimmered in a perfect crystal... the Dream ruptured, and the Dreamer was torn asunder... four became one, jagged and imbalanced... Xesht.
![[The Dreamer - Chayula_B_06.ogg]]

#### Chayula_B_07
Endless rage and hunger... seeks only unity of flesh... with no care... how or where it is found.
![[The Dreamer - Chayula_B_07.ogg]]

#### Chayula_B_08
Each day dawns red from the smoke of war. Two paths flank the same river... for now.
![[The Dreamer - Chayula_B_08.ogg]]

#### What do you want?
To exist... to preserve my essence... to endure what looms.
![[The Dreamer - What do you want?.ogg]]

#### How do they know you?
Broken bonds now ache like severed limbs.
![[The Dreamer - How do they know you?.ogg]]

#### Why should I trust you?
We share the same fate... the enemy grows near.
![[The Dreamer - Why should I trust you?.ogg]]

#### Who is our enemy?
Xoph... Esh... Tul... Uul-Netol... our melding... failed... I was torn asunder. Cast into the void between worlds. They... became Xesht.
![[The Dreamer - Who is our enemy?.ogg]]

#### What does Xesht want?
Xesht is imbalanced... four minds sewn together, vying for dominance... filled with endless rage and hunger they do not understand. Seeking only unity of flesh... with no care... how or where it is found.
![[The Dreamer - What does Xesht want?.ogg]]

#### What now?
Fight. Ailith will aid you. She must continue her duties here... unburdened by the pain of truth. I must... regenerate. Keep our enemy at bay... and the path we share... shall {remain} clear.
![[The Dreamer - What now?.ogg]]

#### Chayula_Cine_One
Ailith. This was never meant for your eyes.
![[The Dreamer - Chayula_Cine_One.ogg]]

#### Chayula_Cine_Two
No. You... are not mindless... you died, long ago. I preserved your essence.
![[The Dreamer - Chayula_Cine_Two.ogg]]

#### Chayula_Cine_Three
I had every right. For you belong to me.
![[The Dreamer - Chayula_Cine_Three.ogg]]

#### Chayula_Cine_Four
So be it. I revoke my gift.
![[The Dreamer - Chayula_Cine_Four.ogg]]

#### Chayula_Cine_Five
I... would speak with you.
![[The Dreamer - Chayula_Cine_Five.ogg]]

Enough.
![[The Dreamer - Chayula_Glyph_7.ogg]]

No more.
![[The Dreamer - Chayula_Glyph_10.ogg]]

Cease.
![[The Dreamer - Chayula_Glyph_13.ogg]]

#### Chayula_Glyph_15
No.
![[The Dreamer - Chayula_Glyph_15.ogg]]

#### Chayula_Truth_Random
I told you not to tell her.
![[The Dreamer - Chayula_Truth_Random.ogg]]

#### Chayula_Truth_4
The secret must be kept.
![[The Dreamer - Chayula_Truth_4.ogg]]

#### Chayula_Truth_7
Do not violate our agreement.
![[The Dreamer - Chayula_Truth_7.ogg]]

#### Chayula_Truth_10
There are consequences.
![[The Dreamer - Chayula_Truth_10.ogg]]

#### Chayula_A_Wild_01
Keep the secret... allies we remain.
![[The Dreamer - Chayula_A_Wild_01.ogg]]

#### Chayula_B_Wild_01
Beware Xesht.... no dreams remain... only nightmares.
![[The Dreamer - Chayula_B_Wild_01.ogg]]
