#### KuraiContractTwoVicToKuraiOne
Well would you look at that. Didn't think you'd come in person! How are you, lady Kurai? Did you enjoy the book?

#### KuraiContractTwoVicToKuraiTwo
If you wish for this to be unpleasant, so be it. I want my book back.

Where is it?

#### KuraiContractTwoVicToKuraiFour
Kurai, Kurai, Kurai... Don't you feel you're being unfair? You did, after all, break into my home. You took something which I value. O' Eternal. A first edition. Signed by Victario himself. My parents, rest their souls, were so fond of his work that I was named after him! Am I not owed some sort of... reparations?

#### KuraiContractTwoVicToKuraiFive
I want {my} book. And since you don't have it... Kurai, I presume this is the thief? I know you don't do your own dirty work.

Tell you what... You can keep the book. Give me the thief's head, and we'll call it even.

Then I will consider the theft an act of aggression against the Vox family. An act of war.
