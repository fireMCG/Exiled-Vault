## Vorici, Silent Brother Dialogue
#### VoriciPrimaryDefenderStartsFightZero
Another malcontent with a death wish... so be it.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciPrimaryDefenderStartsFightZero.ogg]]

#### VoriciPrimaryDefenderStartsFightOne
It seems you possess bravery and foolishness in equal abundance.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciPrimaryDefenderStartsFightOne.ogg]]

#### VoriciPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwo
You are becoming a nuisance.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwo.ogg]]

#### VoriciPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThree
You're early! No matter... loose threads must be severed.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThree.ogg]]

#### VoriciPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFour
We do not tolerate selfish malcontents.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFour.ogg]]

#### VoriciPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFive
Don't worry, Exile, I won't submit you to the same humiliation of imprisonment. A quick death will do.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFive.ogg]]

#### VoriciPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSix
Did you forget our deal so quickly, Exile? How disappointing.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSix.ogg]]

#### VoriciPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSeven
My conscience is still bloodied, malcontent. Soon my weapons will match.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSeven.ogg]]

#### VoriciPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEight
I have experienced enough death. I believe I'd rather stay here.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEight.ogg]]

#### VoriciPrimaryDefenderStartsFightNine
I knew you were a fool, but you continue to disappoint.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciPrimaryDefenderStartsFightNine.ogg]]

#### VoriciPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTen
I will answer the pain you inflicted tenfold!
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTen.ogg]]

#### VoriciPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEleven
I see energy swimming within you. I will cut it free.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEleven.ogg]]

#### VoriciPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwelve
I've returned from the void. I brought a piece back with me.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwelve.ogg]]

#### VoriciPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThirteen
I live once more. Does madness yet grip your mind?
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThirteen.ogg]]

#### VoriciPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFourteen
The stench of death... you'll reek of it soon enough.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFourteen.ogg]]

#### VoriciSafehouseLeaderIntroZero
You have become tangled in our tapestry, Exile. Time to cut you free.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciSafehouseLeaderIntroZero.ogg]]

#### VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero
You can't weave a tapestry with just one thread.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero.ogg]]

#### VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne
We can't let our cargo fall into the hands of a malcontent.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne.ogg]]

#### VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo
No loose threads.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo.ogg]]

#### VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree
Let's keep this professional. Quick and clean.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree.ogg]]

#### VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour
Need to keep the skills sharp. It's nothing personal.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour.ogg]]

#### VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive
Show me the might of those Ancestors you won't shut up about.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive.ogg]]

#### VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix
You might be uncouth and unclean, Tora, but I like the way you hunt.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix.ogg]]

#### VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven
Vagan, show some civility. Kill them quickly.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven.ogg]]

#### VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight
I've half a mind to slay you myself, Gravicius - but not today.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight.ogg]]

#### VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine
Show me what you're capable of, Aisling.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine.ogg]]

#### VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalTen
Let's kill this selfish malcontent.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalTen.ogg]]

#### VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalEleven
Did you think it would be that simple, Exile?
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalEleven.ogg]]

#### VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwelve
All my loose threads boxed in. How convenient.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwelve.ogg]]

#### VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirteen
Bad apples must be plucked and disposed of.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirteen.ogg]]

#### VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalFourteen
My, my, what a mess this is. You know I hate a mess.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalFourteen.ogg]]

#### VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalFifteen
No. Loose. Threads.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalFifteen.ogg]]

#### VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalSixteen
If it's any consolation, Leo, I don't expect you to die without a fight.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalSixteen.ogg]]

#### VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeventeen
Your faith-blind eyes have deceived you, old man. Don't worry, I'll pluck them out for you.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeventeen.ogg]]

#### VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalEighteen
Consider this the Brotherhood collecting on an old debt, Perandus.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalEighteen.ogg]]

#### VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalNineteen
Please beg for your life, Gravicius, so that I can have the pleasure of refusing you.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalNineteen.ogg]]

#### VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwenty
You make a mockery of man's finest moment, Aisling. The dead deserve respect.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwenty.ogg]]

#### VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyOne
How fortunate, all my loose threads in one place!
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyOne.ogg]]

#### VoriciReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero
You selfish malcontent.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero.ogg]]

#### VoriciReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne
You're late. You know how I hate tardiness.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne.ogg]]

#### VoriciReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo
Another loose thread needing to be snipped.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo.ogg]]

#### VoriciReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree
You were next on my list anyway.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree.ogg]]

#### VoriciReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour
Fair? I'd have to give you one of my arms for this to be fair.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour.ogg]]

#### VoriciReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive
I think I'll pass.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive.ogg]]

#### VoriciReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix
What's more natural than the cycle of life and death? I'm just helping things along.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix.ogg]]

#### VoriciReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven
I told you to stop calling me that. Now I'll make you stop.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven.ogg]]

#### VoriciReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight
Oh, death's not my weapon, General. It's my closest ally. Allow me to introduce you!
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight.ogg]]

#### VoriciReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine
You'll find me a most disagreeable mark.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine.ogg]]

#### VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyTwo
What beautiful violence we will weave together.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyTwo.ogg]]

#### VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyThree
Come, noble ally. Let us cut this misfit down together.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyThree.ogg]]

#### VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFour
A partner of such enlightenment. How pleasant.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFour.ogg]]

#### VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFive
Elegance and sophistication. Try to enjoy this, Exile.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFive.ogg]]

#### VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySix
Crusade all you like, Elreon, just follow my orders.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySix.ogg]]

#### VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySeven
I think I can rely on you to do some cutting, yes?
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySeven.ogg]]

#### VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyEight
This time you're working for an assassin. I do love irony.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyEight.ogg]]

#### VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyNine
Your orders are simple, Cameria. Kill them all.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyNine.ogg]]

#### VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirty
This situation needs a bit less cutting and a bit more intellect.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirty.ogg]]

#### VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirtyOne
Looks like this situation's in need of some cutting intellect.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirtyOne.ogg]]

#### VoriciKillPlayerZero
A nice, clean kill.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciKillPlayerZero.ogg]]

#### VoriciKillPlayerOne
I do like a tidy ending.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciKillPlayerOne.ogg]]

#### VoriciKillPlayerTwo
Secrets remain secret.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciKillPlayerTwo.ogg]]

#### VoriciKillPlayerThree
A shame. I rather liked that villain.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciKillPlayerThree.ogg]]

#### VoriciEscapeZero
Consider this a warning, Exile.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciEscapeZero.ogg]]

#### VoriciEscapeOne
We inch closer to utopia.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciEscapeOne.ogg]]

#### VoriciEscapeTwo
A necessary loss.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciEscapeTwo.ogg]]

#### VoriciDefeatedZero
Defeated... within my own walls.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciDefeatedZero.ogg]]

#### VoriciDefeatedOne
A costly error.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciDefeatedOne.ogg]]

#### VoriciDefeatedTwo
How uncivilised...
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciDefeatedTwo.ogg]]

#### VoriciDefeatedThree
Deeply disappointing.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciDefeatedThree.ogg]]

#### VoriciDefeatedFour
Perhaps my time in confinement had a larger impact than I anticipated.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciDefeatedFour.ogg]]

#### VoriciDefeatedFive
I... want another moment of your time...
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciDefeatedFive.ogg]]

#### VoriciDefeatedSix
I was a fool to work with you.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciDefeatedSix.ogg]]

#### VoriciDefeatedSeven
I faced death before... what's once more?
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciDefeatedSeven.ogg]]

#### VoriciDefeatedEight
You! You have improved!
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciDefeatedEight.ogg]]

#### VoriciDefeatedNine
How inelegant...
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciDefeatedNine.ogg]]

#### VoriciDefeatedTen
Foiled by my own selfishness. Humiliating.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciDefeatedTen.ogg]]

#### VoriciOfferBargainZero
Even an ignoramus like yourself can see you have the upper hand. What do you want?
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciOfferBargainZero.ogg]]

#### VoriciOfferBargainOne
If you kill me, another will take my place, and you will have made a target of yourself. The sensible action would be to sow the seeds of loyalty within the Syndicate. Whisper a name, and they will soon find themselves at my side.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciOfferBargainOne.ogg]]

#### VoriciOfferBargainTwo
Killing me will bring you no closer to your precious artefacts. Not even I know where they have been secreted, but I may know who does, and I know how to ingratiate myself with them. All you have to do is free me.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciOfferBargainTwo.ogg]]

#### VoriciOfferBargainThree
It seems to me that no job is worth dying over, least of all this one. I propose that I leave here - alive - and find a task more suitable to my disposition. Of course, this would involve an exchange. What say you?
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciOfferBargainThree.ogg]]

#### VoriciOfferBargainFour
I can see that you are more than capable of claiming my head. Don't. I will see myself out of here - and out of the Syndicate - and I will not return.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciOfferBargainFour.ogg]]

#### VoriciOfferBargainFive
Wars are not won on the battlefront, Exile. They're won in the dimly lit rooms, over maps and dossiers. I hold information you may find valuable. Allow me to leave here alive, and that information is yours.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciOfferBargainFive.ogg]]

#### VoriciOfferBargainSix
The Syndicate is not just a cluster of like-minded individuals. We have a very wealthy benefactor, who would be very sad to see me dead, but would most certainly look the other way if I were to offer you recompense.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciOfferBargainSix.ogg]]

#### VoriciBargainAcceptedZero
I knew you were sharp. Consider it done.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciBargainAcceptedZero.ogg]]

#### VoriciBargainAcceptedOne
So be it. But if word of our deal makes it to other ears, I will cut out your tongue.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciBargainAcceptedOne.ogg]]

#### VoriciBargainAcceptedTwo
A wise decision. I do hope we cross paths again.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciBargainAcceptedTwo.ogg]]

#### VoriciBargainAcceptedThree
Then I am gone. With any luck, I will not be drawn into this mess again.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciBargainAcceptedThree.ogg]]

#### VoriciBargainAcceptedFour
The tapestry we weave is complex indeed. What will you do with this information, I wonder...
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciBargainAcceptedFour.ogg]]

#### VoriciBargainAcceptedFive
There could be no simpler exchange.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciBargainAcceptedFive.ogg]]

#### VoriciOfferBetrayalZero
My immediate superior has many secrets, Exile. Secrets that would turn your stomach. Were I to reveal these secrets to the rest of the Syndicate I have no doubt that my 'esteemed' leader here would be relegated to a much more menial position, and you would be forced to endure far less of their company. We are killers, but not all of us are monsters.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciOfferBetrayalZero.ogg]]

#### VoriciOfferBetrayalOne
It seems clear to me that our failure is due to the machinations of other Syndicate members, and were you to let me go, I would make that crystal-clear. The others here will be punished for their part and I will be rewarded. The Syndicate does not value loyalty, they value results, and today, they didn't get results.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciOfferBetrayalOne.ogg]]

#### VoriciOfferBetrayalTwo
If it's blood you want, I propose an exchange. Release me, and I will take the life of another. I hold no true loyalty to my Syndicate brethren. Is my blood any more valuable than that of another Syndicate member?
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciOfferBetrayalTwo.ogg]]

#### VoriciOfferBetrayalThree
You are after the crown. The Eternal One. The Lifegiver. I see the tapestry for what it is. Only information will bring you closer. Information I possess, taken from the mouths of the others here today. How much is this information worth to you, Exile?
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciOfferBetrayalThree.ogg]]

#### VoriciOfferBetrayalFour
Faith, or perhaps age, has rotted away Elreon's mind. The things he whispers in his sleep... they make me look positively devout.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciOfferBetrayalFour.ogg]]

#### VoriciOfferBetrayalFive
I don't think I need remind you what young Janus here has done. I think you'll find a fitting punishment.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciOfferBetrayalFive.ogg]]

#### VoriciOfferBetrayalSix
Few men deserve betrayal more than Gravicius. I am not one of them.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciOfferBetrayalSix.ogg]]

#### VoriciOfferBetrayalSeven
Thane Jorgin was cast out of his homeland after the 'mysterious' death of his brother. The implication is clear.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciOfferBetrayalSeven.ogg]]

#### VoriciOfferBetrayalEight
I'm an assassin, yes, but Aisling is something far worse.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciOfferBetrayalEight.ogg]]

#### VoriciOfferBetrayalNine
Let's make a deal.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciOfferBetrayalNine.ogg]]

#### VoriciOfferExecuteZero
If you think I am going to say or do anything to further your pathetic cause, you are sorely mistaken.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciOfferExecuteZero.ogg]]

#### VoriciOfferExecuteOne
I'd sooner die than forsake my loyalty to the Syndicate.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciOfferExecuteOne.ogg]]

#### VoriciOfferExecuteTwo
I know what you want from me, malcontent. But as long as Syndicate eyes are cast upon us, I will give you nothing.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciOfferExecuteTwo.ogg]]

#### VoriciOfferExecuteThree
I would rather rot on the ground here than in some filthy, uncivilised prison cell.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciOfferExecuteThree.ogg]]

#### VoriciReplyToBetrayalAcceptedZero
Well that is disappointing.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciReplyToBetrayalAcceptedZero.ogg]]

#### VoriciReplyToBetrayalAcceptedOne
I've been nothing but a perfect gentleman, huntress - to your face, at least.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciReplyToBetrayalAcceptedOne.ogg]]

#### VoriciReplyToBetrayalAcceptedTwo
We should have cut you loose long ago, Vagan.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciReplyToBetrayalAcceptedTwo.ogg]]

#### VoriciReplyToBetrayalAcceptedThree
Once a turncoat, always a turncoat.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciReplyToBetrayalAcceptedThree.ogg]]

#### VoriciReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFour
For this, General, I will pluck you free of the tapestry myself.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFour.ogg]]

#### VoriciReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFive
It was not I who killed your brother, Thane. But I think you know that full well.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFive.ogg]]

#### VoriciReplyToBetrayalAcceptedSix
My retribution will be swift, invisible, and painful.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciReplyToBetrayalAcceptedSix.ogg]]

#### VoriciInterrogatedZero
You will have to cut the words from my mouth.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciInterrogatedZero.ogg]]

#### VoriciInterrogatedOne
Cruel. Truly cruel.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciInterrogatedOne.ogg]]

#### VoriciInterrogatedTwo
What? I thought you were reasonable.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciInterrogatedTwo.ogg]]

#### VoriciReplyToExecutionZero
What a waste.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciReplyToExecutionZero.ogg]]

#### VoriciReplyToExecutionOne
At least it was quick.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciReplyToExecutionOne.ogg]]

#### VoriciReplyToExecutionTwo
I will savour that image.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciReplyToExecutionTwo.ogg]]

#### VoriciSafehouseLeaderDefeatedZero
You... only delay our inexorable rise.
![[Vorici, Silent Brother - VoriciSafehouseLeaderDefeatedZero.ogg]]
