## Kira Dialogue
#### Introduction
We opened the gates to you for two reasons only. Dominus and Piety. They made themselves our enemies. You made them dead. Now Oyun believes there is a third reason. The Beast is our enemy. Perhaps you can make it dead as well?
![[Kira - Introduction.ogg]]

#### __intro_part2__
I have seen the look in Piety's eyes. I see the look in your eyes, Witch. It is not as different as I had hoped. No matter. The knife in your hand is better than the spear in the rack.
![[Kira - __intro_part2__.ogg]]

#### __intro_part2___2
This land is a wounded animal, its torn flesh infected by Nightmare. Before you put this animal out of its misery, be sure, Ranger, to give thought to those who live on its back.
![[Kira - __intro_part2___2.ogg]]

#### __intro_part2___3
Dominus was High Templar in Oriath, was he not? Your God needs to be more careful when He chooses His servants. Then again, perhaps He learns from His mistakes. We shall see.
![[Kira - __intro_part2___3.ogg]]

#### __intro_part2___4
We Maraketh are tied to our {akhara}, our tribe. You are a man who has cut his ties, Shadow. A man without restraint can achieve the greatest of deeds... and the worst. Perhaps it is time to allow yourself to be lashed to something greater than simply {you}.
![[Kira - __intro_part2___4.ogg]]

#### __intro_part2___5
Pride is a common flaw in men. We Maraketh beat such sickness out of our boys. Do you know why, Duelist? If left unchecked, pride becomes a plague. There is a cure, of course. It's called 'devotion'.
![[Kira - __intro_part2___5.ogg]]

#### __intro_part2___6
The Maraketh and the Karui have fought side by side in the past. And side by side, we were lied to and used. History must not be allowed to repeat. Let us share only the truth, Marauder, so that we may wipe our memories clean.
![[Kira - __intro_part2___6.ogg]]

#### __intro_part2___7
We Maraketh have a saying, Scion. "Only the night can understand the darkness. Only the sun can bring about the dawn."
![[Kira - __intro_part2___7.ogg]]

#### The Mines
Deshret's banner flies at the Mines' entrance and now the darkness gapes, hungry and expectant. Our Red Sekhema sealed that gate for a reason. Not simply to prevent the Beast from reaching out, but to hinder those fools who would disturb its slumber. And here you are, about to be swallowed by that darkness. Let us hope the Beast doesn't notice your passing.
![[Kira - The Mines.ogg]]

#### Trading
Oyun has ordered me to help you, to trade with you. I have risked much to gather weapons and armour for this {akhara}. I've scavenged on the fringes of Voll's encampment, and scouted the Dead City. Let us see if you can offer any value in return.
![[Kira - Trading.ogg]]

#### Voll
I've led many a war party against Voll and his unmen, and I've seen too many of my {dekhara} die. I shall look for your return, but I shall not expect it.
![[Kira - Voll.ogg]]

#### Voll_2
Hundreds of our {dekhara} have fallen to Voll and his legion throughout the years. They died defending their {akhara}. Now Voll is gone, killed by an outsider. You bask in the glory, exile, while I honour the dead.
![[Kira - Voll_2.ogg]]

#### Petarus and Vanja
As we give strength to the outside, we grow weaker on the inside. First, there was Petarus and Vanja. Now there is you. It shows how little faith Oyun has in us, in her own {akhara}, that she would treat blackguards and exiles with such admiration.
![[Kira - Petarus and Vanja.ogg]]

#### Oyun
Oyun is my {sekhema}, my commander. I am her {dekhara}, her warrior. I defend this {akhara} as Oyun sees fit. Whether Oyun {is} fit to see what is best for this tribe... it is not for me to say.
![[Kira - Oyun.ogg]]

#### Tasuni
My mother gave Tasuni to the gods. The gods gave him back, and I thank them for it, every day. Given the choice, I would never have chosen Tasuni as my brother, but then, family is not about what you want, it is about what you need.
![[Kira - Tasuni.ogg]]

#### Deshret
Deshret lies shackled in the darkness, while I, her blood, am shackled by duty to remain here. Oyun has decreed it. Will it be you then who frees Deshret from her dishonour? Perhaps you will, perhaps you won't. Either way, it is Deshret's fate to suffer at the mercy of injustice.
![[Kira - Deshret.ogg]]

#### Deshret_2
Deshret has ascended and returned, as we all must, to the dust of Vastiri. The Red Sekhema's dishonour has passed, and for that, outsider, I will always be grateful. Yet honour lies not in {whether} an act is committed. Honour lies in {how} an act is committed. What does it say of the Maraketh when we are forbidden to attend to our own? What does it say of Oyun and her belief in her own blood, our own honour?
![[Kira - Deshret_2.ogg]]

#### Dialla
"When a woman forgets how to die, a woman forgets how to live." Deshret said that to her {dekhara} on the day she killed Titucius, Scourge of the Maraketh. {I} say this of Dialla: When a woman knows nothing of life, how can she care for the living?
![[Kira - Dialla.ogg]]

#### Dialla_2
The Gemling Queen has given of that black life of hers... for what? To wound and wake the Beast that should have been slaughtered in its sleep. Dialla's path would lead us into Cataclysm. Follow your own path from now on.
![[Kira - Dialla_2.ogg]]

#### Malachai
What cannot be understood should be feared. It is the first rule that a child learns. There is no shame in my saying this: I fear you, Witch.
![[Kira - Malachai.ogg]]

#### Malachai_2
You have slain the Nightmare for your own reasons, Shadow. It worries me that I don't know what those reasons are. It would worry me even more if {you} didn't know either.
![[Kira - Malachai_2.ogg]]

#### Malachai_3
What do we call you now? Saviour? Messiah? Just remember this, Templar. Your 'Faith' didn't kill the Nightmare. You did.
![[Kira - Malachai_3.ogg]]

#### Malachai_4
A predator is defined by its prey. Now that your prey is dead, great hunter, what will become of you?
![[Kira - Malachai_4.ogg]]

#### Malachai_5
The Beast is dead, and Wraeclast owes you its life. Is this the grand ending you were hoping for, Duelist? Yes, you must be very proud of yourself.
![[Kira - Malachai_5.ogg]]

#### Malachai_6
I've never met a man more able, more ready, to take life and crush it in his hand. Is there anything else you can do? If not, this land has something more it needs to worry about.
![[Kira - Malachai_6.ogg]]

#### Malachai_7
The Nightmare is gone and my {akhara} is free to return to the plains. We thank you, Lady of Oriath... but do not mistake our gratitude for debt.
![[Kira - Malachai_7.ogg]]
