## Korell Goya, Son of Stone Dialogue
#### KorellPrimaryDefenderStartsFightZero
So, you're the Exile. I hope you can take some heat.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellPrimaryDefenderStartsFightZero.ogg]]

#### KorellPrimaryDefenderStartsFightOne
Only a fool braves a Redblade's encampment!
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellPrimaryDefenderStartsFightOne.ogg]]

#### KorellPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwo
Lay a hand on this cargo, Exile, and you'll pull it back blackened.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwo.ogg]]

#### KorellPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThree
The Exile approaches. Burn the evidence!
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThree.ogg]]

#### KorellPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFour
Incinerating you will be as easy as snapping my fingers.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFour.ogg]]

#### KorellPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFive
Let's be civil this time. No more imprisonment. Just death and politics.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFive.ogg]]

#### KorellPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSix
There'll be no bargaining this time. Just you, silent... smoldering.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSix.ogg]]

#### KorellPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSeven
You'll not make me betray my fellows this time!
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSeven.ogg]]

#### KorellPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEight
Don't you see? Death just makes me stronger.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEight.ogg]]

#### KorellPrimaryDefenderStartsFightNine
I thought you were dead! No matter. This time, I'll cremate you!
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellPrimaryDefenderStartsFightNine.ogg]]

#### KorellPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTen
The very ground burns at my touch!
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTen.ogg]]

#### KorellPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEleven
Burn in the everlasting fires of the earth!
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEleven.ogg]]

#### KorellPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwelve
Let's see you get through my flames now, Exile.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwelve.ogg]]

#### KorellPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThirteen
Fire is not a Redblade's only skill. My sword seeks your blood.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThirteen.ogg]]

#### KorellPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFourteen
The sight of you makes my blood boil! I shall make yours boil in kind.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFourteen.ogg]]

#### KorellSafehouseLeaderIntroZero
This is no caldera-home, but you can believe I'll defend it like any Redblade warlord.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellSafehouseLeaderIntroZero.ogg]]

#### KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero
Allow me to lend my flame to this battle.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero.ogg]]

#### KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne
There will be no theft on my watch.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne.ogg]]

#### KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo
This will go quicker with fire.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo.ogg]]

#### KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree
Let's up the heat.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree.ogg]]

#### KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour
Start running now and you might just escape my flames.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour.ogg]]

#### KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive
Those that face the smoke end up finding the fire.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive.ogg]]

#### KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix
It seems your God has forsaken you, old man. Lucky for you, I have not.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix.ogg]]

#### KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven
Fight hard, Brinerot, or the Eternal One will hear of your weakness.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven.ogg]]

#### KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight
I admire you, Gravicius. Do not let me down.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight.ogg]]

#### KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine
Today we are allies, Mutewind. Do not waste this opportunity.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine.ogg]]

#### KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalTen
Solitude does not suit you, Laffrey.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalTen.ogg]]

#### KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalEleven
Together, we will annihilate you Exile, and scatter your ashes to the wind.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalEleven.ogg]]

#### KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwelve
You're an incompetent defender, and I am here to prove it.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwelve.ogg]]

#### KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirteen
I will not let you send our efforts up in smoke.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirteen.ogg]]

#### KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalFourteen
I'm here to clear this place out, present company included.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalFourteen.ogg]]

#### KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalFifteen
I will leave nothing here but scorched earth.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalFifteen.ogg]]

#### KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalSixteen
A simple burning is not sufficient for you, Brinerot. You will be incinerated.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalSixteen.ogg]]

#### KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeventeen
Your fur will make wonderful kindling, bear-man.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeventeen.ogg]]

#### KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalEighteen
Oh, Mutewind, you always knew this day would come.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalEighteen.ogg]]

#### KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalNineteen
Aisling, there are no words for the horrors I have witnessed at your hand.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalNineteen.ogg]]

#### KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwenty
Allies one day, enemies the next.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwenty.ogg]]

#### KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyOne
Burn in the fires of Redblade vengeance!
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyOne.ogg]]

#### KorellReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero
You're merely fanning my flames!
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero.ogg]]

#### KorellReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne
I'll leave you in my burning wake.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne.ogg]]

#### KorellReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo
Flames don't care. You'll burn just the same.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo.ogg]]

#### KorellReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree
More kindling for the fire.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree.ogg]]

#### KorellReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour
Gladly.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour.ogg]]

#### KorellReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive
Prayers? I don't need the Molten God's help to smite you.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive.ogg]]

#### KorellReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix
The Syndicate makes past ties irrelevant. I understand.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix.ogg]]

#### KorellReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven
Bring on your little tricks!
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven.ogg]]

#### KorellReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight
I'm going to burn you.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight.ogg]]

#### KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyTwo
I'm here to add fuel to the fire.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyTwo.ogg]]

#### KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyThree
This transport is too crucial to leave to anyone but a Redblade.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyThree.ogg]]

#### KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFour
Burn this travesty immediately!
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFour.ogg]]

#### KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFive
Let's burn this battlefield from both ends.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFive.ogg]]

#### KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySix
Vagan! Show me your fighting spirit!
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySix.ogg]]

#### KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySeven
My command over you was only ever a matter of time.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySeven.ogg]]

#### KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyEight
Put our typical relations aside, Thane, and do as I say.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyEight.ogg]]

#### KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyNine
If you so much as harm a hair on her head, Exile, the gods themselves will shudder at what I do to you!
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyNine.ogg]]

#### KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirty
Aisling, allow me to direct your deadly art.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirty.ogg]]

#### KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirtyOne
Those who wish to live are wise to follow a Redblade warlord.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirtyOne.ogg]]

#### KorellKillPlayerZero
Like I said, only a fool braves a Redblade's encampment.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellKillPlayerZero.ogg]]

#### KorellKillPlayerOne
Keep moving, there might be others!
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellKillPlayerOne.ogg]]

#### KorellKillPlayerTwo
Keep cleaning! There may be others.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellKillPlayerTwo.ogg]]

#### KorellKillPlayerThree
I will incinerate the carcass. No traces.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellKillPlayerThree.ogg]]

#### KorellEscapeZero
All who challenge a Redblade: fools.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellEscapeZero.ogg]]

#### KorellEscapeOne
Keep chasing. One day you might catch us, Exile.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellEscapeOne.ogg]]

#### KorellEscapeTwo
You'll have to be quicker than that.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellEscapeTwo.ogg]]

#### KorellDefeatedZero
Perhaps... I... was the fool... today...
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellDefeatedZero.ogg]]

#### KorellDefeatedOne
Some things... do not burn...
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellDefeatedOne.ogg]]

#### KorellDefeatedTwo
Up... in... smoke...
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellDefeatedTwo.ogg]]

#### KorellDefeatedThree
Extinguished...
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellDefeatedThree.ogg]]

#### KorellDefeatedFour
Don't... cage this flame... again.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellDefeatedFour.ogg]]

#### KorellDefeatedFive
Felled... by the bargainer!
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellDefeatedFive.ogg]]

#### KorellDefeatedSix
This is what I get... for betraying my fellows...
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellDefeatedSix.ogg]]

#### KorellDefeatedSeven
Extinguish me again... and I will still burn...
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellDefeatedSeven.ogg]]

#### KorellDefeatedEight
Our flames... ebb and flow, Exile.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellDefeatedEight.ogg]]

#### KorellDefeatedNine
This... was over before I even arrived. Foolish!
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellDefeatedNine.ogg]]

#### KorellDefeatedTen
Hot-headed, I made an error.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellDefeatedTen.ogg]]

#### KorellOfferBargainZero
You are brutal! My clan would have liked you, if they didn't want to throw you into the caldera. What would you have me do, murderer?
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellOfferBargainZero.ogg]]

#### KorellOfferBargainOne
The Syndicate is built on trust, and trust cannot be broken by an outsider so easily. But if you were to choose someone on the inside, I could see my way into their circle of trust, and then... well, time will tell, won't it?
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellOfferBargainOne.ogg]]

#### KorellOfferBargainTwo
Let me act as your spy. Let me be the beacon that burns bright, sending signals from the distance. There is one in particular who casts an... interesting silhouette.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellOfferBargainTwo.ogg]]

#### KorellOfferBargainThree
The structure of this organisation is as fickle as a flame. I see the patterns. I'm uniquely positioned to cause a shift in Syndicate roles. Let me live, and I'll put the right words in the right ears.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellOfferBargainThree.ogg]]

#### KorellOfferBargainFour
To have been caught in this manner... absolute humiliation. For this to happen, I must have angered the Molten One. I must make a sacrifice before I become one. Let me go. I'll return to my homeland and this - our conflict - will be done.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellOfferBargainFour.ogg]]

#### KorellOfferBargainFive
You don't want to kill me. You want intelligence about this job. Am I right? I think I am. There is no more potent a weapon against an organisation that hides in the shadows than the revealing light of knowledge.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellOfferBargainFive.ogg]]

#### KorellOfferBargainSix
I had a job to do here, and I failed it. Treasures are not given for failure, they are given for victory. And you will have them, if you will let me go.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellOfferBargainSix.ogg]]

#### KorellBargainAcceptedZero
Wise choice.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellBargainAcceptedZero.ogg]]

#### KorellBargainAcceptedOne
Let us see what the light reveals...
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellBargainAcceptedOne.ogg]]

#### KorellBargainAcceptedTwo
Consider it done.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellBargainAcceptedTwo.ogg]]

#### KorellBargainAcceptedThree
The flames will serve as penance.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellBargainAcceptedThree.ogg]]

#### KorellBargainAcceptedFour
Good. Now listen closely.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellBargainAcceptedFour.ogg]]

#### KorellBargainAcceptedFive
Remember, even steel may melt...
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellBargainAcceptedFive.ogg]]

#### KorellOfferBetrayalZero
Heat rises. Yet here I am, burning with passion, serving a leader whose failures are evident. But I need only light a fuse within the Syndicate to bring them tumbling down.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellOfferBetrayalZero.ogg]]

#### KorellOfferBetrayalOne
Ranks must be earned, and, by losing, my fellow soldiers here have failed to earn theirs. With the right move, you and I could have all these members demoted by the Syndicate. It could serve your plans.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellOfferBetrayalOne.ogg]]

#### KorellOfferBetrayalTwo
You and I could cooperate to remove one of these members from the Syndicate altogether. It's only possible because of a precarious political... situation, so the offer won't last forever. What do you think? It's not too different than burning a man at the stake.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellOfferBetrayalTwo.ogg]]

#### KorellOfferBetrayalThree
I am not above ratting on my fellows to stay alive... at least today.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellOfferBetrayalThree.ogg]]

#### KorellOfferBetrayalFour
Haku plays politics... poorly. For his own sake, I must betray him, lest he make greater enemies.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellOfferBetrayalFour.ogg]]

#### KorellOfferBetrayalFive
I'm no threat to you, but Leo needs a bit of knocking down.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellOfferBetrayalFive.ogg]]

#### KorellOfferBetrayalSix
Guff's a cheat and a thief, like any Brinerot. Let me live, so that I may be a thorn in his side.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellOfferBetrayalSix.ogg]]

#### KorellOfferBetrayalSeven
Jorgin's a Thane from a distant island. We know what he did to his brother. A crime of the highest order. If he did it in my home, he'd have been fed to the mountain. I'd settle for something simpler here.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellOfferBetrayalSeven.ogg]]

#### KorellOfferBetrayalEight
I do not want to do this, but I'll betray her for you if you let me continue my plans unhindered.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellOfferBetrayalEight.ogg]]

#### KorellOfferBetrayalNine
Not a Redblade, not my problem. Let's talk.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellOfferBetrayalNine.ogg]]

#### KorellOfferExecuteZero
Like the phoenix, I will rise once more.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellOfferExecuteZero.ogg]]

#### KorellOfferExecuteOne
In front of my warlord, I'll die bravely.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellOfferExecuteOne.ogg]]

#### KorellOfferExecuteTwo
Burn boldly, friends. Let us act as beacons.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellOfferExecuteTwo.ogg]]

#### KorellOfferExecuteThree
No more prison. That's a coward's option. You'll have to slay me.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellOfferExecuteThree.ogg]]

#### KorellReplyToBetrayalAcceptedZero
I will enjoy watching your skin blister beneath my hands.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellReplyToBetrayalAcceptedZero.ogg]]

#### KorellReplyToBetrayalAcceptedOne
Your bitingly cold Way will vanish under my Redblade flames.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellReplyToBetrayalAcceptedOne.ogg]]

#### KorellReplyToBetrayalAcceptedTwo
'Can't never trust a Redblade,' but Guff, you're the one betraying.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellReplyToBetrayalAcceptedTwo.ogg]]

#### KorellReplyToBetrayalAcceptedThree
You could have been so much more, Thane.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellReplyToBetrayalAcceptedThree.ogg]]

#### KorellReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFour
I expected no loyalty, but it still stings.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFour.ogg]]

#### KorellReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFive
I always expected you to betray me, Riker.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFive.ogg]]

#### KorellReplyToBetrayalAcceptedSix
I'll burn loyalty into you yet.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellReplyToBetrayalAcceptedSix.ogg]]

#### KorellInterrogatedZero
I won't tell you a single word!
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellInterrogatedZero.ogg]]

#### KorellInterrogatedOne
You cannot... it's inhumane... inhumane!
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellInterrogatedOne.ogg]]

#### KorellInterrogatedTwo
You'd have been better off bargaining with me again.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellInterrogatedTwo.ogg]]

#### KorellReplyToExecutionZero
Did you set out to become a monster, Exile, or was it an accident?
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellReplyToExecutionZero.ogg]]

#### KorellReplyToExecutionOne
Bastard!
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellReplyToExecutionOne.ogg]]

#### KorellReplyToExecutionTwo
They'll be back, and stronger. I'll be ready.
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellReplyToExecutionTwo.ogg]]

#### KorellSafehouseLeaderDefeatedZero
The flames... they don't burn you... what manner of beast are you?
![[Korell Goya, Son of Stone - KorellSafehouseLeaderDefeatedZero.ogg]]
