## Warden of Eaves Dialogue
#### WardenWildGreeting
Approach, traveler. A good fire should be shared.
![[Warden of Eaves - WardenWildGreeting.ogg]]

#### Introduction
Keep your name your own, traveler. In this realm, we are many steps removed from the cold truths of dirt and sky. Names have power here. You may address me by what I do, rather than my name. And you... the Sacred Wisps have chosen to aid you. Curious...
![[Warden of Eaves - Introduction.ogg]]

#### Teaching
I am forbidden from teaching our ways to outsiders, especially ones that sully their spirits with virtue gems... but we have all made compromises in the battle against evil, have we not? And the Sacred Wisps do not seem to fear you. You may be worthy of the secrets of the Maji.
![[Warden of Eaves - Teaching.ogg]]

#### WardenBecomeWardenFromNone
Courage and righteousness shall be your guide.
![[Warden of Eaves - WardenBecomeWardenFromNone.ogg]]

#### WardenBecomeWardenFromPrimal
I'm glad you've decided to leave the sidelines.
![[Warden of Eaves - WardenBecomeWardenFromPrimal.ogg]]

#### WardenBecomeWardenFromBreaker
Even the darkest of hearts can be redeemed.
![[Warden of Eaves - WardenBecomeWardenFromBreaker.ogg]]

#### WardenPurchased1
The Wildwood lends its aid.
![[Warden of Eaves - WardenPurchased1.ogg]]

#### WardenPurchased2
The secrets of the forest.
![[Warden of Eaves - WardenPurchased2.ogg]]

#### WardenPurchased3
Tools against evil.
![[Warden of Eaves - WardenPurchased3.ogg]]

#### Return Later
Continue to battle against the darkness. Practice what I have taught you. When you are ready, we will train further.
![[Warden of Eaves - Return Later.ogg]]

#### Vivid Rescue
If you truly wish to become a Warden of the Maji, then you must understand that the battle against evil is never simple. We must protect the entire Wildwood, even its most fundamental denizens, and sometimes that means pruning diseased branches. Seek out afflicted treants, rescue the Vivid Wisps that they have captured. When you have completed your work, return to me, and I will teach you further.
![[Warden of Eaves - Vivid Rescue.ogg]]

#### Vivid Rescue Complete
You carry an aura of vivid energy about you. You are ready to learn more.
![[Warden of Eaves - Vivid Rescue Complete.ogg]]

#### Spiteful Winter
You have earned my trust, but the struggle against evil never ends. Among the Draíocht, there are a number of sacred trees, and some of them have become afflicted despite my best efforts. The spirits of those diseased Bíles seek to bring an untimely winter out of pure spite against their original purpose. As before, we must destroy a small afflicted part of the Wildwood to save the rest of it. Find the trio, disrupt their efforts, and then return to me. You will know them by their bone-white bark.
![[Warden of Eaves - Spiteful Winter.ogg]]

#### Spiteful Winter Complete
The Wildwood is already warming in the wake of your victory over the Bíles. You are worthy of further education in our ways.
![[Warden of Eaves - Spiteful Winter Complete.ogg]]

#### War for the Wildwood
I have been loathe to assign you this most deadly task, but now I know that you are ready. I cannot leave my post here at the border of our two realms, but I am seething to put right the injustice that saps the soul of our Wildwood. You have the strength. You have our teachings. Find the King in the Mists and deal him a lethal blow. It will not win the war outright... but it will give us time to heal the Wildwood faster than the affliction grows.
![[Warden of Eaves - War for the Wildwood.ogg]]

#### War for the Wildwood Complete
I felt it, the moment you felled the King in the Mists. The Draíocht sang of your victory. He {will} return... but not for some time, and we will have peace in the meantime. I will teach you the last of the secrets of the Maji, and you will be a bearer of our traditions. You have earned our trust.
![[Warden of Eaves - War for the Wildwood Complete.ogg]]

#### Duty
I patrol the border of the Wildwood. That is my role, to be the Warden of Eaves. I was not the first, and I will hopefully not be the last. I do my best to protect travelers who wander through, and I slay any Nameless or afflicted beasts that try to enter your realm.
![[Warden of Eaves - Duty.ogg]]

#### The Old World
I have learned much from travelers 'twixt our worlds. My people originally came from your realm, you know. Sometimes, my battles took me to the border of the other side, and I continue to marvel at the absurdities and wonders I saw. The 'sky' made me dizzy, inspired, and fearful all at once. The 'Sun' was beautiful, and I have never felt another warmth quite like it. I could do without your 'mosquitoes,' though. The Raven Trickster must have created those. The Draíocht would never have been so cruel.
![[Warden of Eaves - The Old World.ogg]]

#### The Primal Huntress
Ugh! The Breaker of Oaths, I understand. He is motivated by his morals, however misguided they may be. The Primal Huntress, on the other hand, lives without apparent meaning or purpose. We could sorely use her strength against the King in the Mists, but she refuses to aid us. What kind of woman stands by while evil overtakes her home?
![[Warden of Eaves - The Primal Huntress.ogg]]

#### The Breaker of Oaths
Let us not speak on the Breaker of Oaths. His title makes it clear what he is: a traitor. He was raised a Maji, like me, but he chose to abandon his vows and embrace forbidden and evil magics. He seeks to fell the King in the Mists, which I {can} approve of, but after that... I don't trust him. The enemy of my enemy is only my friend {for now}.
![[Warden of Eaves - The Breaker of Oaths.ogg]]

#### The Wildwood
Deep in the mists of history, the Draíocht created this forest for us, in an act fueled by our devotion. We Maji were the chosen strongest, and we were to prepare this place for the rest of our people. The Wildwood was meant to provide refuge from a winter without end, and from a land full of dangers. Unfortunately, something else came here, too from the {other} side, the unseen reflection opposite the mortal world. Shadowy creatures slipped in through a dark crack... and there is one, above all, who aggressively pursues the spread of his dark and malevolent religion. The Maji have waged a cold and bitter war against the King in the Mists for countless generations. When my parents passed, only two of us remained near the border we share with your realm... and the other of my kind broke his oath long ago. The rest of the Maji are far deeper in the Wildwood, and I know not how they fare, for I must stay at my post.
![[Warden of Eaves - The Wildwood.ogg]]

#### The Draíocht
The Draíocht was once a goddess that protected our people in your realm. There were three aspects of her, what we call the Three Sisters: the Mhacha, the Catha, and the Mórrigan. The Mhacha represented nature itself; the land, the trees, the animals, and the men and women, too. You are surrounded by her compassion at this very moment. Persuaded by the Mhacha, the Sisters Three gave of themselves, imbuing every part of nature living or not with some of their essence. The Draíocht is the result of that ultimate gift. They gave so much that nothing remained of themselves. They gave {so much}, they are all around us. Inside me, and inside you, too. I can feel their will even now, and I know that I am exactly where I need to be.
![[Warden of Eaves - The Draíocht.ogg]]

#### The Goddess
The original goddess, the one comprised by the Sisters Three, is fairly unknown now. Her name has been lost to time. I've always wondered what it was. Who she was. Her sacrifice is the only reason I exist at all. It's a sacrifice I intend to honour.
![[Warden of Eaves - The Goddess.ogg]]

#### The Catha
The second aspect of the original Goddess, the aspect known as the Catha, was the eternal battlefield betwixt good and evil. It represented the juxtaposition of summer and winter, and light and darkness. Where there is evil, there shall be good. This balance means that there is always hope.
![[Warden of Eaves - The Catha.ogg]]

#### The Mórrigan
The third aspect of the original Goddess, the aspect known as the Mórrigan, was the guiding crow, the call to battle, and the bravery in the hearts of the Maji. She flew high above our people, showing us the way. Where her wings beat, the mists parted, opening new paths toward the future.
![[Warden of Eaves - The Mórrigan.ogg]]

#### The King in the Mists
For generations, the Maji have fought against the King in the Mists. My own mother and father were slain in battle against him. We are meant to be impartial and fight selflessly against evil, but how can I possibly feel nothing? He has wounded my family in ways that can never be forgiven. One day, I {will} find a way to take his head.
![[Warden of Eaves - The King in the Mists.ogg]]

#### Cultists
The King in the Mists seeks dominion. In service of that goal, he has employed a deceitful religion. Travelers along the border are in danger, yes, but not necessarily at risk of death. Worse. He seeks their devotion. He seeks their belief. I know not what he says to them, or how he convinces them, but his ranks swell with each passing season. They are fools, all of them. Can they not feel the Draíocht all around them? Why worship a false idol?
![[Warden of Eaves - Cultists.ogg]]

#### The Incarnation of Agony
If you see her, {run}. Her wail is an omen, and her touch means certain death. She is the most evil of the Nameless, but, fortunately for us, she is quite mindless in her rage. If she were cold and calculating like the King in the Mists, we would all be doomed...
![[Warden of Eaves - The Incarnation of Agony.ogg]]

#### The Maji
We are merely the vanguard for the rest of our people, who still reside in the old world, waiting for the Wildwood to be purged of evil. We are the strongest and the brightest, chosen by the Draíocht long ago for this righteous purpose. There are many Maji deeper in this realm, though less than there were. I am the only one that ventures this close to the border 'twixt our realms.
![[Warden of Eaves - The Maji.ogg]]

#### The Nameless
I know not what they are, nor do I care. They are shadows that plague the Wildwood with disease, pain, and suffering. They must be destroyed, lest the rot spread. The Maji have fought them back since the very beginning, and we will continue to do so as long as we draw breath.
![[Warden of Eaves - The Nameless.ogg]]

#### The Affliction
The King in the Mists has brought a creeping darkness to this place, making it unsafe for travelers and denizens alike. I cannot save every wanderer, so those who find themselves here are in grave danger. The heart of evil must be ripped out if light is to return to the Wildwood.
![[Warden of Eaves - The Affliction.ogg]]

#### Tears of the Maji
The Draíocht forbid us from touching 'virtue gems'... though, it is still possible to employ them, if one is willing to blur the lines of right and wrong in the battle against evil. So long as a Maji does not touch a virtue gem, but merely places it in a geomantic socket on their armour, the pain can be endured for the sake of victory. I did see a young man directly touch a gem with his bare hand, once... I will never make that mistake myself.
![[Warden of Eaves - Tears of the Maji.ogg]]

#### Naming
Remember this, if you ever have children: name them. Bless them with that peace. It is the first thing that parents do for their children for a reason. Without a name, they are vulnerable to the changelings, at risk of being snatched away to that realm of shadows, out of jealousy and hate for those beings that are gifted with True Names... a child snatched before their naming is an opportunity for one of the Nameless to escape into being.
![[Warden of Eaves - Naming.ogg]]

#### The Seasons
I know enough of my people's past to know that Time used to work differently for us. Here in the Wildwood, we do not have your 'days' and 'nights.' We have only the seasons, a cycle that loops back on itself without marching forward. We do age, but here, what is believed and pictured has more sway than any other force. I have never known anyone who died of old age, for it is not possible to properly imagine being dead. We have nothing to fear but injury and illness... which is why the King in the Mist's affliction of disease and darkness has troubled us so. Even if he was not trying to bring through more of his kind, we would be enemies.
![[Warden of Eaves - The Seasons.ogg]]

#### The Warring Sisters
Those statues of the two sisters are somewhat misleading. They are not fighting each other. They are merely representations of battle and bravery. The Catha and the Mórrigan were two aspects of the original Goddess. It's an easy mistake to make, now that time has worn away all context.
![[Warden of Eaves - The Warring Sisters.ogg]]

#### The Raven Trickster
The Raven Trickster has few worshippers in the Wildwood. Give them no heed. He was long ago... taken care of.
![[Warden of Eaves - The Raven Trickster.ogg]]

#### Statue of the Goddess
The original Goddess is still worshiped by our ancestors in the old world. I am not surprised that you found a shrine to her here.
![[Warden of Eaves - Statue of the Goddess.ogg]]

#### Formal Greeting
Now that you are a full-fledged Warden of the Maji, I can truly meet you. My people call me Greeneyes. Greeneyes Ryann. I look forward to fighting alongside you.
