## Dannig, the Blacksmith Dialogue
#### DannigSettlersInviteToKingsmarch
You've impressed me, hero. I've sung of your exploits, to be sure, but we now find ourselves embarking on a very different adventure. The {King...} in his eternal wisdom... has seen fit to bestow a full charter upon the outpost we've been using as a home here in Wraeclast. We could greatly use your aid in building a bit of civilisation here. If you're with us, then meet me at our outpost... now called 'Kingsmarch.'

#### DannigSettlersTownIntroductiion
Welcome to our little jewel on the sea! It's not much just yet, but you've got to see it with the eyes of history! If we all do our part, this will be the start of something glorious. I'll be doing the smithing, of course, but the paperwork is out of our hands. Speak to Johan about that. As the King's Hand on Wraeclast, he handles the finances and administration. He'll put your plans into motion.
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersTownIntroductiion.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersNotMetNotBuilt
Hail. I know you can't see it now, but this little jewel on the sea will be home to a legendary forge... someday. We just need the will to create it... and the resources.
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersNotMetNotBuilt.ogg]]

#### Introduction
Welcome to the Kingsmarch forge! Here, I can smelt any ores you find into useful materials. Eventually, I may even be able to start runesmithing again. Oh, that'll be the day!
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - Introduction.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersMetNotBuilt
Can you see it, hero? This little jewel on the sea will be home to a legendary forge... someday. We just need the will to create it... and the resources.
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersMetNotBuilt.ogg]]

#### Introduction_2
There you are, hero! Welcome to the Kingsmarch forge. Here, I can smelt any ores you find into useful materials. Eventually, I may even be able to start runesmithing again. Oh, that'll be the day!
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - Introduction_2.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersOfferRunecrafting
We're ready to do more. Smelting's one thing, but runesmithing... it's an art. It can't be accomplished with any old forge. If we had the proper resources, I could create equipment the likes of which Wraeclast has never seen.
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersOfferRunecrafting.ogg]]

#### Smithing
I don't know how it's seen on Wraeclast, but smithing is something of a fine art back home. We smiths aren't priests not by a long-shot but we do study the science of runes, and the philosophies of meaning and will. That education allowed me to forge {myself} much the same way I would a sword. A man makes his own destiny. Runes are just another tool in that glorious struggle. I'm the only runesmith this side of the sea, so the best thing I can do for Kingsmarch is lend it my skills.
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - Smithing.ogg]]

#### Runes
Runes are a complex science, and a delicate art. If a smith doesn't understand their nuance, they'll only produce equipment one might call... {cursed.} For that reason, novice runesmiths are rather dangerous. There is an energy in runelight, and power in Verisium - and other metals. Runes channel those forces, like signposts... or diversions altering a river's flow. The final meaning is the sum of what you've engraved. It means exactly what you told it to mean, for better... or for worse.
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - Runes.ogg]]

#### Verisium
If you encounter any Verisium, do bring it to me. It's the most effective of all runesmithing metals. It doesn't occur naturally in the ground. It only falls from the sky. The how and the why of such events, I'll leave up to the priests and their calculations.
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - Verisium.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersIntroExpedition
I see you've found your way into the wilds. While you're out here, care to lend your skills to a matter of honour?
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersIntroExpedition.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersWildBuildReaction
It's just like we envisioned. It's no legendary forge not yet but it's a start!
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersWildBuildReaction.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersRunesmithCraft_Random
All in a day's work.
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersRunesmithCraft_Random.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersRunesmithCraft_5
Proud of that one.
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersRunesmithCraft_5.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersRunesmithCraft_9
Use that to make some legends.
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersRunesmithCraft_9.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersRunesmithCraft_13
Today's finest work.
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersRunesmithCraft_13.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersSmelting_Random
We'll break that down in no time.
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersSmelting_Random.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersSmelting_5
A hammer will make quick work of that.
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersSmelting_5.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersSmelting_9
We'll sing while we work!
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersSmelting_9.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersSmelting_13
Understood!
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersSmelting_13.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersUnlockSmithing
Oh, it'll be good to have a smithing hammer back in my hand.
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersUnlockSmithing.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersUpgradeSmeltWood
Every journey begins with a humble first step.
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersUpgradeSmeltWood.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersUpgradeWorkerSpeedOne
We're just getting into the swing of things!
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersUpgradeWorkerSpeedOne.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersUpgradeWorkerCountOne
The more the merrier!
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersUpgradeWorkerCountOne.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersUpgradeSmeltBismuth
Bismuth will be no match for our strength!
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersUpgradeSmeltBismuth.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersUpgradeWorkerCountTwo
It's always best to outnumber the enemy, even if the enemy is inanimate!
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersUpgradeWorkerCountTwo.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersUpgradeSmeltVirisium
Ah, Verisium, the most exquisite of metals.
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersUpgradeSmeltVirisium.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersUpgradeExtraOne
Ha hah!
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersUpgradeExtraOne.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersUpgradeWorkerSpeedTwo
We'll work tirelessly, day and night!
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersUpgradeWorkerSpeedTwo.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersUpgradeWorkerCountThree
It's a veritable army!
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersUpgradeWorkerCountThree.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersUpgradeExtraTwo
It's the legendary forge of Kingsmarch, just as I envisioned!
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersUpgradeExtraTwo.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersUpgradeGeneric_Random
That will certainly help.
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersUpgradeGeneric_Random.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersUpgradeGeneric_2
Starting to look like a real forge now!
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersUpgradeGeneric_2.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersUpgradeGeneric_3
This place is looking decently civilised!
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersUpgradeGeneric_3.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersUpgradeGeneric_4
Reminds me of my forge back home...
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersUpgradeGeneric_4.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersUpgradeGeneric_5
The work continues!
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersUpgradeGeneric_5.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersUpgradeGeneric_6
We'll accomplish grand things with this.
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersUpgradeGeneric_6.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersUpgradeGeneric_7
It's wondrous, how far we've come.
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersUpgradeGeneric_7.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersUpgradeGeneric_8
I couldn't ask for a grander forge.
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersUpgradeGeneric_8.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersUnlockRunecrafting
We'll forge wonders. Just you wait and see!
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersUnlockRunecrafting.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersUnlockWarRune
Ah, the War rune. It represents conflict, often in surprising ways.
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersUnlockWarRune.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersUnlockRiverRune
The River rune helps direct the flow of energies in the equipment...
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersUnlockRiverRune.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersUnlockBountyRune
The Bounty rune is one of the most cryptic to work with.
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersUnlockBountyRune.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersUnlockJourneyRune
If there's a question, or a doubt, the Journey rune is critical. It's a determinant.
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersUnlockJourneyRune.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersUnlockMountainRune
Ah, we're working with expert runes now. The Mountain can mean many things.
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersUnlockMountainRune.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersUnlockTimeRune
Onwards and upwards! Time has only one direction, and we can do naught but follow.
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersUnlockTimeRune.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersUnlockPowerRune
It's been many years since I dared smith using the Power rune. It's a symbol only for use by true artificers.
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersUnlockPowerRune.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersConvoToHimself_Random
Hmm... the runes are fickle here...
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersConvoToHimself_Random.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersConvoToHimself_2
Yes... yes, that's a plausible reason to speak to Isla...
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersConvoToHimself_2.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersConvoToHimself_3
I should have a drink with Tujen later.
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersConvoToHimself_3.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersConvoToHimself_4
I really must visit Te Onui again...
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersConvoToHimself_4.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersConvoToHimself_5
Damn useless virtue gem, doesn't do anything...
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersConvoToHimself_5.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersConvoJohanOne
Everything is going forward as sworn.
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersConvoJohanOne.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersConvoJohanTwo
{You} might not.
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersConvoJohanTwo.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersConvoTujenOne
Tujen, you've had too much to drink.
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersConvoTujenOne.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersConvoTujenTwo
Just {watch what you say.}
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersConvoTujenTwo.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersConvoRog
Rog! How goes the dream?
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersConvoRog.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersConvoIsla
Oh beautiful, just. You. Wait!
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersConvoIsla.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersOnApproachNoSmithy_Random
Hail!
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersOnApproachNoSmithy_Random.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersOnApproachNoSmithy_5
There you are.
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersOnApproachNoSmithy_5.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersOnApproachNoSmithy_8
How goes the adventure?
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersOnApproachNoSmithy_8.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersOnApproach_12
Need something smithed?
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersOnApproach_12.ogg]]

#### DannigSettlersOnApproach_16
Welcome to the forge.
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - DannigSettlersOnApproach_16.ogg]]

#### Crumpled Note
{Hark! What grace have I to live in the time of such a great beauty!} Yes... {With crimson hair unlike any in Middengard} no! No no no no no no no, too basic! The hair... the hair is nothing compared to the sparkle in her eyes, the spring in her step, the toss of her hair like a... like a stallion in the spring fields! Ohh... alright.
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - Crumpled Note.ogg]]

#### Crumpled Note_2
{Hark! What luck does this man have} terrible! Hark? Hark!? Oh...
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - Crumpled Note_2.ogg]]

#### Crumpled Note_3
{My dearest engineer, by the lamplight on your dirty face, by the stars} D'oh, where are my words when it comes to this woman?! Ugh...
![[Dannig, the Blacksmith - Crumpled Note_3.ogg]]
