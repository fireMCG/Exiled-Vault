## Renly Dialogue
#### Introduction
Where've you been, lad? I've been worried sick! I looked for you everywhere after those soldiers came for you, but when I found neither hide nor hair, I had to believe, well... It's a good thing you managed to escape the Count's 'justice', let's just say that. It seems the First Ones have graced us with fortune. We could sorely use your strength in these dark times.

![[Renly - Introduction - 2.ogg]]
![[Renly - Introduction - 3.ogg]]

#### Introduction_2
Renly's the name. You're skilled with the violence, if what you did out there in the riverbank is any sign. Another refugee from the Count's 'justice,' I take it. Well have no fear. This place is something of a hideaway for many of us now, and we could sorely use your skills in these dark times. I'll smith for you what I can, if you're willing to bend your violence toward our defence.
![[Renly - Introduction_2 - 1.ogg]]

#### The Devourer
There's a beast of particular dark power stalking us out in the Felling. It moves unseen under the dirt, and attacks without warning. We can't leave the walls to find food, and I've been unable to corner and slay the beast myself. Now if you could channel your violence against this 'Devourer,' as Finn calls it, we'd be indebted to you.
![[Renly - The Devourer - 1.ogg]]
![[Renly - The Devourer - 2.ogg]]

#### Devourer Slain
Ahh, finally! Took down the Devourer, did you? That's incredible! This is the first real success we've had against the darkness. We can breathe a bit easier now, perhaps even go out and gather food. This won't cover our debt to you, not nearly, but take it as thanks.
![[Renly - Devourer Slain - 1.ogg]]
![[Renly - Devourer Slain - 2.ogg]]

#### RenlyDevourerAdvice
There is no time for forging runes, stranger. We suffer constant attack by the Devourer.
![[Renly - RenlyDevourerAdvice.ogg]]

#### Runed Spikes
Here are your spikes but... be cautious. They stayed warm after forging no matter how many times I quenched them. I would ask what you need these for, but I'm putting my trust in you.
![[Renly - Runed Spikes - 1.ogg]]
![[Renly - Runed Spikes - 2.ogg]]

#### RenlyBitterGuyPostFight
The Count's head servant is dead? That doesn't bode well for the state of the Manor.
![[Renly - RenlyBitterGuyPostFight.ogg]]

#### RenlySiegeQuestIntro
We've been holding out for hope of rescue from the village, but many weeks have passed without word. You've shown yourself to be quite capable. Would you go to our home village and see if they require aid? If they're doing fine, which they probably are, I would appreciate you grabbing some forging materials I left behind at my smithy. We could use them for making weapons to defend Clearfell.
![[Renly - RenlySiegeQuestIntro.ogg]]

#### RenlySiegeQuestEnd
So the village has been destroyed, then. Some survivors are already finding their way here, and it looks like Clearfell is home now. We can't thank you enough for what you've done. This iron you've retrieved from my smithy... it's all I have left of the place now.
![[Renly - RenlySiegeQuestEnd.ogg]]

#### The Mad Wolf
Our village, a burning ruin... we find ourselves in the darkest of days. One stark truth is clear: Count Geonor, tasked by birthright with stewardship of Ogham, has betrayed us. Enacting ruthless laws was bad enough, but actually attacking his own people? I despise myself for this request, but I must ask you to enter the Manor and remove him from power. He has become a tyrannical madman, and if you must resort to violence... so be it.
![[Renly - The Mad Wolf - 1.ogg]]
![[Renly - The Mad Wolf - 2.ogg]]
![[Renly - The Mad Wolf - 3.ogg]]

#### Death of the Count
Count Geonor is dead. I never thought there'd come a day when such a statement brought relief. We can finally start rebuilding our poor damaged Ogham. It's going to be a long and difficult struggle, but it's not nearly the first time we Ezomytes have had to rise from the ashes.
![[Renly - Death of the Count - 1.ogg]]
![[Renly - Death of the Count - 2.ogg]]

#### Clearfell
Well this place was never meant to house this many people, especially not the sick and injured, but there's nowhere else to go. The monsters creeping out of the forest keep us locked within these wooden walls, and the Count's tyranny has made outlaws of everyone here, so nobody is coming to save us. I don't have the heart to tell the others that I don't see a way to survive this. I put on a brave face, but it's the truth.
![[Renly - Clearfell - 1.ogg]]
![[Renly - Clearfell - 2.ogg]]
![[Renly - Clearfell - 3.ogg]]

#### RenlyClearfellDevourer
With the Devourer dead, we can go out and gather food. We might actually turn things around! You've brought us hope in these dark times.
![[Renly - RenlyClearfellDevourer.ogg]]

#### RenlyClearfellVillage
This place is our new start. Clearfell Encampment was just a logging site, but now it's the seed of the Ezomyte people in Ogham. We're gon'a have to fight back the darkness and rebuild. It'll take all the strength we have, and more, but I believe we can do it.
![[Renly - RenlyClearfellVillage.ogg]]

#### Finn
I've had a few things go missing around the forge when Finn was nearby, but I can't begrudge the lad. His father refused to acknowledge him, so he was left clanless at an early age. Underneath that boastful exterior, there's just well, I'm sure it's obvious, even to strangers. His mother was a kind and honest woman. Shame he doesn't take after her.
![[Renly - Finn - 1.ogg]]
![[Renly - Finn - 2.ogg]]

#### RenlyFinnAfterQuest
I misjudged the lad. He's worth more than he knows. Now I understand what he was doing when he convinced me to flee the village instead of stand and fight. All of the sick and wounded here at Clearfell would be dead if they'd been left defenseless.
![[Renly - RenlyFinnAfterQuest.ogg]]

#### Una's Music
The girl's a shining light in a time of darkness. If it weren't for her music, I - well, I don't know what I'd do. Every time I listen to her songs, I know I have to try harder to defend this place, any fear and excuses be damned.
![[Renly - Una's Music - 1.ogg]]
![[Renly - Una's Music - 2.ogg]]

#### RenlyLeitis
I've never met Leitis, but I knew of her. The nobles disapproved of her marrying a commoner... I can't believe how far they took that grudge. Her husband was a good man.
![[Renly - RenlyLeitis - 1.ogg]]
![[Renly - RenlyLeitis - 2.ogg]]

#### Ogham
This part of Phaaryl has been a fair home for many an Ezomyte generation. The clans didn't always get along, but we had to settle our feuds when the Eternals laid their savage boot upon us. We weren't able to take part in the Bloody Flowers Rebellion, but we had our share of conflict with them here. Their ruins run over top of ours, fighting a silent war in stone.
![[Renly - Ogham - 1.ogg]]
![[Renly - Ogham - 2.ogg]]

#### The Miller
It's a shame what happened to old Branoc. He was a kind man in life, but I can't say I'll miss the creature he became. He tried to batter his way in for five full days once he rose again. We thought we were done for, but then you came along... and I'm glad you did.
![[Renly - The Miller - 1.ogg]]
![[Renly - The Miller - 2.ogg]]

#### Fatherhood
I know I'm not your father, lad, but I've tried hard to raise you the best I can. I don't know how the Karui might have taught you, but I imagine you'd still be the man you are today. You've always had a strong will. That's what truly makes you an Ezomyte, no matter where you were born.
![[Renly - Fatherhood - 1.ogg]]
![[Renly - Fatherhood - 2.ogg]]

#### Fatherhood_2
Bad enough I have all these folk to protect. I've been worried sick about my son ever since the Count's men arrested him. I was hoping you might have seen him when you were in their custody. He's a big lad, and you can't miss him, because, well... he's not from around here. I found him washed up on the riverbanks when he was just a child, a Karui foundling, perhaps lost by some raiding party. Nobody ever came for him, though. Every day here in Clearfell, I keep my eyes on the river, hoping he'll miraculously wash up on its lonely sands just one more time...

#### Twisted Animals
A curse has befallen this land. That's what Una feels. That's what I say, too. The beasts of Ogham have been friendly to men until a shadow started oozing out of the Manor. These rabid and misshapen animals are not to blame. They've been driven mad by something we can't see, only feel in our bones. Last time I felt something like this, I was a much younger man...
![[Renly - Twisted Animals - 1.ogg]]
![[Renly - Twisted Animals - 2.ogg]]

#### The Grelwood
That place used to be a kind and warm wood. I even took you to play there when you were younger, if you remember. It's a dark well now, with no way out for most. If you go there, be on guard, and remember the skills I taught you.
![[Renly - The Grelwood - 1.ogg]]
![[Renly - The Grelwood - 2.ogg]]

#### The Grelwood_2
That place used to be a kind and warm wood. I even played there when I was young. It's a dark well now, with no way out for most. I'd go with you, but I've got people to protect here.
![[Renly - The Grelwood_2 - 1.ogg]]
![[Renly - The Grelwood_2 - 2.ogg]]

#### The Hooded One
That Hooded fellow is a strange one, but if you think he's trustworthy, then you've got my support. Let's hope you're right.
![[Renly - The Hooded One.ogg]]

#### The Hooded One_2
This 'Hooded One' is here on your honour. Don't take this as a threat, but it's your head if he turns out to be as evil as he looks.
![[Renly - The Hooded One_2.ogg]]

#### Renly's Tools
So you're going back to the village, Lad? You've probably been thinking this already, but we could do some proper smithing if you manage to bring back our tools. They should still be near the forge, right where I left them. Bring them here, and we'll set up a bench. Some honest work might do wonders to lift our spirits.
![[Renly - Renly's Tools - 1.ogg]]
![[Renly - Renly's Tools - 2.ogg]]

#### Renly's Tools_2
I heard you're heading for the village. When I fled for my life, there was no time for me to grab my smithing tools. If you do manage to reach my forge, you should find them, and bring them here. I'll set up a bench, and we can see about working on your equipment.
![[Renly - Renly's Tools_2.ogg]]

#### Tools Found
Our tools! Oh, this is wonderful, lad. Haven't felt right without a proper forge. Now I can set up a proper bench here for you.
![[Renly - Tools Found.ogg]]

#### Tools Found_2
You found my tools! Oh hoh, this is wonderful. Now I can set up a proper bench here for you.
![[Renly - Tools Found_2.ogg]]

#### Cemetery of the Eternals
Tread as heavily as you like. The Eternals stomped their graves all over ours when they had a conqueror's foothold here. Now if those graves have turned up and released their dead, take our vengeance on them. Some even say, when the night is darkest, our ancestors still fight theirs among the tombs–and I don't doubt it. A true Ezomyte never surrenders their land, not even in death.
![[Renly - Cemetery of the Eternals - 1.ogg]]
![[Renly - Cemetery of the Eternals - 2.ogg]]

#### Home
Be careful if you intend on returning to the village, lad. Those thugs Count Geonor hired are far crueler than our own soldiers. You've seen them. Each accusation is weaker than the last. When they came to my forge asking for free weapons, I refused. I'd already been looking for you for quite some time, and you were nowhere to be found, so I assumed the worst, and fled for Clearfell. I'm sorry, lad. I'm just glad you're alright.
![[Renly - Home - 1.ogg]]
![[Renly - Home - 2.ogg]]
![[Renly - Home - 3.ogg]]

#### Home_2
I have a forge back home in the village, but I don't dare return. Count Geonor hired thugs that are far crueler than the Village Guard, and those mercenaries have been arresting more and more good folk. Each accusation is weaker than the last. A few of those hard-eyed men came around my forge asking for free weapons made, and I refused. I knew their ire would soon fall upon me, so I fled, and took up temporary lodging here at Clearfell.
![[Renly - Home_2 - 1.ogg]]
![[Renly - Home_2 - 2.ogg]]
![[Renly - Home_2 - 3.ogg]]

#### The Village
The thought of our village on fire... oh, my heart feels heavy. We'll get back there someday. Reclaim our lands, rebuild. Mark my words. Part of me is angry I wasn't there to defend the place, but I know I was needed by these good folks far more. I can't imagine what would have happened if they'd been out here defenseless.
![[Renly - The Village - 1.ogg]]
![[Renly - The Village - 2.ogg]]

#### The Count
Some men do not have to earn honour. Some are simply born with it by virtue of their status. Geonor is doubly a monster for giving away what others have sought their entire lives. He was born into the role rather than being chosen by the clan, and now he has squandered that by serving himself above all others. I used to believe in him, but now I cannot even stand the thought of him.
![[Renly - The Count - 1.ogg]]
![[Renly - The Count - 2.ogg]]

#### Onwards
Go, lad. After seeing what you're capable of, I see now why the First Ones brought you here as a child. It's been my honour to raise you, but now you are your own man. Do what you must, and make it back home alive. I'll still be here when you do. I promise.
![[Renly - Onwards - 1.ogg]]
![[Renly - Onwards - 2.ogg]]

#### Onwards_2
Now that the curse on this land has been broken, we can finally start rebuilding. There are certainly survivors scattered throughout Ogham. We'll find them, and we'll start down the long hard road ahead. I thank you, friend. I understand that you're leaving to pursue the ghastly thing at the heart of all this. May the First Ones grace your hunt with success.
![[Renly - Onwards_2 - 1.ogg]]
![[Renly - Onwards_2 - 2.ogg]]
![[Renly - Onwards_2 - 3.ogg]]

#### Count Geonor
The Count's name will not be remembered in our songs. Hah! Good riddance.
![[Renly - Count Geonor.ogg]]

#### Renly_Vendor_BuyArmour_Random
Oh, that'll keep you alive!
![[Renly - Renly_Vendor_BuyArmour_Random.ogg]]

#### Renly_Vendor_BuyArmour_2
Now that'll keep you alive!
![[Renly - Renly_Vendor_BuyArmour_2.ogg]]

#### Renly_Vendor_BuyArmour_3
That'll keep you alive!
![[Renly - Renly_Vendor_BuyArmour_3.ogg]]

#### Renly_Vendor_BuyArmour_6
A fine choice.
![[Renly - Renly_Vendor_BuyArmour_6.ogg]]

#### Renly_Vendor_BuyArmour_11
That's a good one.
![[Renly - Renly_Vendor_BuyArmour_11.ogg]]

#### Renly_Vendor_BuyArmour_17
You'll survive well in that.
![[Renly - Renly_Vendor_BuyArmour_17.ogg]]

#### Renly_Vendor_BuyWeapon_Random
Oh, that'll pack a punch.
![[Renly - Renly_Vendor_BuyWeapon_Random.ogg]]

#### Renly_Vendor_BuyWeapon_3
That'll pack a punch.
![[Renly - Renly_Vendor_BuyWeapon_3.ogg]]

#### Renly_Vendor_BuyWeapon_7
One of my finest.
![[Renly - Renly_Vendor_BuyWeapon_7.ogg]]

#### Renly_Vendor_BuyWeapon_13
You've a keen eye.
![[Renly - Renly_Vendor_BuyWeapon_13.ogg]]

#### Renly_Vendor_BuyWeapon_19
That'll do some violence.
![[Renly - Renly_Vendor_BuyWeapon_19.ogg]]

#### Renly_Vendor_OpenShop_Random
Anything take your fancy?
![[Renly - Renly_Vendor_OpenShop_Random.ogg]]

#### Renly_Vendor_OpenShop_7
What would you like?
![[Renly - Renly_Vendor_OpenShop_7.ogg]]

#### Renly_Vendor_OpenShop_11
Here's what I've got.
![[Renly - Renly_Vendor_OpenShop_11.ogg]]

#### Renly_Vendor_OpenShop_15
Take a look.
![[Renly - Renly_Vendor_OpenShop_15.ogg]]

#### Renly_Vendor_Sell_Random
I'll find some use for that.
![[Renly - Renly_Vendor_Sell_Random.ogg]]

#### Renly_Vendor_Sell_7
Might make good scrap.
![[Renly - Renly_Vendor_Sell_7.ogg]]

#### Renly_Vendor_Sell_12
That'll be useful.
![[Renly - Renly_Vendor_Sell_12.ogg]]

#### Renly_Vendor_Sell_18
Deal.
![[Renly - Renly_Vendor_Sell_18.ogg]]
