#### RakiataRandomShout1
Today is a good day to be dead.
![[Rakiata - RakiataRandomShout1.ogg]]

#### First Battle
I was thirteen when an Eternal army attacked my tribe. They were in search of an ancient and powerful weapon from our myths, but we only had a single piece of it. Our chieftain was felled in his sleep. My father was as well. So, I took up his weapons, and I went about the work that needed to be done. Once they were dead, knowing that more would come if we had what they wanted, I entrusted Tasalio with our piece of that fabled spear. My tribe tried to put me in charge after that, but I refused the mantle. I just did what I thought was right, and they followed. Although... there was something to the myth of that spear's power. In the few moments I held just a piece of it, my hand was permanently scarred, as if I'd been burned by unseen and unfelt heat.
![[Rakiata - First Battle.ogg]]

#### The Way
Even in my earliest memories, I was training for battle. I do enjoy fighting, but not the way others around me did. To them, it was a savage contest of dominance and manhood. To me, there was an elegance to warfare. It had an ebb and flow, like the tide. It was a kind of dance. When they say I have an unconventional fighting style, it is because they do not realize that I am not fighting. I am dancing. I may feel the bite of an axe at any moment, so why not enjoy each sweep, and each slash? They have their Way. What I have, I call the Flow.
![[Rakiata - The Way.ogg]]

#### Tasalio
Tasalio has never spoken to me directly. I think I hear his influence in the waves, and the wind over the ocean. I found a ring on the shore one day, bearing his graven pattern. It had washed up from the ocean, and I still believe it was a gift from him. It had a great power within it, but I never used it. I didn't need to. There were no problems I could not face with my own strength and cunning.
![[Rakiata - Tasalio.ogg]]

#### Ikiaho
She's stronger than she knows. She doesn't need me to fight battles on her behalf, nor would she want me to. When I first arrived here, many of the other chieftains were hostile, and the most traditional among them outright rejected me. It was she who vouched for me. The opportunity to fight allowed me to prove myself, as I knew I could, and I have led Tasalio's warriors ever since. In Ikiaho, I could not have asked for a better friend. Sometimes, we even sneak out of here, for a glimpse at the Moon and the sea.
![[Rakiata - Ikiaho.ogg]]

#### Sneak Out
There is a forgotten passage, a narrow but lengthy crack in the earth that leads to the main well, though the dead just find themselves back here after a few minutes. Still, that few minutes on the ocean, seeing the living world again... glorious. I go up there whenever I lose my tranquility.
![[Rakiata - Sneak Out.ogg]]

#### The End of Time
You'll have to ask everyone else what they think. True followers of Tasalio do not trouble themselves with thoughts of such a far-flung future. Each day that you can recline on your {waikoama}, feel the waves beneath you, and take in the sun and the sky... that is a day to treasure. I do not have those anymore, but I console myself with the knowledge that my descendants do. Live for today, outsider. Yesterday... tomorrow... they do not exist. You are only ever here, now.
![[Rakiata - The End of Time.ogg]]

#### The Flow
There is a flow to the world, to the sea, and to battle. I could lose myself for hours in a war, just running, fighting, and hewing down my enemies. I sense that you know this joy as well. I have nothing to teach you, for you already know what makes you happy.
