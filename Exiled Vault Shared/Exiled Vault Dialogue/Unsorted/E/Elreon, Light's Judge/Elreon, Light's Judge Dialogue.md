## Elreon, Light's Judge Dialogue
#### ElreonPrimaryDefenderStartsFightZero
Well met, exile. Know that we must purify those who stand in the way of our crusade.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonPrimaryDefenderStartsFightZero.ogg]]

#### ElreonPrimaryDefenderStartsFightOne
This bastion will not fall as long as our faith remains strong.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonPrimaryDefenderStartsFightOne.ogg]]

#### ElreonPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwo
Logistics is the key to any crusade, and we'll defend it with our lives.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwo.ogg]]

#### ElreonPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThree
Behind every crusade is a bloody legacy the public never sees.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThree.ogg]]

#### ElreonPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFour
Your purification has been ordered, heretic.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFour.ogg]]

#### ElreonPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFive
I withstood your Inquisition, exile. And I am stronger for it.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFive.ogg]]

#### ElreonPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSix
I'd prefer peace if I had the choice, but I don't.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSix.ogg]]

#### ElreonPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSeven
You made me question my faith last time we met. I have found new resolve.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSeven.ogg]]

#### ElreonPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEight
It is the highest calling to die for one's crusade.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEight.ogg]]

#### ElreonPrimaryDefenderStartsFightNine
Exile, you know how this ends.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonPrimaryDefenderStartsFightNine.ogg]]

#### ElreonPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTen
Purity is mine to wield against the unworthy.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTen.ogg]]

#### ElreonPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEleven
The sacred bones of centuries of Templar are an unstoppable tide.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEleven.ogg]]

#### ElreonPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwelve
God, lend me your might to smite the wicked!
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwelve.ogg]]

#### ElreonPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThirteen
God, lend me your speed to confront the wicked!
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThirteen.ogg]]

#### ElreonPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFourteen
Purification through fire!
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFourteen.ogg]]

#### ElreonSafehouseLeaderIntroZero
This is a place of sanctuary, one which I cannot allow you to defile.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonSafehouseLeaderIntroZero.ogg]]

#### ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero
Take heart, crusader! God aids our defense!
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero.ogg]]

#### ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne
We must protect these sorely needed supplies together!
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne.ogg]]

#### ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo
A holy crusade is still a war, and war comes with necessary evils.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo.ogg]]

#### ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree
Sometimes, crusading is bloody work. Let's get it done.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree.ogg]]

#### ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour
Strength in faith, and strength in numbers.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour.ogg]]

#### ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive
I will not fail the cause!
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive.ogg]]

#### ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix
I'm here to save your sorry arse, Vagan.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix.ogg]]

#### ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven
Couldn't buy your way out of this one, could you.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven.ogg]]

#### ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight
God helps even the most nauseatingly ugly of creatures.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight.ogg]]

#### ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine
The bigger they are, the more help they need.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine.ogg]]

#### ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalTen
General Gravicius, your reinforcements are here.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalTen.ogg]]

#### ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalEleven
Worry not, crusader! Your saviour has arrived.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalEleven.ogg]]

#### ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwelve
Iniquity breeds in safety. This keep must be cleansed.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwelve.ogg]]

#### ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirteen
I'll not stand idly by and let you fail our brethren!
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirteen.ogg]]

#### ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalFourteen
Wickedness and sin. That's all I see here.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalFourteen.ogg]]

#### ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalFifteen
God has called for a purge! None of you are without sin.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalFifteen.ogg]]

#### ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalSixteen
Sorry, friend, but God's got another plan for this fight!
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalSixteen.ogg]]

#### ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeventeen
You've earned a special place in God's heart, Vorici. Let me send you there.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeventeen.ogg]]

#### ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalEighteen
You're no part of God's plan. What ghastly thing made you?
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalEighteen.ogg]]

#### ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalNineteen
You may be a fellow Templar, but your unhallowed crusade is yours alone.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalNineteen.ogg]]

#### ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwenty
One thing I learned from the Templars: never trust a man in a mask.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwenty.ogg]]

#### ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyOne
Funny thing about the crusades. They start focused, but end up consuming all.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyOne.ogg]]

#### ElreonReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero
Only a fool brings a fight to God's doorstep.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero.ogg]]

#### ElreonReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne
For the crusade, I'll defend this to the death.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne.ogg]]

#### ElreonReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo
It seems we are all sinners, here.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo.ogg]]

#### ElreonReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree
I'll smite all comers!
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree.ogg]]

#### ElreonReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour
God is everywhere, warrior. Even in you.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour.ogg]]

#### ElreonReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive
I think you've been spending too much time wearing black and sitting alone in the dark, Vorici.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive.ogg]]

#### ElreonReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix
Power is a false idol, Janus. It has led you astray.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix.ogg]]

#### ElreonReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven
Not at all. Let us see who He sides with, false Templar.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven.ogg]]

#### ElreonReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight
And in the way I shall remain!
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight.ogg]]

#### ElreonReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine
Good thing I'm in a smiting mood!
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine.ogg]]

#### ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyTwo
We shall stand impregnable.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyTwo.ogg]]

#### ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyThree
Fight with renewed vigor, crusaders!
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyThree.ogg]]

#### ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFour
We do what we must for the greater good.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFour.ogg]]

#### ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFive
Exile, you leave us no choice.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFive.ogg]]

#### ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySix
Can my God borrow you from Hinekora for this fight, honored warrior?
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySix.ogg]]

#### ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySeven
Will you answer the call, Vorici?
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySeven.ogg]]

#### ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyEight
About time your family fought in a war, rather than just fund them, Janus.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyEight.ogg]]

#### ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyNine
Crusaders take all shapes, I suppose. Can you follow orders, Hillock?
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyNine.ogg]]

#### ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirty
Great emperors have become trapped by their own machines, Riker. Take care not to make the same mistake.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirty.ogg]]

#### ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirtyOne
Let's get this crusade in shape.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirtyOne.ogg]]

#### ElreonKillPlayerZero
I told you this bastion would not fall.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonKillPlayerZero.ogg]]

#### ElreonKillPlayerOne
You should never have come here, child.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonKillPlayerOne.ogg]]

#### ElreonKillPlayerTwo
Add one more sin to the pile - and burn it.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonKillPlayerTwo.ogg]]

#### ElreonKillPlayerThree
When you see him, exile, shrink not from God.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonKillPlayerThree.ogg]]

#### ElreonEscapeZero
God's worthy are saved, but heretics are punished.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonEscapeZero.ogg]]

#### ElreonEscapeOne
I was right to have faith.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonEscapeOne.ogg]]

#### ElreonEscapeTwo
Only God knows what we have done, now.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonEscapeTwo.ogg]]

#### ElreonDefeatedZero
Agh... my faith was not strong enough...
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonDefeatedZero.ogg]]

#### ElreonDefeatedOne
Not here!
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonDefeatedOne.ogg]]

#### ElreonDefeatedTwo
Expose our sins, exile. It is what we deserve.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonDefeatedTwo.ogg]]

#### ElreonDefeatedThree
I've... failed...
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonDefeatedThree.ogg]]

#### ElreonDefeatedFour
Back... to the Inquisition...
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonDefeatedFour.ogg]]

#### ElreonDefeatedFive
We should solve this with words.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonDefeatedFive.ogg]]

#### ElreonDefeatedSix
God certainly keeps testing me.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonDefeatedSix.ogg]]

#### ElreonDefeatedSeven
To fall, perhaps to die again, but pure I remain.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonDefeatedSeven.ogg]]

#### ElreonDefeatedEight
Perhaps I deserve this vengeance.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonDefeatedEight.ogg]]

#### ElreonDefeatedNine
God's eyes are not upon us this day.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonDefeatedNine.ogg]]

#### ElreonDefeatedTen
Lord, did I err?
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonDefeatedTen.ogg]]

#### ElreonOfferBargainZero
You remind me why I left the Templars. Consider me intimidated, Exile. I'll bargain.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonOfferBargainZero.ogg]]

#### ElreonOfferBargainOne
If you wish to change minds, Exile, it is better to raise people up than cut them down. Crusades are not won and lost on the battlefield alone. If you have someone in mind, I will put them at my right hand, and expose them to new ideas.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonOfferBargainOne.ogg]]

#### ElreonOfferBargainTwo
Dominus exiled me too, you know. Thought I were too soft for Templar leadership, and that my radical ideas might turn others against him. He was right! I have a knack for bringing others 'round to my way of thinking without too much blood. Perhaps you should consider using such a talent yourself.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonOfferBargainTwo.ogg]]

#### ElreonOfferBargainThree
It's hard working for a group when you don't like their methods. Reminds me of some dark days under the Templar. I'd rather find something less grim to do. Would you consider sparing this old man's life? Never too old for a second chance.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonOfferBargainThree.ogg]]

#### ElreonOfferBargainFour
All this time, all this bloodshed, I kept telling myself that the ends justify the means. But I can't stop asking myself: what if I'm wrong? Have I damned myself? Reckon it's time I took a sabbatical. I'll retreat from all this and wait for a divine sign.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonOfferBargainFour.ogg]]

#### ElreonOfferBargainFive
If only you could see the bigger picture Exile! If only you could understand what we're trying to build! Are you in a listening mood? Stay your blade and perhaps, once you've heard what we are doing here, you will change your mind.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonOfferBargainFive.ogg]]

#### ElreonOfferBargainSix
How about some old-fashioned bribery?
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonOfferBargainSix.ogg]]

#### ElreonBargainAcceptedZero
The ranks of the faithful swell!
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonBargainAcceptedZero.ogg]]

#### ElreonBargainAcceptedOne
I'll let you know what I find out.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonBargainAcceptedOne.ogg]]

#### ElreonBargainAcceptedTwo
Consider it done!
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonBargainAcceptedTwo.ogg]]

#### ElreonBargainAcceptedThree
Go with peace, Exile. And if you see God somewhere on your journey, tell him I'm waiting to hear from him.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonBargainAcceptedThree.ogg]]

#### ElreonBargainAcceptedFour
Alright then, listen closely.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonBargainAcceptedFour.ogg]]

#### ElreonBargainAcceptedFive
Not all Templar's old tactics are without their uses here.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonBargainAcceptedFive.ogg]]

#### ElreonOfferBetrayalZero
Personally, I believe this whole thing's being mismanaged. Devotion starts at the top. If you'd like, I can leverage my supporters in the Syndicate to depose our current leader and take up the role myself.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonOfferBetrayalZero.ogg]]

#### ElreonOfferBetrayalOne
In my Templar days, men that failed as hard as these would have been demoted. I'm in a position to reimplement that policy, if it suits your interests.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonOfferBetrayalOne.ogg]]

#### ElreonOfferBetrayalTwo
Sometimes, Exile, excommunication is the right tool to send a message. I do have some sway in this organisation, and I could get someone removed from the Syndicate, if that's what you're after.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonOfferBetrayalTwo.ogg]]

#### ElreonOfferBetrayalThree
No need for an Inquisition. I'll tell you everything I know about my fellow crusaders.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonOfferBetrayalThree.ogg]]

#### ElreonOfferBetrayalFour
You can't really trust someone who worships trees and ghosts, can you?
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonOfferBetrayalFour.ogg]]

#### ElreonOfferBetrayalFive
Perandus serves no power above his own. He's no ally of mine, nor of anyone who cannot help him achieve whatever foul fantasies he has cooked up.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonOfferBetrayalFive.ogg]]

#### ElreonOfferBetrayalSix
That creature is no creation of God. Whatever power it serves, we'd do well to do what we can to stop it. Together.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonOfferBetrayalSix.ogg]]

#### ElreonOfferBetrayalSeven
I don't know what God's plan is, Exile, but I know that Gravicius is not part of it.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonOfferBetrayalSeven.ogg]]

#### ElreonOfferBetrayalEight
Maloney fills me with doubt. The worst atrocities of the Templar were ordered by men in masks. Just think about why that might be for a moment, and you'll see why he's a far bigger threat than I.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonOfferBetrayalEight.ogg]]

#### ElreonOfferBetrayalNine
God welcomes all into his arms, but I can't say the reverse is true. Some people need a little nudge.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonOfferBetrayalNine.ogg]]

#### ElreonOfferExecuteZero
I'm no traitor or trader. I choose to die for the cause.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonOfferExecuteZero.ogg]]

#### ElreonOfferExecuteOne
In front of my commander, I'll choose death every time.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonOfferExecuteOne.ogg]]

#### ElreonOfferExecuteTwo
Stay strong, crusader. This Exile can do no worse than the Syndicate.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonOfferExecuteTwo.ogg]]

#### ElreonOfferExecuteThree
This old crusader has reached his limit for Inquisitions. Just end it.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonOfferExecuteThree.ogg]]

#### ElreonReplyToBetrayalAcceptedZero
Some have less faith than others. They are to be pitied.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonReplyToBetrayalAcceptedZero.ogg]]

#### ElreonReplyToBetrayalAcceptedOne
Madness is putting one's faith in long-lost ancestors. They were human, and flawed, and they'll betray you just like you've betrayed me.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonReplyToBetrayalAcceptedOne.ogg]]

#### ElreonReplyToBetrayalAcceptedTwo
Oh assassin, how expected.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonReplyToBetrayalAcceptedTwo.ogg]]

#### ElreonReplyToBetrayalAcceptedThree
Not the first time I've been betrayed for my faith. As always, I remain resolute.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonReplyToBetrayalAcceptedThree.ogg]]

#### ElreonReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFour
Gravicius, what happened to you to make you this way?
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFour.ogg]]

#### ElreonReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFive
Shut my mouth and I'll preach by humming, fiend.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFive.ogg]]

#### ElreonReplyToBetrayalAcceptedSix
I won't judge you for this, but God will.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonReplyToBetrayalAcceptedSix.ogg]]

#### ElreonInterrogatedZero
The Templars had a habit of questioning their own, forcefully. You can't frighten me.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonInterrogatedZero.ogg]]

#### ElreonInterrogatedOne
The Inquisition never ends. I learned that a long time ago.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonInterrogatedOne.ogg]]

#### ElreonInterrogatedTwo
From diplomacy to torture. I see.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonInterrogatedTwo.ogg]]

#### ElreonReplyToExecutionZero
Your methods are brutal. God will not watch you kindly.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonReplyToExecutionZero.ogg]]

#### ElreonReplyToExecutionOne
Why do you inflict such violence?
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonReplyToExecutionOne.ogg]]

#### ElreonReplyToExecutionTwo
Even my rivals deserve better.
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonReplyToExecutionTwo.ogg]]

#### ElreonSafehouseLeaderDefeatedZero
I thought God was working through me...
![[Elreon, Light's Judge - ElreonSafehouseLeaderDefeatedZero.ogg]]
