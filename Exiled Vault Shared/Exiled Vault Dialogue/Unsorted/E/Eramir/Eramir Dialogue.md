## Eramir Dialogue
#### Introduction
I've seen many an exile come and go, into the forest or into the ground. You seem different somehow. Different good, different bad, it's hard to tell at this stage. The name is Eramir, and for now you have the benefit of my doubt.
![[Eramir - Introduction.ogg]]

#### The Azmeri
The Azmeri. The culture that descended from the Azmerian Mountains and founded the Eternal Empire, so long ago. Not that these people have any understanding of their lineage. Their history, identity... all but destroyed in the cataclysm. These Azmeri took in a disowned son of Oriath, fed me, healed me. To repay my debt, I've taken in the orphans of a dead empire.
![[Eramir - The Azmeri.ogg]]

#### Yeena
A large heart yet so little sense to go with it. Yeena dabbles in things she should not. This 'Spirit' she obsesses over. If she is not careful, she will find herself joining it.
![[Eramir - Yeena.ogg]]

#### Greust
Greust is the strong right arm of this tribe. No man hunts better, and no man could do more to protect the ones he loves.
![[Eramir - Greust.ogg]]

#### Silk
Tales and songs are Silk's meat and drink. Would have made a fine bard in the old Empire. Were a fraction of what he says true, we'd have nothing to fear from bandit nor beast with Silk among us.
![[Eramir - Silk.ogg]]

#### Helena
I have spoken with Helena, of Dominus and his expedition. It all sounds horribly plausible. Whether we can fully trust what she tells us... time will tell if her torn loyalties are to mend in our favour.
![[Eramir - Helena.ogg]]

#### Blackguards
The High Templar's Blackguards? They're here, rubbing shoulders with us mere exiles? A mystery indeed, and so near the Chamber of Sins. Whatever they want with that foul place, it won't be for the betterment of humanity.
![[Eramir - Blackguards.ogg]]

#### The Bandit Scourge
Those bandits you've encountered out there... they're the dregs of Oriath. And with any foul broth, the nastiest chunks bubble to the surface. The Lords of Larceny... Oak, Kraityn and Alira... the self-appointed monarchs of the forest. Kraityn in the East. Alira in the West. Oak in the North. And this village, this tribe... we pay their taxes. I would never venture to say that life in Wraeclast is easy, but with those three gone... well, living here might just become possible.
![[Eramir - The Bandit Scourge.ogg]]

#### The Bandit Scourge_2
Those bandits you've encountered out there... they're the dregs of Oriath. And with any foul broth, the nastiest chunks bubble to the surface. The Lords of Larceny... Oak, Kraityn and Alira... the self-appointed monarchs of the forest. Thanks to you, Alira and her thralls are nourishing the trees as we speak. Giving rather than taking for once in their misguided lives. Yet Kraityn remains in the East. Oak in the North. And this village, this tribe... we continue to pay their taxes. I would never venture to say that life in Wraeclast is easy, but with Kraityn and Oak gone... well, living here might just become possible.
![[Eramir - The Bandit Scourge_2.ogg]]

#### The Bandit Scourge_3
Those bandits you've encountered out there... they're the dregs of Oriath. And with any foul broth, the nastiest chunks bubble to the surface. The Lords of Larceny... Oak, Kraityn and Alira... the self-appointed monarchs of the forest. Thanks to you, Kraityn and his river rats are food for gulls and eels. Giving rather than taking for once in their misguided lives. Yet Alira remains in the West. Oak in the North. And this village, this tribe... we continue to pay their taxes. I would never venture to say that life in Wraeclast is easy, but with Alira and Oak gone... well, living here might just become possible.
![[Eramir - The Bandit Scourge_3.ogg]]

#### The Bandit Scourge_4
Those bandits you've encountered out there... they're the dregs of Oriath. And with any foul broth, the nastiest chunks bubble to the surface. The Lords of Larceny... Oak, Kraityn and Alira... the self-appointed monarchs of the forest. Thanks to you, Alira and Kraityn are no more, their brigand clans dead or scattered. Yet Oak remains in the North. And this village, this tribe... we continue to pay his taxes. I would never venture to say that life in Wraeclast is easy, but with Oak gone... well, living here might just become possible.
![[Eramir - The Bandit Scourge_4.ogg]]

#### The Bandit Scourge_5
Those bandits you've encountered out there... they're the dregs of Oriath. And with any foul broth, the nastiest chunks bubble to the surface. The Lords of Larceny... Oak, Kraityn and Alira... the self-appointed monarchs of the forest. Thanks to you, Oak and his minions are feeding the worms as we speak. Giving rather than taking for once in their misguided lives. Yet Kraityn remains in the East. Alira in the West. And this village, this tribe... we continue to pay their taxes. I would never venture to say that life in Wraeclast is easy, but with Kraityn and Alira gone... well, living here might just become possible.
![[Eramir - The Bandit Scourge_5.ogg]]

#### The Bandit Scourge_6
Those bandits you've encountered out there... they're the dregs of Oriath. And with any foul broth, the nastiest chunks bubble to the surface. The Lords of Larceny... Oak, Kraityn and Alira... the self-appointed monarchs of the forest. Thanks to you, Oak and Kraityn are no more, their brigand clans dead or scattered. Yet Alira remains in the West. And this village, this tribe... we continue to pay her taxes. I would never venture to say that life in Wraeclast is easy, but with Alira gone... well, living here might just become possible.
![[Eramir - The Bandit Scourge_6.ogg]]

#### The Bandit Scourge_7
Those bandits you've encountered out there... they're the dregs of Oriath. And with any foul broth, the nastiest chunks bubble to the surface. The Lords of Larceny... Oak, Kraityn and Alira... the self-appointed monarchs of the forest. Thanks to you, Alira and Oak are no more, their brigand clans dead or scattered. Yet Kraityn remains in the East. And this village, this tribe... we continue to pay his taxes. I would never venture to say that life in Wraeclast is easy, but with Kraityn gone... well, living here might just become possible.
![[Eramir - The Bandit Scourge_7.ogg]]

#### Bandit Lords
There's greatness in you. You've proved that without a doubt. And whether you've destroyed the bandits for us, or for your own ends, it matters not at all. You've given us back our home, and our future.
![[Eramir - Bandit Lords.ogg]]

#### Bandit Amulets
You say the Lords of Larceny wore these around their necks? These artefacts, and that ancient gateway to the northwest... crafted by the same hands, I'd venture. Vaal hands. And it appears the brigands' trinkets could form a single whole. Give me a moment with them. I used to be good at this sort of thing. Now, this one seems to fit neatly against here, and this third one, well it looks like it...
![[Eramir - Bandit Amulets.ogg]]

#### Bandit Amulets_2
I'm so sorry, my friend. Are you well? Yes, you are apparently intact. Remarkable considering... for the barest moment there you were something altogether different. I'm not afraid to admit it... a rather unnerving version of yourself. If I were you I'd dispense with that artefact down the deepest, darkest hole that I could find.
![[Eramir - Bandit Amulets_2.ogg]]

#### Oak
The giant is no more? I wish I could say that this bodes well for us, but with Oak gone, Kraityn and Alira will only grow stronger.
![[Eramir - Oak.ogg]]

#### Alira
The sorceress is no more? I wish I could say that this bodes well for us, but with Alira gone, Kraityn and Oak will only grow stronger.
![[Eramir - Alira.ogg]]

#### Kraityn
The scarred one is no more? I wish I could say that this bodes well for us, but with Kraityn gone, Oak and Alira will only grow stronger.
![[Eramir - Kraityn.ogg]]

#### Oak_2
You have done what none of us could, not even the fierce Greust. And while we are grateful, we dare not sleep with both eyes shut just yet. The balance of power has gone. In overthrowing a Lord and a Lady, you have created a despot in Oak.
![[Eramir - Oak_2.ogg]]

#### Alira_2
You have done what none of us could, not even the fierce Greust. And while we are grateful, we dare not sleep with both eyes shut just yet. The balance of power has gone. In overthrowing two Lords, you have created an empress in Alira.
![[Eramir - Alira_2.ogg]]

#### Kraityn_2
You have done what none of us could, not even the fierce Greust. And while we are grateful, we dare not sleep with both eyes shut just yet. The balance of power has gone. In overthrowing a Lord and a Lady, you have created a tyrant in Kraityn.
![[Eramir - Kraityn_2.ogg]]

#### The Darkness
You disappear into that Vaal ruin and now the sky, the light, the very land limps as a leper. Somehow, whether through deliberate act or accident, you've caused this. Now we all suffer your consequences. Different good, different bad... we now know upon which side the coin has fallen.
![[Eramir - The Darkness.ogg]]

#### The Light
Humanity has one redeeming trait. We learn from our mistakes. You certainly gave us a scare for a bit there, but the damage doesn't seem to have been lasting. Thank you, for doing the right thing.
![[Eramir - The Light.ogg]]

#### The Baleful Gem
Show me this gem from the Chamber of Sins. It has the aspect of a Virtue Gem, like those you carry already... yet it's clearly not made to slot into any of your standard equipment. Look at the colour. Feel the energy coming off it. Maligaro had little virtue in mind when he made this thing.
![[Eramir - The Baleful Gem.ogg]]

#### Maligaro's Spike
Could be the nasty piece of work Silk picked up near the Chamber of Sins. Looks too much like Maligaro's dark science to me. If you can talk Silk into giving it to you, do history a favour, and sink that spike to the bottom of the river.
![[Eramir - Maligaro's Spike.ogg]]

#### Maligaro's Creations
The Baleful Gem and Maligaro's Spike. I'd wager these two grotesqueries were made for each other. A marriage born in darkness. My advice? Send them to their wedding bed: the river bed.
![[Eramir - Maligaro's Creations.ogg]]

#### Ancient Gateway
That ancient gateway to the northwest, it's a peculiar thing. Not of the Eternal Empire. It could be Vaal in origin... a culture I've seen mentioned here and there in some of the most antique of texts. It is the Vaal who began the use of Virtue Gems, well before our imperial ancestors. Little else is known about them. If only I had my old museum archives, I could have given you a more tempered theory.
![[Eramir - Ancient Gateway.ogg]]

#### Lorrata
You've put an end to old Lorrata? Twisted of heart and mind were the men who made that gem and that implement of black surgery. And what of the one who chooses to wield their creations? Of course I wished to know the secrets locked in that tomb. But not at the cost of such a grand, old life.
![[Eramir - Lorrata.ogg]]

#### Fellshrine Ruins
The Fellshrine is a shadow of what was once good in Wraeclast. That sigil etched into its stones? It's a Descry, from when the Templar truly stood for something. To the ancestors of Oriath, the Descry was a flickering torch in the night. A source of inspiration and comfort. Sad thing about torches... they go out.
![[Eramir - Fellshrine Ruins.ogg]]

#### The Dark Altar
So this altar you've found... it's a small pyramid, missing its apex? Must be Vaal in origin. And there's only one artefact that I've ever laid eyes on that could be the missing apex. Alira, Kraityn and Oak... they stayed with us for a short time, while recovering from the ordeals of the Siren Coast. Thick as thieves they were, until they discovered something: a small pyramid crafted in a Vaalish style. It had the power to enhance one's innate strengths. They fought over it, sundered the apex in trine... took a piece each, and fled. If you're determined to unlock that altar, then I think your key lies with the Lords of Larceny.
![[Eramir - The Dark Altar.ogg]]

#### Yeena's Vision
For all of her strange ways, I've learned not to discount Yeena's more vivid dreams. She's in tune with this land in ways I find difficult to comprehend. As to this 'man-crafted' mountain she describes, I have seen only one structure of its like. Stumbled across sketches in the Theopolis archives, a piece of Vaal engineering, pyramidal in architecture. According to those documents the pyramid lies north of the Phrecian Forest, buried beneath the mantle upon which Sarn rests. I have no idea whether it still exists, or ever existed for that matter. Still, considering the current circumstances, there isn't much to lose in the search, is there?
![[Eramir - Yeena's Vision.ogg]]

#### Blocked Passage
I've read about Shavronne of Umbra, and what she did to the Warden at Axiom. You did well to end Brutus' sorry existence. But Shavronne's barricade, that's sad news indeed. There is little enough freedom in Wraeclast as it is, but to be stranded on that dismal coast... I pity the exiles to come. Would I know how to lower the barricade? Afraid not. I was a bit distracted the last time I took the pass. Hungry goatmen to avoid on that side, Alira's thralls on this side.
![[Eramir - Blocked Passage.ogg]]

#### The Chamber of Sins
The Chamber of Sins? Apparently the late Archbishop Geofri of Phrecia gave it that title. It was built by Emperor Chitus for one Inquisitor Maligaro. How do I know this? To my shame, I did Dominus' dirty work in the selfish hopes of scholarly advancement. I scoured fragments of documents brought back by Fairgraves - and Daresso, before his disgrace. I unearthed all I could on the Eternal Empire's masters and mistresses of thaumaturgy, a subject of keen interest to our supposedly devout High Templar. If I were you, I'd avoid Maligaro's old laboratory. A place of illness infected by a diseased mind.
![[Eramir - The Chamber of Sins.ogg]]

#### Dominus
I embraced the patronage that High Templar Dominus offered my struggling museum. I took his favour and conducted his research into the thaumaturgical arts practiced within the Eternal Empire. I wish I'd known then what I know now. That I was pandering to the warped dreams of a madman.
![[Eramir - Dominus.ogg]]

#### Greetings
Ah yes, you do seem to have a penchant for presenting yourself when times are at their most... perplexing. It would seem that our Almighty has forsaken us. False deities from ages past now rise and ravage while our blessed Innocence remains as silent as the stones at my feet. So much for Templar propaganda, eh? Well, I suppose if we are to fend for ourselves, then I should answer your troubling arrival with our own most pressing tribulation.
![[Eramir - Greetings.ogg]]

#### Ralakesh
Yes, Ralakesh, the god of many faces. I read about this god when I looked after the museum in Theopolis. It's said he was obsessed with governance, in particular, the control of humanity through our base, animal instincts. He ruled over the citizens of one unfortunate Vaal city. Alas, the name escapes me. Yet I do recall that his experiments brought his subjects to the brink of extinction and that he was forced to enslave many a primitive Azmerian of the time so as to repopulate his domain. Though I shudder at the thought, I can only imagine that Ralakesh has rather similar plans now.
![[Eramir - Ralakesh.ogg]]

#### Weylam
A fascinating case that flies in the face of all that is natural. Weylam is undead for sure, something we have in spades in Wraeclast, but a sentient, reasonable ghost? Now that is rare indeed. When we talk, I feel as if I am staring into the breach, witnessing that which man was not meant to know. I have theorised about what animates the pirate's essence, how he manages to manifest on this earth once again. I think I shall compile my observations and speculations into a book. Yes... Eramir's Elucidations of Undeath. Has a nice ring to it, don't you think?
![[Eramir - Weylam.ogg]]

#### Arakaali's Temple
Unfortunately, Arakaali's temple lies beyond that which now belongs to Ralakesh. To reach the many-legged goddess you must first draw to some conclusion with the many-faced god.
![[Eramir - Arakaali's Temple.ogg]]

#### Arakaali
From what I can recall, Arakaali was a Vaal fertility goddess, a rather unsettling union of sexuality and mortality. Whilst usually presenting herself as a large arachnid, Arakaali would often assume human form, a ruse intended to lure mortals into the act of copulation. The entries were vague about the gender of her prey. After satiating her carnal desires, she would then quench her divine thirst, draining her erstwhile lover of all bodily fluid. Her acolytes would then collect the dessicated husk and give it a decorative placement in Arakaali's unholy temple. I fear that Silk knows not the true nature of the 'marriage' he so desperately seeks.
![[Eramir - Arakaali.ogg]]

#### The Vaal City
While they were highly advanced in their technology, the Vaal were rather brutish in their social practices. I find it rather baffling to think of the Vaal as a people who believed in science and progress and yet constructed elaborate sacrificial altars in the centers of their cities. Judging by the construction of this particular ruin, I would say that the city rose to prominence during the reign of Queen Tetzlapokal who some scholars refer to as a 'waif of disturbing proclivities'. She was a devotee of Arakaali and according to the literature, had a deep fascination with mortality and the inert human form. The histories tell how the queen would request her subjects to deposit the bodies of their deceased loved ones upon the steps of her palace. The corpses would be promptly taken inside to be used for... unfortunately most scholars fell into hysterical conjecture at that point. At least I hope it was conjecture.
![[Eramir - The Vaal City.ogg]]

#### Greust_2
The relic that washed ashore and started all the chaos, it was covered in ancient Vaal inscriptions. The symbols were much weathered, making them challenging to translate, yet I did my best. The inscriptions spoke of the god, Ralakesh. If this object somehow housed the spirit of that many faced monstrosity, then I fear we are all in danger. Ralakesh was renowned for his penchant for subjugation and control. Please, I urge you to destroy this god before his strength and dominance grow insurmountable. Nip this divine threat in the bud, as it were. Our poor friend, Greust, has likely become Ralakesh's avatar in this world. At least his recent behaviour would indicate as much. If you could see to Greust's... passing... Ralakesh will be forced to retreat into the relic. Destroy the relic and perhaps you will also destroy the god.
![[Eramir - Greust_2.ogg]]

#### EramirRalakeshQuestOak
The relic that washed ashore and started all the chaos, it was covered in ancient Vaal inscriptions. The symbols were much weathered, making them challenging to translate, yet I did my best. The inscriptions spoke of the the god, Ralakesh. If this object somehow housed the spirit of that many faced monstrosity, then I fear we are all in danger. Ralakesh was renowned for his penchant for subjugation and control. Please, I urge you to destroy this god before his strength and dominance grow insurmountable. Nip this divine threat in the bud, as it were. Now, it would seem that Oak has been unfortunate enough to become Ralakesh's manifest avatar in this world. At least his recent appearance and behaviour would suggest as much. If you could see to Oak's untimely passing, Ralakesh will be forced to retreat into the relic. Destroy the relic and perhaps you will also destroy the god.
![[Eramir - EramirRalakeshQuestOak.ogg]]

#### EramirRalakeshQuestKraityn
The relic that washed ashore and started all the chaos, it was covered in ancient Vaal inscriptions. The symbols were much weathered, making them challenging to translate, yet I did my best. The inscriptions spoke of the the god, Ralakesh. If this object somehow housed the spirit of that many faced monstrosity, then I fear we are all in danger. Ralakesh was renowned for his penchant for subjugation and control. Please, I urge you to destroy this god before his strength and dominance grow insurmountable. Nip this divine threat in the bud, as it were. Now, it would seem that Kraityn has earned his comeuppance in the form of divine possession by Ralakesh. At least his recent appearance and behaviour would suggest as much. If you could see to Kraityn's merciful demise, Ralakesh will be forced to retreat into the relic. Destroy the relic and perhaps you will also destroy the god.
![[Eramir - EramirRalakeshQuestKraityn.ogg]]

#### EramirRalakeshQuestAlira
The relic that washed ashore and started all the chaos, it was covered in ancient Vaal inscriptions. The symbols were much weathered, making them challenging to translate, yet I did my best. The inscriptions spoke of the the god, Ralakesh. If this object somehow housed the spirit of that many faced monstrosity, then I fear we are all in danger. Ralakesh was renowned for his penchant for subjugation and control. Please, I urge you to destroy this god before his strength and dominance grow insurmountable. Nip this divine threat in the bud, as it were. Now, it would seem that Alira has found herself rather consumed by Ralakesh's divine ego. At least her recent appearance and behaviour would suggest as much. If you could see to Alira's corporeal conclusion, Ralakesh will be forced to retreat into the relic. Destroy the relic and perhaps you will also destroy the god.
![[Eramir - EramirRalakeshQuestAlira.ogg]]

#### Ralakesh_2
You truly are a hero of the modern age, succeeding where even the ancient Vaal could not! I must say, I'm really quite relieved. For a while there I feared we were headed towards another theocratic dictatorship. Exile allowed me to be free of one. I had no wish to experience another. You deserve to be rewarded for your efforts. Here, something with a little insight would suit your purposes nicely.
![[Eramir - Ralakesh_2.ogg]]

#### Gruthkul
Yes, I know of Gruthkul, the grieving mother. She featured quite prominently in some of the Vaal texts I restored during my time at the museum in Theopolis. After the deaths of her children, Queen Gruthkul fled north, eventually finding respite amongst the refugee of her own shattered realm. Yet these loyalists saw their own queen as a weapon, a tool for vengeance. They nurtured her pain, transfiguring sorrow into hatred, hatred into violence. Like a grizzled bear, Gruthkul descended into animalism and ferocity. Yet her caretakers foolishly underestimated the agony their bereaved queen harboured in her heart. Like a bear caught in a trap, Gruthkul wrenched free of her human loyalties and slew her followers to the last woman and child. It was through devastation Gruthkul ascended to divinity. Gruthkul's pain has transcended ages and she will vent that pain upon any and all she encounters until her grief is finally laid to rest.
![[Eramir - Gruthkul.ogg]]

#### Gruthkul_2
So the grieving mother sleeps once more. Her story has come to fascinate me, and your conquest of her makes for a satisfying dramatic climax, don't you think? I'm but an old man, living vicariously through your life. As history seems intent on repeating itself, I shall record it in a book, "A Historical Account Of The Goddess Gruthkul And The Legendary Champion Who Defeated Her." Yes, the title needs a bit of work, but it will suffice for now. Here, consider this offering as an advance on the royalties we shall reap post-publication... that is, if there is anyone in Wraeclast who can read.
![[Eramir - Gruthkul_2.ogg]]

#### Silk_2
It started with a few mumblings in his slumber, then long forays into the wilds, searching for relics of a distinctly arachnid nature. I thought it a natural extension of Silk's eccentric persona at first. Then came the sleepless nights studying those relics, the fevered recitations in broken Vaalish, the strange eight phase rituals... Then one night Silk gathered his collection and scuttled off into the darkness without a word. Silk has always been susceptible to fine fictions. Perhaps he has finally shunned reality altogether.
![[Eramir - Silk_2.ogg]]

#### Silk_3
What? He's intending to make matrimony with Arakaali? My word, that's quite a story even for Silk! Yes, I know that name, and the place to which it is purportedly attached. A temple to the north, now in ruins. If Silk intends unholy congress with this Arakaali, that is the most likely place we would seek it.
![[Eramir - Silk_3.ogg]]

#### Silk_4
Poor Silk. Like so many before him, Silk succumbed to a most insidious disease. Ambition. That craving for greatness. An irresistible compulsion to leave one's mark on the world. There's another name for marks like that. Scars.
![[Eramir - Silk_4.ogg]]
