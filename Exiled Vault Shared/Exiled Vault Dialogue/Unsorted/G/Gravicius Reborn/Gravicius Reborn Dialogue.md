## Gravicius Reborn Dialogue
#### GraviciusIntro1
I shall purify you in flame, whore of nightmare!
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusIntro1.ogg]]

#### GraviciusIntro2
You've forgotten your place, Karui slave. Let me remind you.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusIntro2.ogg]]

#### GraviciusIntro3
You're God's greatest disappointment, heretic!
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusIntro3.ogg]]

#### GraviciusIntro4
You're not the only one who wields death as a weapon, boy!
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusIntro4.ogg]]

#### GraviciusIntro7
God gave this world to Man, not to you, little girl!
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusIntro7.ogg]]

#### GraviciusIntro6
Give up the fight, Duelist! Your soul was lost long ago!
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusIntro6.ogg]]

#### GraviciusDeathRandom
I fought for God. Who do you fight for, exile?
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusDeathRandom.ogg]]

#### GraviciusDeath3
My place is at God's side. Where will your journey end, exile?
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusDeath3.ogg]]

#### The Game
There is no turning back now. The Trial has begun, and death waits for no one. Descend into the depths and conquer the demons within, and your valiant efforts will be immortalised in the hearts and minds of our patrons. But only the worthy will return alive and triumphant. God be with you, brave challenger.

#### GraviciusDescent2Aggro
Incurable fool! You will not be the one to complete this Trial!

#### GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightZero
I serve a new God now, Exile.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightZero.ogg]]

#### GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightOne
Man the defenses! Bring me the Exile's head!
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightOne.ogg]]

#### GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwo
You dare desecrate these sacred grounds?
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwo.ogg]]

#### GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThree
God tests our mettle! Protect the cargo!
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThree.ogg]]

#### GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFour
Had you been a little earlier, you would have made a fine subject for these experiments.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFour.ogg]]

#### GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFive
God's judgement awaits you!
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFive.ogg]]

#### GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSix
No prison can hold a true servant of God.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSix.ogg]]

#### GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSeven
Ah, the bargainer! Let steel taste blood once more.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSeven.ogg]]

#### GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEight
Perhaps we'll politick again, Exile, if you survive!
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEight.ogg]]

#### GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightNine
A true servant of God can never be defeated. Your efforts are futile.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightNine.ogg]]

#### GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTen
I slew you, yet you return! I wonder how many times I'll get to kill you?
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTen.ogg]]

#### GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEleven
God's might is granted to a chosen few. Witness!
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEleven.ogg]]

#### GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwelve
My legions are immortal.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwelve.ogg]]

#### GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThirteen
I will crush you!
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThirteen.ogg]]

#### GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFourteen
Charge into the fray!
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFourteen.ogg]]

#### GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFifteen
I shall purify you in the flame of God's wrath!
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFifteen.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSafehouseLeaderIntroZero
You dare foul this sanctuary? To the death!
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusSafehouseLeaderIntroZero.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero
These grounds will not be defiled!
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne
Do your work. Protect the cargo!
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo
The work of the chosen must not be delayed.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree
God's judgement is swift and final.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour
Worry not Exile, your doom is certain!
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive
Time for me to clean up yet another of your messes, Karui.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix
The crusade never ends, brother. Allow me to aid you.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven
Protect the noble bloodline!
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight
Cameria, remember your lessons.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine
My new God appreciates your cruelty. I offer aid.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTen
Time for me to clean up yet another of your messes.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTen.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalEleven
This sanctuary will not fall as long as I remain standing.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalEleven.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwelve
Walls under the command of a fool are no more than sand shaped by a child.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwelve.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirteen
If the Syndicate wanted this cargo stolen, they certainly chose their defender well.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirteen.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalFourteen
The best way to take down multiple enemies is to strike when they are fighting each other!
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalFourteen.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalFifteen
This victory shall be mine.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalFifteen.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalSixteen
I shall put you in your place, Karui.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalSixteen.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeventeen
Can you feel God's disappointment in you, heretic?
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeventeen.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalEighteen
This world was made to be bent to Man's will. As were you, little girl!
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalEighteen.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalNineteen
You think death is your weapon alone, boy, but you are dearly mistaken.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalNineteen.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwenty
I wish you had listened, Cameria.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwenty.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyOne
You've had your chance. Now a real leader must step in.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyOne.ogg]]

#### GraviciusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero
Luckily I have the skill to destroy all comers!
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero.ogg]]

#### GraviciusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne
This cargo will not be yours, traitor!
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne.ogg]]

#### GraviciusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo
Careful, traitor, lest you end up a test subject at our next lab.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo.ogg]]

#### GraviciusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree
Just more souls to deliver to God!
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree.ogg]]

#### GraviciusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour
I think not.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour.ogg]]

#### GraviciusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive
God becomes what we want him to be, and thus we can do no wrong in his name.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive.ogg]]

#### GraviciusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix
Mercy is not in me, assassin. Neither given, nor receivable.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix.ogg]]

#### GraviciusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven
I know full well the golden blood of your line of traitors!
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven.ogg]]

#### GraviciusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight
Sentari was a fool. If I had been there, the Ezomytes would have been cut down to the last man.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight.ogg]]

#### GraviciusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine
Disappointing, but not unexpected. Let my final lesson begin!
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine.ogg]]

#### GraviciusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalTen
Be quiet.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalTen.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyTwo
Now we cannot fail!
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyTwo.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyThree
This cargo will not be yours, Exile!
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyThree.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFour
You'll never succeed now, Exile.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFour.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFive
You are doomed now, Exile!
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFive.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySix
And so you find yourself in your destined role, Karui: under my command!
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySix.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySeven
God promised immortality, Elreon, but the Eternal One delivered. This is my crusade now.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySeven.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyEight
You were born a weapon, Hillock, and I will wield you on behalf of the Syndicate.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyEight.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyNine
It is good that you believe 'might makes right,' Thane. That means we agree I should be in charge here.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyNine.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirty
Bend your carving to the will of warfare, Aisling.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirty.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirtyOne
This is my crusade to lead now.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirtyOne.ogg]]

#### GraviciusKillPlayerZero
You will never achieve victory fighting only for yourself.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusKillPlayerZero.ogg]]

#### GraviciusKillPlayerOne
Secure the cargo, and make sure that one is fully dead.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusKillPlayerOne.ogg]]

#### GraviciusKillPlayerTwo
Pile this carcass with the others.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusKillPlayerTwo.ogg]]

#### GraviciusKillPlayerThree
You brought this on yourself.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusKillPlayerThree.ogg]]

#### GraviciusEscapeZero
God's plan continues apace. Until next time, Exile.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusEscapeZero.ogg]]

#### GraviciusEscapeOne
There shall be no prize for you this day.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusEscapeOne.ogg]]

#### GraviciusEscapeTwo
A pity, Exile. You were so close.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusEscapeTwo.ogg]]

#### GraviciusDefeatedZero
Is no defense enough?
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusDefeatedZero.ogg]]

#### GraviciusDefeatedOne
You brute!
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusDefeatedOne.ogg]]

#### GraviciusDefeatedTwo
You are no thing of God!
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusDefeatedTwo.ogg]]

#### GraviciusDefeatedThree
How is this possible?
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusDefeatedThree.ogg]]

#### GraviciusDefeatedFour
The flesh can be bound and shackled, but faith will persevere in the end.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusDefeatedFour.ogg]]

#### GraviciusDefeatedFive
More deals, Exile?
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusDefeatedFive.ogg]]

#### GraviciusDefeatedSix
Wait, wait!
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusDefeatedSix.ogg]]

#### GraviciusDefeatedSeven
I shall die a thousand times if needed!
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusDefeatedSeven.ogg]]

#### GraviciusDefeatedEight
Turnabout is fair play.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusDefeatedEight.ogg]]

#### GraviciusDefeatedNine
I don't have to win every battle to win the war.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusDefeatedNine.ogg]]

#### GraviciusDefeatedTen
Just a small misstep on the inevitable path to salvation.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusDefeatedTen.ogg]]

#### GraviciusOfferBargainZero
You've made your show of force, savage. I submit, and entreat you to bargain in exchange for my life.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusOfferBargainZero.ogg]]

#### GraviciusOfferBargainOne
You are clearly superior. I admit defeat. Perhaps you would wrest from me a political reward? I'll bring on a fellow Syndicate member to this job at your behest. Perhaps someone weak, and easily exploitable.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusOfferBargainOne.ogg]]

#### GraviciusOfferBargainTwo
I care not who I deceive in the pursuit of my goal. The Syndicate is full of Godless heretics seeking to evade eternal judgement.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusOfferBargainTwo.ogg]]

#### GraviciusOfferBargainThree
Ah, I see your plans, Exile. You want to reorganize the Syndicate for your own reasons. Perhaps our goals align? I wish to stay alive for the moment, and you - what do you want?
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusOfferBargainThree.ogg]]

#### GraviciusOfferBargainFour
I've been blind to the Syndicate's heresy for far too long. I am done with it. My only escape from the Eternal One is to remain alive. If you kill me, I'll just rise again, deeper in the Syndicate's clutches.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusOfferBargainFour.ogg]]

#### GraviciusOfferBargainFive
Strategic knowledge is the key to warfare. Spare me this time and I'll tell you what I know.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusOfferBargainFive.ogg]]

#### GraviciusOfferBargainSix
I prefer not to rely overmuch on the Eternal One's resurrection. Debts quickly become chains. Would you accept material reward in exchange for sparing me?
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusOfferBargainSix.ogg]]

#### GraviciusBargainAcceptedZero
That serves my plans quite well.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusBargainAcceptedZero.ogg]]

#### GraviciusBargainAcceptedOne
One heathen is as good as another.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusBargainAcceptedOne.ogg]]

#### GraviciusBargainAcceptedTwo
You are a wonderful pawn, Exile.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusBargainAcceptedTwo.ogg]]

#### GraviciusBargainAcceptedThree
Solitary prayer shall guide me, in time.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusBargainAcceptedThree.ogg]]

#### GraviciusBargainAcceptedFour
Now you know what I wish you to know.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusBargainAcceptedFour.ogg]]

#### GraviciusBargainAcceptedFive
Drive the Syndicate into a corner and enrage it.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusBargainAcceptedFive.ogg]]

#### GraviciusOfferBetrayalZero
I always make sure to keep watch for an advantage over my superior officers. I know something that the Eternal One would very much like to hear about...
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusOfferBetrayalZero.ogg]]

#### GraviciusOfferBetrayalOne
You could kill me here and now, or I could spread certain rumors that would undermine the positions of my fellows.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusOfferBetrayalOne.ogg]]

#### GraviciusOfferBetrayalTwo
I don't see God after death, Exile. Not when the Eternal One brings me back. I'd prefer not to die if it can be avoided, and I have the political clout to lie to my superiors and get one of my fellows here excommunicated from the Syndicate. Care to make a deal?
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusOfferBetrayalTwo.ogg]]

#### GraviciusOfferBetrayalThree
I can't afford to die right now. I can offer knowledge in exchange. I will tell you everything I know about my fellows.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusOfferBetrayalThree.ogg]]

#### GraviciusOfferBetrayalFour
It is in my power to ruin another if you'll let me live, and I have no qualms over the fate of a Karui.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusOfferBetrayalFour.ogg]]

#### GraviciusOfferBetrayalFive
I have reason to doubt Elreon's faith, and I have long worked to gather leverage over him. Let me live, and I shall show you.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusOfferBetrayalFive.ogg]]

#### GraviciusOfferBetrayalSix
That pathetic excuse for a man is not worthy of the Perandus name. You and I must betray him before he turns on us.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusOfferBetrayalSix.ogg]]

#### GraviciusOfferBetrayalSeven
That thing is no creation of God, Man, or Beast. Let me live, and we can both work against it.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusOfferBetrayalSeven.ogg]]

#### GraviciusOfferBetrayalEight
You would do wise not to kill me. Cameria is just like me, but without refinement. He is a greater threat. God's plan does not include the weak or the corrupt. Let me live, and I can work against them.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusOfferBetrayalEight.ogg]]

#### GraviciusOfferExecuteZero
Death holds no terror for me, Exile. It is you who should fear.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusOfferExecuteZero.ogg]]

#### GraviciusOfferExecuteOne
For the Syndicate, I give my life!
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusOfferExecuteOne.ogg]]

#### GraviciusOfferExecuteTwo
Stay strong, comrade. This Exile can inflict no worse than death.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusOfferExecuteTwo.ogg]]

#### GraviciusOfferExecuteThree
No more prisons. You will have to slay me.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusOfferExecuteThree.ogg]]

#### GraviciusReplyToBetrayalAcceptedZero
Traitorous scum!
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusReplyToBetrayalAcceptedZero.ogg]]

#### GraviciusReplyToBetrayalAcceptedOne
I didn't think you had the nerve to risk my wrath - Haku.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusReplyToBetrayalAcceptedOne.ogg]]

#### GraviciusReplyToBetrayalAcceptedTwo
It is always a turncoat who suffers the harshest of God's punishments. I do not envy the fate that awaits you.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusReplyToBetrayalAcceptedTwo.ogg]]

#### GraviciusReplyToBetrayalAcceptedThree
Oh, Perandus, thy name is liar.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusReplyToBetrayalAcceptedThree.ogg]]

#### GraviciusReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFour
I should have expected this from an Ezomyte heretic.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFour.ogg]]

#### GraviciusReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFive
We will talk about this later.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFive.ogg]]

#### GraviciusReplyToBetrayalAcceptedSix
I will enjoy breaking you.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusReplyToBetrayalAcceptedSix.ogg]]

#### GraviciusInterrogatedZero
A true servant of God is no stranger to the Inquisition. I have nothing to hide.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusInterrogatedZero.ogg]]

#### GraviciusInterrogatedOne
I shall stand strong no matter how many times I face an Inquisition.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusInterrogatedOne.ogg]]

#### GraviciusInterrogatedTwo
No deal this time? I underestimated your resolve, Exile.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusInterrogatedTwo.ogg]]

#### GraviciusReplyToExecutionZero
Death is simply the way of this land. Get on with it, Exile.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusReplyToExecutionZero.ogg]]

#### GraviciusReplyToExecutionOne
Fool! Do not disrupt God's plan!
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusReplyToExecutionOne.ogg]]

#### GraviciusReplyToExecutionTwo
I cannot claim sorrow for that fool.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusReplyToExecutionTwo.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSafehouseLeaderDefeatedZero
Bring your Inquisition, Exile. I guarantee I've personally run far worse than your darkest imagining.
![[Gravicius Reborn - GraviciusSafehouseLeaderDefeatedZero.ogg]]
