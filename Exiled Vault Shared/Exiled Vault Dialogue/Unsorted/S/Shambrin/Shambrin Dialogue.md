## Shambrin Dialogue
#### Introduction
Who goes there? Oh, a newcomer to our caravan. I am Shambrin, tradesmith and weaponmaster for the Ardura. Do not hesitate to ask if you require anything.

![[Shambrin - Introduction - 2.ogg]]

#### Introduction_2
Who goes there? By the sound of your voice, you cannot be Maraketh. It is always intriguing to meet foreign warriors and learn their ways of war. I only hope I have weapons and armour that might be useful to you. I am Shambrin.

![[Shambrin - Introduction_2 - 2.ogg]]

#### Introduction_3
Who goes there? By the sound of your voice, you cannot be Maraketh. You may trade with me, for trade is the lifeblood of survival in the desert, but expect no kindness.

#### Rest for the Wicked
If you are traveling through Traitor's Passage, there is something I wish to ask of you. Did your {akhara} keep the tale of the Traitor, Balbala? She is still sealed there, somewhere along the tunnel as an undying Djinn. She served her sentence long ago, but knowledge of the location was lost. It is long past time to release her.

#### Rest for the Wicked_2
If you are traveling through Traitor's Passage, there is something I wish to ask of you. The Traitor, Balbala. According to the tales, she is still sealed there, somewhere along the tunnel, as an undying Djinn. She served her sentence long ago, but knowledge of the location was lost. It is long past time to release her. I will tell you her story, if you wish, but I doubt it will mean much to a {jingakh.}

#### Balbala, the Traitor
Your {akhara} did not tell this tale? It's one of my favourites. Long ago, when Keth was the shining jewel of the Vastiri and our trade routes were the envy of the known world, a weak-willed Sekhema named Balbala betrayed her {akhara} for a promise of {welakath,} a mythical elixir said to bestow great power. She led a band of foreign warriors through secret paths to the top of the Halani Gates. Taken by surprise, the {akhara} was slain to the last woman. What was her reward? Not {welakath.} The bandits put a spear through her gut in that very passage. A cautionary tale, yes. For her betrayal, the wise women of that era enacted an ancient ritual, trapping Balbala's soul as a Djinn for a sentence intended to be one thousand years. It has been far more than one thousand years. By Zarka's reckoning, at least two or three. The stain of Balbala's betrayal has been lifted from her legacy, yet the knowledge of her prison was lost long ago...

#### Prisoner Freed
So, you released Balbala from her prison, and she fought well. Good. I'm sure you know what to do next, but touch the {barya} and ask her, if your time away from the Maraketh has faded your knowledge of the tales.
![[Shambrin - Prisoner Freed.ogg]]

#### Prisoner Freed_2
So, you released Balbala from her prison, and she fought well. Good. She may now earn her redemption, if the ancient places still hold power. Her {barya} contains her soul. She will tell you what to do next.
![[Shambrin - Prisoner Freed_2.ogg]]

#### Tradition's Toll
As we approach Deshar, I feel I must ask something of you once more. There is someone... I care about. Let us leave it at that. I have learned she went on a lone journey to the spires three moons past... and she has not returned. The others cannot know of this, for there was neither sickness nor injury involved. Do you understand? I simply wish to know the truth of what happened, to end the pain of not knowing. If you happen to find Lailuma's body in the dunes below the spires... And if you bring me something of hers, then I will know. If you do not, then no one ever will...

![[Shambrin - Tradition's Toll - 3.ogg]]

#### Lailuma's Disappearance
I don't know how things are done in your akhara, but here, those that cannot earn burial in the sky have a tradition of their own. Because they are not allowed to rest above, when they feel sickness or injury taking hold, they leap from the windswept heights of Deshar to the dunes below. Though their bodies will still be lost in the sands our greatest fear lying at the base of honour is the next best thing to lying upon it. You can understand why I was concerned that Lailuma chose to travel there alone...

![[Shambrin - Lailuma's Disappearance - 2.ogg]]

#### Lailuma's Disappearance_2
Those Maraketh that prove themselves in life earn burial in the sky, but the weak and unfortunate have a tradition of their own: because they are not allowed to rest above, when they feel sickness or injury taking hold, they leap from the windswept heights of Deshar to the dunes below. Though their bodies will still be lost in the sands our greatest fear lying at the base of honour is the next best thing to lying upon it. You can understand why I was concerned that Lailuma chose to travel there alone...

#### Give Shambrin the Final Letter
You found a letter? For your sake, do not speak of its contents. I will burn it. When I have the opportunity, I intend to return to Deshar and mark the location of Lailuma's body... A stone perhaps, something inconspicuous. Others will not know, but I will. She will be remembered.

#### Blindness
Does the scorpion's sting carry less poison at night? In the hopes of taking on fighting duty again, I am still practicing the art of the sword. Red-eyed Nasima, she of the Second Sight, proved that there is more to combat than mere vision. However, there is still honour in serving the role of tradesmith and weaponmaster. I served as a {dekhara} for as long as I was able, and I intend to fulfill this duty with just as much dedication.
![[Shambrin - Blindness - 1.ogg]]
![[Shambrin - Blindness - 2.ogg]]

#### The Faridun
Publicly, I will decry them as loudly as anyone else. Privately, I understand. I do not condone their actions, but I have suffered some small portion of what they must feel their entire lives. To be honest, I {expected} them to turn on us eventually.
![[Shambrin - The Faridun - 1.ogg]]
![[Shambrin - The Faridun - 2.ogg]]

#### Risu
This defector, Risu, will never be accepted by the Ardura. You may trust her, and she may provide information about the enemy's intentions, but remember, she is a traitor to her people. We deal with our own traitors using... excessive means. She is not one of us, so we do not consider it our duty to punish her, but neither will we protect her when the time comes.
![[Shambrin - Risu - 1.ogg]]
![[Shambrin - Risu - 2.ogg]]

#### Risu_2
Risu has proven herself, at least to me. She has spoken only the truth, and I believe she means well. In another life, we might have been fellow {dekhara,} or even friends.
![[Shambrin - Risu_2.ogg]]

#### The Hooded One
When I face his direction, there is a faint... impression. Even the sun does not intrude upon my blindness, so this is a new sensation for me. What am I seeing from your strange companion?
![[Shambrin - The Hooded One.ogg]]

#### Zarka
I have heard that you {rejected} the life of a tale-woman. Please don't hold bitterness against Zarka for her role. She holds all the wisdom and knowledge of the Ardura, and the stories of many other akharas as well. Our traditions helped us survive as these lands turned to dust over the generations, and in many ways, that lush beauty still exists for us through her words.
![[Shambrin - Zarka - 1.ogg]]
![[Shambrin - Zarka - 2.ogg]]

#### Zarka_2
Zarka holds all the wisdom and knowledge of the Ardura, and the stories of many other akharas as well. Our traditions helped us survive as these lands turned to dust over the generations, and in many ways, that lush beauty still exists for us through her words. Especially now the gods have returned to Wraeclast, we know that our beliefs have power. Perhaps we can bring back those verdant forests and gleaming rivers, if only we have enough faith in a leader strong enough to make it real.
![[Shambrin - Zarka_2 - 1.ogg]]
![[Shambrin - Zarka_2 - 2.ogg]]

#### Asala
I remember her face, from before the battle where I lost my sight. She is quite beautiful, and she has strength and cunning to match. I can think of no better leader for us. We Ardura have put all of our faith in Asala, and though we do not number enough to spark Divinity in her, we have still thrived under her leadership.
![[Shambrin - Asala - 1.ogg]]
![[Shambrin - Asala - 2.ogg]]

#### A Parting Vision
You came to us a banished stranger, but you will leave as a friend. For that reason, I must tell you this, though it may sound like a child spinning tales. When I turn toward your stealthy companion, I see a glimmer of fearful light in my perpetual darkness. When I gaze unseeing toward the swamps you intend to brave, I see the opposite on the horizon. A darker night than blindness itself. The backside of a sunset, over a temple drenched in blood. I do not know what this vision means, but I fear for you. Be wary.
![[Shambrin - A Parting Vision - 1.ogg]]

#### A Parting Vision_2
You came here a {jingakh,} but will leave as a friend. For that reason, I must tell you this, though it may sound like a child spinning tales. When I turn toward your stealthy companion, I see a glimmer of fearful light in my perpetual darkness. When I gaze unseeing toward the swamps you intend to brave, I see the opposite on the horizon. A darker night than blindness itself. The backside of a sunset, over a temple drenched in blood. I do not know what this vision means, but I fear for you. Be wary.

#### Jamanra
Jamanra has risen... It is... Almost unthinkable. To resort to necromancy and corruption... The Faridun's desperation knows no limits. In a way, it is rather sad. In another, it is harrowing. Either way, this King of theirs, must return to his death.
![[Shambrin - Jamanra.ogg]]

#### Jamanra_2
Now the sandstorm is cleared, we have a chance to chase down Jamanra. Though I am not gifted with sight, I clearly see the dangers ahead of us. You must keep your wits about you.
![[Shambrin - Jamanra_2.ogg]]

#### Jamanra_3
The risen {King} is dead once again. Another tale of the harsh desert. This time, his death was honourable. Asala did this intentionally and I admire her for it. The Faridun have already begun the process of taking his body to Deshar for a proper sky burial. Asala allowed this... You understand the significance here. Perhaps... We could be stepping into the light of a new era for our people.
![[Shambrin - Jamanra_3 - 1.ogg]]
![[Shambrin - Jamanra_3 - 2.ogg]]

#### Jamanra_4
The risen {King} is dead once again. His tale is yet another tragic outcome of the harsh desert. At least this time, the death was honourable. Asala did this intentionally and I admire her for it. The Faridun have already begun the process of taking his body to Deshar for a proper sky burial. Asala allowed this. It feels like... We could be stepping into the light of a new era for the Maraketh.
![[Shambrin - Jamanra_4 - 1.ogg]]
![[Shambrin - Jamanra_4 - 2.ogg]]

#### Asala_2
With that speech, she has woven a hopeful tapestry for our future. Our Sekhema leaves nothing to chance. By beheading Jamanra, she has both dealt a deadly strike and begun the process of healing an old wound. Perhaps it is enough to begin a conversation with the Faridun. Perhaps... There is a way forward for all.
