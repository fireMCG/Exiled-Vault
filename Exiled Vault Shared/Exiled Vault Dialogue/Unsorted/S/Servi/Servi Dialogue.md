## Servi Dialogue
#### Introduction
You the one who waded through the undead in the Marsh, eh? Truly, you need a guide. Luck's on your side today, friend. I am such a guide. Maybe... I can help you survive... Not all tribes in this region are so friendly. You would be wise to listen to me on the dangers of the jungle. Yes... you are lucky, indeed.

#### Apus
Apus is my grandson. Can you believe that? A young spry thing like me, a grandmother? Ha ha ha!... Don't be answerin' that. Apus inherited my son's rowdy spirit. Maybe it's a family curse. We have always been the type to do what we shouldn't... like helping outsiders, such as yourself. One day, he'll be a great man, just like his father. Until then, I try to keep him safe.

#### Dangers of the Jungle
{Everything} here can kill you. A snake you can't see, a strange plant... even one of your own. Survival in the jungle depends upon learning the lessons from those who died before you. That's the wisdom of my tribe, and since these treasure hunters pay me so well, I don't mind sharin'. Hah hah! Any place you want to know about, come to me with questions and I'll tell you what I know.

#### The Wetlands
The Wetlands are breeding grounds for the jungle's most vicious creatures. Pretty, it's true, with colours like sunshine in rain... but deadly all the same. Plenty a fool treasure hunter head there, but never return - least not alive. Watch out for the flowers that move without a breeze. Them are serpents, hidin' in the jungle, spittin' poison. A massive flyin' beast hunts that place. Some say it got the head of a lion, others say it looks like a Gorebeast. Some talk 'bout a tail like a Maraketh scorpion. But the truth? It doesn't matter. None from my tribe have set foot there in forty-three seasons.

#### Servi_G3_Snake_Pit_Out_Loud
So this is the source of the Azakh-Kul poison!

#### Poison Alchemy
So this the source of the Orok poison! Long time ago, this crypt was a resting place for the Vaal. But since their time, the Orok come here to worship the Three-Headed Snake. Even them couldn't survive her poison. This venom... You have found the dark heart of the Orok wickedness. If those savages can learn to use it, maybe I can too. Let me see...

![[Servi - Poison Alchemy - 2.ogg]]

#### ServiHandsPlayerVial
Heh heh heh! Drink this. A foul brew, but you'll thank me... if you survive.
![[Servi - ServiHandsPlayerVial.ogg]]

#### The Azak Tribe
Be warned, friend. The waterways on the Matlan river be a barrier between us and the Azak tribe. The Orok may be trouble, but the Azak... them a true horror. Their queen-witch, Ignagduk, takes a child every blood moon night. Why, I won't guess. If you trespass, only death awaits you. But if you survive, while you are there... please, rip out her {heart!}
![[Servi - The Azak Tribe - 1.ogg]]
![[Servi - The Azak Tribe - 2.ogg]]

#### Servi_G3_Carver_Bog_Out_Loud
You slain the Beastmaster? You are truly the shadow of death! With that kind of strength, you could deal the Azak tribe a deadly blow. Beyond this place, that's where them make their home. Their queen-witch, Ignagduk... she must die. She take a child from my tribe every blood moon, and keeps their spirit trapped. Free them, and we reward you as best we can.
![[Servi - Servi_G3_Carver_Bog_Out_Loud - 1.ogg]]
![[Servi - Servi_G3_Carver_Bog_Out_Loud - 2.ogg]]

#### Ignagduk, the Bog Witch
You are confident, I give you that. Do you truly believe you can beat the Azak tribe? Do so, and my people would be forever grateful. Slay Ignagduk and free the spirits of our stolen children!
![[Servi - Ignagduk, the Bog Witch.ogg]]

#### The Bog Witch, Slain
You have slain the Bog Witch? Then you have healed a wound on the heart of my people. Today, these swamps be blessed by a touch of sunlight.
![[Servi - The Bog Witch, Slain.ogg]]

#### The Matlan Waterways
The jungle's not even the worst of your worries over there. On the other side of the waterways, you'll find a fierce tribe - the Azak. Them turn animals into savage monsters... real beastmasters, but wicked to the core. Tread careful 'round them.
![[Servi - The Matlan Waterways.ogg]]

#### The Orok Tribe
We been clashin' with the Orok tribe for generations. But their real fight is with the Azak, and them are losin'. The Orok worship the Three-Headed Snake - them poison the jungle, poison themselves, poison us too. Their shaman? Only seen her twice - she move like a panther in the dark. The coward. Evil in the shadows, my friend. Evil in the shadows. If you find the source of their wickedness, you let me know. I must see it for myself to make an antidote.
![[Servi - The Orok Tribe - 1.ogg]]
![[Servi - The Orok Tribe - 2.ogg]]

#### Jungle Ruins
The jungle ruins are full of deadly creatures, you know. Quadrillas can tear a man apart in seconds - but at least you can hear them comin'. The real danger? The apes that drop down from above. Life is plenty here, thrivin' for generations, but death always comes for the careless.
![[Servi - Jungle Ruins - 1.ogg]]
![[Servi - Jungle Ruins - 2.ogg]]

#### The Search
Ah, so you after blood crystals - the thing Alva call Soul Cores. I knew you were going to be trouble! Out there in the dark, there's an ancient ruin - very old indeed. My tribe has spoke of it for generations. We seen strange creatures there - made of stone, unnatural, with unblinkin' eyes. That place? It is forsaken. I would warn you not to go there. But if it's Soul Cores you seek, then take the risk you must.
![[Servi - The Search - 1.ogg]]
![[Servi - The Search - 2.ogg]]

#### Servi_G3_Town_Yell_At_Kid1
Apus, stop fooling around!
![[Servi - Servi_G3_Town_Yell_At_Kid1.ogg]]

#### Servi_G3_Town_Yell_At_Kid3
Apus, don't play on that!
![[Servi - Servi_G3_Town_Yell_At_Kid3.ogg]]

#### Servi_G3_Town_Yell_At_Kid5
Apus, get down from there!
![[Servi - Servi_G3_Town_Yell_At_Kid5.ogg]]

#### Infested Barrens
You might think it no big deal, the hive broods livin' round there. But let me tell you, them no ordinary pests. Them are warriors - armies of crawlin' fiends. Them hide under the ground, waitin' to ambush the unwary. If you see hives or nests, keep well clear.
![[Servi - Infested Barrens - 1.ogg]]
![[Servi - Infested Barrens - 2.ogg]]

#### The Venom Crypts
There's danger in them Venom Crypts. Long time ago, they were a burial ground for the Vaal, but now snakes make homes in the ribs of the dead. In there, you see corpses walkin', made slaves by the snakes inside of them... a sight to haunt your dreams, it's true.
![[Servi - The Venom Crypts - 1.ogg]]
![[Servi - The Venom Crypts - 2.ogg]]

#### Door in the Jungle
Strange dreams, my friend. Strange dreams. Chaos doesn't bother me so much, but... we keep far away from that place, ya hear?
![[Servi - Door in the Jungle.ogg]]

#### The Azak Bog
The Azak, them are true monsters. Not cannibals, no, but them will not hesitate to feed you to their war beasts. The Azak and the Orok tribes been fightin' almost as long as the Vaal been gone. But the Azak are beyond cruel. Their queen-witch, Ignagduk, she takes a child every blood moon night... for what, I won't say. If you cross into their territory, only death awaits you there.
![[Servi - The Azak Bog - 1.ogg]]
![[Servi - The Azak Bog - 2.ogg]]

#### The Lake
The Vaal built massive waterways to turn swamp into richer lands. But when them betrayed nature and cracked the world, nature did what she do best and took back the earth. Sad story, I guess, but too long ago to matter now.
![[Servi - The Lake.ogg]]

#### The Ruin
Past the Wetlands, there's an ancient ruin. My tribe has spoke of it for generations now. We seen strange creatures there - made of stone, unnatural, with unblinkin' eyes. That place? It is forsaken. I warn you, don't go there. But I know... you won't listen to Servi, will you?
![[Servi - The Ruin - 1.ogg]]
![[Servi - The Ruin - 2.ogg]]

#### The Drained Lake
You shoulda never drained the lake. My tribe depends on the waters for our safety. How will we fend off the Orok or the Azak now? And worse, you have unleashed the horrors of the Vaal once more. Know this: you bring up bad omens from the depths that shoulda stayed buried, and you will regret it.
![[Servi - The Drained Lake - 1.ogg]]
![[Servi - The Drained Lake - 2.ogg]]

#### Doryani's Capture
You bring someone we only talk 'bout in our darkest tale. That man is not just a myth - him a monster from the shadows of the past. His arrogance helped crack the world. And now you bring him here, to us, and expect him to help you? You would doom us all.
![[Servi - Doryani's Capture.ogg]]

#### The Time Portal
You know not what you do. A great darkness comes. You meddle with what has been, and who knows what will happen because of it. What is dead should stay dead. Close the gateway and leave it alone, I say.
![[Servi - The Time Portal.ogg]]

#### My Son
This... This is my son. When he did not return from the jungle, I feared the worst, but I still had hope. The warring tribes have taken that hope away from me. Curse the Azak, curse the Orok... And curse this day.
![[Servi - My Son.ogg]]

#### Apus_2
Promise me... You will not tell Apus that his father is dead. Let him remain a child, for one more day...
![[Servi - Apus_2.ogg]]

#### Son
It hurt me deeply to find him there... To find him... Like that. Still, I thank you for findin' his body. His spirit roams the jungle with his father's now. The warring tribes... the Azak... The Orok... They have a lot to answer for.
![[Servi - Son - 1.ogg]]

![[Servi - ServiVendor_BuyFlaskMana_7.ogg]]

#### ServiVendor_BuyFlaskMana_11
Fight longer, fight harder.
![[Servi - ServiVendor_BuyFlaskMana_11.ogg]]

#### ServiVendor_CloseShopNoBuy_5
Well, well... Next time then.
![[Servi - ServiVendor_CloseShopNoBuy_5.ogg]]

#### ServiVendor_CloseShopNoBuy_9
As you like.

Job is done.
![[Servi - ServiVendor_Disenchant_Random.ogg]]

#### ServiVendor_Disenchant_4
What do you think?
![[Servi - ServiVendor_Disenchant_4.ogg]]

#### ServiVendor_Disenchant_8
Not as easy as it looks.
![[Servi - ServiVendor_Disenchant_8.ogg]]

#### ServiVendor_Disenchant_12
It's now... In pieces.

#### ServiVendor_OpenShop_8
Some pretty things, yes?
![[Servi - ServiVendor_OpenShop_8.ogg]]

#### ServiVendor_OpenShop_12
Take your time.
![[Servi - ServiVendor_OpenShop_12.ogg]]

#### ServiVendor_Sell_Random
My tribe could use that.
![[Servi - ServiVendor_Sell_Random.ogg]]

#### ServiVendor_Sell_4
I'll take it.
![[Servi - ServiVendor_Sell_4.ogg]]

#### ServiVendor_Sell_7
It's a deal.
![[Servi - ServiVendor_Sell_7.ogg]]
