## Cadiro Perandus Dialogue
#### Introduction
Now you have the look of a connoisseur, an educated appreciator of all things exquisite and dangerous. And I, Cadiro, am one who provides such delights. Once a lord of influence and opulence, I am now but a humble peddler seeking to recover his lost fortunes. Gold coins of Perandus mintage, secreted away in gilded chests so as to escape the grasping digits of that puritanical usurper, Voll of Thebrus. Perhaps you have seen such chests on your travels? If so, I could offer you antiquities of remarkable potency, paraphernalia of pernicious craftsmanship. All I would ask in return is the conveyance of the contents of said chests to my person. As fortune would have it, I have such a wonder in stock even now. A relic of such formidable agency that I shudder to think what it could do in the hands of one predisposed to use it. For a little coin, those hands could be yours.
![[Cadiro Perandus - Introduction.ogg]]

#### Perandus Coins
Yes, you are quite right to query my curious penchant for obsolete currency. Once there was a time when my personal symphony was composed, quite completely, of the delightful tinklings of coinage. Nowadays, I'm dancing to someone else's tune. I have a backer, you see, who generously supports my ongoing liquidity. Naturally, he expects a good return on his investment, and it transpires that only coinage of the golden variety will satiate that expectation.
![[Cadiro Perandus - Perandus Coins.ogg]]

#### Chitus Perandus
Chitus was shaping up to be the greatest leader since Veruso. My nephew's gemling thaumatocracy would have made the Empire truly eternal, would have raised mankind up from the fragile muck of flesh and blood. And the wealth... oh the riches that could have flowed through the Empire's capitalist capillaries. Then that idiot of a High Templar had to come along and ruin it all. Him and his 'God of Purity' and his army of fanatics and barbarians. A veritable horde of ignorance. If Chitus had lived, the Empire would have lived, and oh what a wondrous and eternal life it would have had!
![[Cadiro Perandus - Chitus Perandus.ogg]]

#### The Perandus Family
The same day that Veruso planted his banner in the soil of Sarn, the Perandus family built the first market stall. That one stall spawned so many others that the people came to call our venture {Perandus Markets}. We were never vain enough to make the name official. Until Chitus took the throne, we were a most unassuming consortium. Yes, we did occasionally employ the Silent Brotherhood to remove the more stubborn obstacles to our commercial endeavours, but for the most part we tended to solve our issues with coin and contract rather than bow and blade. In hindsight, we should have taken the reins of power much earlier. If we had done so then perhaps I could now be speaking of Perandus in the plural rather than the singular.
![[Cadiro Perandus - The Perandus Family.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnManor
This was once the pride and joy of the Perandus name. A habitable monument to our mercantile potency. Balls and banquets filled these halls with music and intrigue. Counsels and contracts festooned our studies and boardrooms. Capital built our walls and profits polished our gleaming floors. Alas, that which is shiny shall dull. That which is grand shall crumble. Such is the stark reality of materialism. Yet this place retains a certain 'decrepit opulence' that reminds me of the better times that were, and the better times that still could be.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnManor.ogg]]

#### Cataclysm
When you're a {fat purse} such as I, you are wise to insure yourself against being slit and emptied. In the face of Voll's ridiculous crusade to Highgate, I thought it only prudent to bolster my insurance policies. It was in our household god, Prospero, that I found my ideal underwriter. While my relations paid tithe and lip service to Prospero the symbol, Prospero the myth, I chose to dig a little deeper than that. To my delight, it transpired that our god was not only real, but of a similar opinion regarding the near, uncertain future of the Empire. We signed a contract, Prospero and I, and more than two centuries have borne witness to our successful partnership. The best deal I ever made.
![[Cadiro Perandus - Cataclysm.ogg]]

#### Prospero
The god of lost souls and found treasures. Lord of the underworld and all its material bounty. Gems, precious metals, coal... a myriad of subterranean substances, exotic and volatile. If it has value and it can be unearthed with pick and shovel, it falls within Prospero's divine concerns. As do all those who trade in them. Prospero was a god of our ancestors, the Azmerians. As we Eternals descended from those mountains, our gods descended with us. To the mundane mind they are myths, nothing but stories. To those with a little more imagination, they can be so much more.
![[Cadiro Perandus - Prospero.ogg]]

#### Izaro
Izaro Phrecius? Despite my personal feelings surrounding that man, he did provide we Perandus folk with an unprecedented opportunity. Over the centuries, the Phrecius family had blocked our every attempt to gain the throne on the scandalous basis that our blood was not of imperial quality. So when Izaro called that whole blood fiasco into question with his Lord's Labyrinth, it gave us the only clear shot we would ever have at sovereignty. Without Izaro, the Perandus name may never have come to be associated with the throne. So in a somewhat qualified fashion, he has my gratitude.
![[Cadiro Perandus - Izaro.ogg]]

#### Izaro_2
So you've polished off Izaro's 'Lord's Labyrinth' have you? Proved that you have the mettle for imperial leadership. Sadly, the Empire isn't what it used to be, but you're more than welcome to knock it back into shape for us. Despite my personal feelings surrounding Izaro Phrecius, he did provide we Perandus folk with an unprecedented opportunity. Over the centuries, the Phrecius family had blocked our every attempt to gain the throne, on the scandalous basis that our blood was not of imperial quality. So when Izaro called that whole blood fiasco into question with his Lord's Labyrinth, it gave us the only clear shot we would ever have at sovereignty. Without Izaro, the Perandus name may never have come to be associated with the throne. So in a somewhat qualified fashion, he has my gratitude.
![[Cadiro Perandus - Izaro_2.ogg]]

#### _trade_complete_
You're getting quite a deal there.
![[Cadiro Perandus - _trade_complete_.ogg]]

#### _trade_complete__2
Oh, and 'refund' is not in my vocabulary.
![[Cadiro Perandus - _trade_complete__2.ogg]]

#### _trade_complete__3
May Prospero bless this trade.
![[Cadiro Perandus - _trade_complete__3.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnChaosOrb1
You know... I thought about making a deal with Chaos, but the price was too high. Prospero is a much better master.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnChaosOrb1.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnChaosOrb2
It's been well over a century since I've bargained with the entity known as Chaos.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnChaosOrb2.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnDivineOrb1
I see you've got a Divine Orb there. Ah, that would make a fine addition to the Perandus cache...
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnDivineOrb1.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnDivineOrb2
I see you've got a Divine Orb there. One of the most coveted currencies in the realm, to be sure.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnDivineOrb2.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnExaltedOrb1
An Exalted Orb? These used to be worth a lot more, you know.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnExaltedOrb1.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnExaltedOrb2
Exalted Orbs were once revered by the people of Wraeclast, celebrated in pure exaltation. But now that the ceremonies have ceased, their worth is waning.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnExaltedOrb2.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnSacredOrb1
A Sacred Orb? A considerably rare piece of currency.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnSacredOrb1.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnSacredOrb2
A Sacred Orb? Best left to the highly experienced.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnSacredOrb2.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnVaalOrb1
I don't deal in currency I don't understand.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnVaalOrb1.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnVaalOrb2
I don't know what that piece of currency is... and honestly, it looks unnerving.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnVaalOrb2.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnMirrorOfKalandra1
Rumour has it that Kalandra is an ancient being, eternally trapped in a lake that exists outside Wraeclast, possessing the body of an owl and the head of a human. Sounds a bit ridiculous to me.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnMirrorOfKalandra1.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnMirrorOfKalandra2
You have a Mirror of Kalandra? An exceptionally rare find. I've only ever seen one before, and I've seen almost everything.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnMirrorOfKalandra2.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnRoguesMarker1
A Rogue's Marker? That will take you straight to a den of thieves. Can't say I'm affiliated with common scoundrels, but I know a discerning eye when I see one.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnRoguesMarker1.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnRoguesMarker2
Rogue's Markers? I hear those will buy you all kinds of mischief in the Rogue Harbour.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnRoguesMarker2.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnSoulTaker1
Soul Taker... It's rumoured that axe claims the souls of its victims.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnSoulTaker1.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnSoulTaker2
Soul Taker... It's rumoured that axe chills the souls of its victims.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnSoulTaker2.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnActum
You're not particularly bright, are you? But I'd rather not get on your bad side while you're wielding that... thing.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnActum.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnKingmaker
A weapon symbolising pure rebellion. I'd be careful with the sharp end, if I were you. You might end up overthrowing an empire.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnKingmaker.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnDoomfletch
It's said that arrows loosed from Doomfletch channel the primordial elements themselves.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnDoomfletch.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnIronCommander
Ah, I remember when entire legions were commanded by the Eternal holding that bow...
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnIronCommander.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnTheGluttonousTide
Oh, to lose oneself in gorging upon the riches of a crumbling empire... It wasn't until I entered the service of Prospero that I began to relax a little.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnTheGluttonousTide.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnReachOfTheCouncil
There is immense power in unity. Never forget this. A lone Undying is as mindless as an automaton, but a legion of Undying is a force to be reckoned with.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnReachOfTheCouncil.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnWindripper
It is said that Windripper contains the very essence of the tempests themselves.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnWindripper.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnLawOfTheWilds
The Law of the Wilds... an inevitable strengthening process in which the powerful are rewarded, and the weak are exterminated.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnLawOfTheWilds.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnArakaalisFang
Make no mistake, my Azmeri ancestors worshipped Arakaali long before the Vaal did, although I'm not entirely sure why. She was hardly a goddess of love or fertility; no, she was naught but a predator, ensnaring her victims in silk and sedating them with venom.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnArakaalisFang.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnTheHiddenBlade
The Hidden Blade is aptly named. Your enemies won't know what hit them.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnTheHiddenBlade.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnSongOfTheSirens
The Song of the Sirens... almost as alluring as the clinking of gold coins in a nobleman's pocket. And just as elusive...
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnSongOfTheSirens.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnReefbane
Only a fool goes looking for a fortune at the bottom of a lake.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnReefbane.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnMjolner
An almighty mace. I hope your foes enjoy the calm before the storm.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnMjolner.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnTrypanon
It's a little odd to see you wielding the Trypanon, given that it once resided in the Perandus stronghold. Icius was always a little wary of it, given its, ahem, previous applications...
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnTrypanon.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnMarohiErqi
Ah yes, Marohi Erqi. It once fell into the hands of the Perandus family while we were on a brief excursion to the Karui Archipelago.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnMarohiErqi.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnAtzirisRule
Atziri's Rule! A leftover relic from the Vaal Empire. As formidable a staff as the Vaal Queen herself.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnAtzirisRule.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnPledgeOfHands
It's ironic that Queen Atziri's advisor placed such high value on forming alliances, given that the Queen's subjects were being sacrificed to power the Vaal empire...
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnPledgeOfHands.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnVarunastra
Varunastra... Another relic that was within the grasp of our family for a time. Yet now you brandish it, as if ignorant of its true value...
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnVarunastra.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnTheSaviour
History never clarifies who is the saviour and who is the tyrant.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnTheSaviour.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnParadoxica
Ah yes, Paradoxica. One of many relics that the Order of the Djinn fought to protect. They thought they operated in secret, but Perandus coin unveils all secrets in time.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnParadoxica.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnCosprisMalice
Never before have I encountered a weapon that chills the very air around it. If only I were still in the manor, I'd have one of the servants light a fire...
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnCosprisMalice.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnStarforge
You've stumbled upon old Starforge, hmm? It's said that this blade was forged by the Order of the Djinn and given to the Watchers of Decay, who used it to seal away the Elder. Not quite sure how it ended up in your possession, but wield it with caution.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnStarforge.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnVoidBattery
Void Battery – a hideous instrument used for a variety of unpleasant ends. It was a favourite tool of Inquisitor Maligaro. He was a very nasty man.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnVoidBattery.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnGreedsEmbrace
Greed's Embrace gleams golden even in the evening light, which is fitting, given the wealth of currency it attracts. Needless to say, I am rather fond of this one.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnGreedsEmbrace.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnVentorsGamble
Bear in mind that even the most perilous of risks can be worth taking, given the level of calculation done prior.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnVentorsGamble.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnLioneyesVision
Ah, you're wearing the platemail of that old sod. Marceus Lioneye had about as much military vision as he did actual sight, which is to say, very little. He lost Lioneye's Watch to a siege by savages... A colossal failure.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnLioneyesVision.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnKaomsHeart
Kaom's Heart? Rotten to the core. I genuinely can't believe that madman commanded an army... ruled through barbarism and coercion, no doubt.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnKaomsHeart.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnTabulaRasa
Are you encased in a white sheet? Oh, I see. You're wearing Tabula Rasa. Suffice it to say, you blend in. You could be anything.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnTabulaRasa.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnDiallasMalefaction
Ah... Dear Dialla. So intent on serving Malachai to the bitter end. Once upon a time, she was one of Chitus' mistresses, but her lustre didn't last. He turned her over to a thaumaturgist many times, and ultimately she fell into Malachai's hands – which led to all those dreadful gem implants...
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnDiallasMalefaction.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnShavronnesWrappings
What on Earth are you wearing? That gaudy old robe... Ah, I actually recognise it as Shavronne's. Her attire became more lurid and twisted as her mind grew more corrupted.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnShavronnesWrappings.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnDaressosDefiance
Daresso's Defiance... A fine piece of craftsmanship, although it didn't get him very far. His fate is one I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnDaressosDefiance.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnVollsProtector
I see you're wearing Voll's Protector. Needless to say, I'm not overly fond of Voll, who spearheaded the revolution to overthrow my nephew's empire. The Purity Rebellion culminated in Chitus' death, and Voll is predominantly to blame.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnVollsProtector.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnGeofrisSanctuary
Ah, I see you've got Geofri's ringmail. That man was one of Voll's lackeys, forever plotting and scheming alongside him. I do commend him for having a hand in Inquisitor Maligaro's downfall, though.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnGeofrisSanctuary.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnShroudOfTheLightless
The Shroud of the Lightless is immeasurably ancient, stemming from a time when none but the Lightless prevailed. Repugnant creatures who infested Prospero's domain with their wickedness.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnShroudOfTheLightless.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnFarrulsFur
Furs blessed by an Ezomyte goddess? I'd wash those before you wear them. The Ezomytes are a primitive breed, yet they fancy themselves as romantic poets. Make no mistake: what they lack in eloquence, they make up for with sheer brutality.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnFarrulsFur.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnTheSquire
I see you're using a shield as your squire. Do you really hate people that much? You must be quite the misanthrope... After all, you are drenched in the blood of your enemies.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnTheSquire.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnLycosidae
Careful now. An apex predator such as yourself might soon become the prey.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnLycosidae.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnTukohamasFortress
Tukohama's Fortress... This is said to be a relic taken from the very walls of his abode. What kind of brute would vandalise his own home to make a shield? Well, I suppose it wasn't a manor...
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnTukohamasFortress.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnCrestOfPerandus
Now there's a shield I recognise, emblazoned with my family crest. "With piety and justice"... it's a shame that Piety's misdemeanours tainted that motto for us permanently.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnCrestOfPerandus.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnEmperorsVigilance
One of the finest kite shields I've ever had the pleasure of laying eyes upon – and an aptly named one. Emperor Chitus was forever vigilant, only taking calculated risks which he knew would fortify his position. I suppose it must run in the family, heh.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnEmperorsVigilance.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnMahuxotlsMachination
Mahuxotl's Machination. An enigmatic shield, to be sure, imbued with the darkest of Vaal magics by the Banished Architect himself.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnMahuxotlsMachination.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnAegisAurora
The Aegis Aurora? That's a mighty fine shield you've got there. If Chitus had had a shield like that, things might have gone differently.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnAegisAurora.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnMagnaEclipsis
Ah, the Magna Eclipsis. I hear it glows more brightly during a solar eclipse.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnMagnaEclipsis.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnHeadhunter
Oho, a mighty Headhunter! I'm {so} impressed. Try to duck when the brain fragments splatter everywhere, you wouldn't want to sully your armour.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnHeadhunter.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnMageblood
Who needs Mageblood when you have liquid gold in your veins?
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnMageblood.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnUmbilicusImmortalis
The Umbilicus Immortalis. Icius was fond of this one. He spent hours poring over it, trying to determine the origin of its arcane properties. He couldn't understand why your wounds seem to heal over when you wear it.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnUmbilicusImmortalis.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnPerandusSignet
Ah, the Perandus Signet! How could I not recognise this fine piece of craftsmanship? I do miss dear old Medici... he was an outstanding advisor, and we devised many clever plots together to bolster the wealth of the Treasury.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnPerandusSignet.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnKaomsSign
Word has it that Kaom saw this ring as a sign for him to lead his people to Wraeclast, although I wish he hadn't.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnKaomsSign.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnMalachaisArtifice
Malachai was a treacherous old bastard, but he certainly knew how to master the thaumaturgical arts. It's said that this ring was one of many instruments he used to manipulate virtue gems.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnMalachaisArtifice.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnShavronnesRevelation
Shavronne's Revelation? Ha. Perhaps if Shavronne had truly seen the light, she wouldn't have been so easily slain.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnShavronnesRevelation.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnKaomsSpirit
The Karui Way preaches a number of fallacies, all dutifully upheld by its ignorant followers. Kaom was arguably its strongest proponent... but if he had truly been a traditionalist, he wouldn't have murdered his own army.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnKaomsSpirit.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnAnglersPlait
Best I not speak on this one...
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnAnglersPlait.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnRomirasBanquet
Romira's Banquet? Ugh. Romira Phrecian, the absolute savage, fed his wife's two sons to her during that famed banquet. It was an act of vengeance, since her sons were sired by his brother.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnRomirasBanquet.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnTriumvirateAuthority
It's said that the Triumvirate Authority is imbued with the sigil of the god Yaomac – the shepherd of Vaal souls, and the arbiter of the balance of the seasons. Three unique blessings are conferred by each of Yaomac's three serpentine heads.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnTriumvirateAuthority.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnBadgeOfTheBrotherhood
It's strange to see you wearing a Badge of the Brotherhood. The Perandus family are no strangers to the Brotherhood of Silence. Indeed, we have hired their services on many occasions...
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnBadgeOfTheBrotherhood.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnHyrrisTruth
Hyrri's Truth? Her arrows may have struck true, but she was fighting for the wrong cause.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnHyrrisTruth.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnStoneOfLazhwar
Ah, the Stone of Lazhwar. Lazhwar was an unmistakably great mind of our time. Indeed, many of his ideas were stolen by Malachai and used to construct the Eternal Laboratory. It's a shame that Malachai had a hand in his downfall.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnStoneOfLazhwar.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnAtzirisFoible
I see you're wearing Atziri's Foible. Even the Queen's advisors could recognise her folly. You cannot force your people into sacrificing themselves and expect there to be no consequences.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnAtzirisFoible.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnDaressosSalute
Ah yes, Daresso's Salute. An amulet with history behind it. Daresso wore this into the arena many times during his glory days.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnDaressosSalute.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnShapersSeed
The Shaper's Seed is one of the oldest amulets of all time, emerging from a primal landscape without form.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnShapersSeed.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnVictariosAcuity
Victario's Acuity? He may have had a sharp wit, but he wasn't perspicacious enough to evade the Cataclysm.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnVictariosAcuity.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnEyeOfChayula
You're wearing the Eye of Chayula? A truly horrifying entity. He watches the dreams of the unwary, and the willing...
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnEyeOfChayula.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnUulNetolsVow
Uul-Netol's Vow? I've no idea what her vow was, but it was no doubt something nightmarish.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnUulNetolsVow.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnMaligarosCruelty
Maligaro was cruel, indeed. To never feel love, or remorse, or think of the consequences... This was Maligaro through and through. I would hesitate to think of what atrocities he would commit if he were still alive.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnMaligarosCruelty.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnStarOfWraeclast
Ah, The Star of Wraeclast. Daresso gave that necklace to Merveil as a token of his love, and her voice became melodic and pleasing to the ear. Little did he know that it would turn her mind and body into something truly grotesque, ultimately mutating her into a hideous siren – and so Daresso left her, and she pined for the love she'd lost, and fed sailors to her offspring.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnStarOfWraeclast.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnVollsDevotion
Voll's Devotion? Bah! He was devoted to a cause that was far less pure than Victario's writings would have anyone believe.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnVollsDevotion.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnHinekorasSight
Hinekora's Sight, eh? They say all are welcome in Hinekora's eternal home, but I honestly have no desire to go there.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnHinekorasSight.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnAulsUprising
Ah, Aul's Uprising. My nephew was a fine leader, but he could've learned a thing or two from Aul. It's said that Aul, the Crystal King, was once a slave who quarried stone, and he ascended to power predominantly through his leadership. He earned the respect of the people. Chitus could have worked harder to do the same.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnAulsUprising.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnEyeOfInnocence
The Eye of Innocence, huh? Not such a fitting name, given that his gaze incinerated a group of townspeople. Nothing innocent about it.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnEyeOfInnocence.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnLeadershipsPrice
Chitus knew the price of leadership better than anyone. He readily made use of his diplomacy, cunning, and all of the resources at his disposal. But alas, it was not enough to save his life.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnLeadershipsPrice.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnTheAscetic
How does asceticism lead to more wealth? That makes no sense!
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnTheAscetic.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnBiscosCollar
To have a canine at your heel is to have companionship that is almost as valuable as gold. Almost, but not quite.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnBiscosCollar.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnEmpiresGrasp
Ah, Empire's Grasp! My nephew, Chitus, wore these into combat. He was a fine swordsman, and a formidable enemy.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnEmpiresGrasp.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnAtzirisAcuity
Atziri's Acuity? She didn't exactly have an abundance of it. In her narcissism and pursuit of eternal youth, innumerable lives were lost... and she couldn't escape the Cataclysm that was likely her own doing.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnAtzirisAcuity.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnDoryanisFist
Doryani's Fist, hmm? This weapon seems to weave its way in and out of history...
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnDoryanisFist.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnVerusosBatteringRams
Ah, Veruso's Battering Rams. I'm rather fond of dear old Tarcus – may he rest in peace. He founded our hometown of Sarn, where the Perandus family first established their mercantile presence.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnVerusosBatteringRams.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnMaligarosVirtuosity
Maligaro's Virtuosity? He wasn't the most virtuous of individuals, though I suppose the gloves are named after his penchant for virtue gems. He was a masterful thaumaturgist, there's no doubt about it.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnMaligarosVirtuosity.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnKalisasGrace
That's a rather elegant pair of gloves. Kalisa's Grace, if I'm not mistaken. Kalisa Maas, the Prima Donna of Sarn, was the finest opera singer in all of Wraeclast, partly due to the corrupted gem that was implanted in her throat. That very same gem was later set into the Star of Wraeclast – the necklace that transformed Merveil into a monster.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnKalisasGrace.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnGripOfTheCouncil
I don't believe any ever truly leave the Pale Council, not even in death. They have the means to prolong life far beyond the natural order.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnGripOfTheCouncil.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnDoedresMalevolence
Doedre's Malevolence... An aptly named pair of gloves, for her malevolence knew no bounds. Even when her tongue was removed by Maligaro, she still managed to find new methods of spellcasting to continue torturing her subjects.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnDoedresMalevolence.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnHandsOfTheHighTemplar
The Templars consider themselves to be men of faith, but even the most pious of men are amenable to a little coin when it suits them. We've had some dealings in the past...
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnHandsOfTheHighTemplar.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnOndarsClasp
Ondar! That traitorous, treacherous bastard! How dare you flounce about here wearing the gloves of the man who slew the Emperor!
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnOndarsClasp.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnMalachaisMark
Malachai certainly left his mark upon Wraeclast. There are still remnants of his evil plaguing the continent. We may never truly know a land untouched by the Cataclysm.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnMalachaisMark.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnSevenLeagueStep
Ah, I recognise those old boots. Seven-League Step... I used to chase Chitus around the manor when he was small, but when he put those boots on, he started chasing {me}.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnSevenLeagueStep.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnDoryanisDelusion
Icius had much to say about Doryani. Doryani was a cold and calculating figure, one motivated only by a desire to save his people... forever. Take that ominous note as you will. A shame we never managed to excavate Utzaal.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnDoryanisDelusion.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnKaomsRoots
Oh, you're wearing those clanky old things? Kaom's Roots... He fancied himself an almighty warrior, but those rusted greaves could not save him in the end.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnKaomsRoots.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnVictariosFlight
Victario's Flight, eh? He was best known for denigrating my nephew and sowing seeds of dissent among the populace. He couldn't fly far enough. It's fortunate that he met a bitter end.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnVictariosFlight.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnAtzirisStep
Atziri's Step? Bah! Every move she made brought Wraeclast closer to ruin.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnAtzirisStep.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnShavronnesGambit
Like all of Malachai's students, Shavronne was brilliant and adept in the art of deceit.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnShavronnesGambit.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnShavronnesPace
If you can keep up with the pace of Shavronne's accomplishments, you'll be well on your way to success.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnShavronnesPace.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnLioneyesPaws
It's a shame that Marceus couldn't claw out the Karui where they stood.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnLioneyesPaws.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnRalakeshsImpatience
The Vaal gods were cruel masters – I wouldn't want to have tested Ralakesh's patience.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnRalakeshsImpatience.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnAurseize
Aurseize are most auspicious gloves indeed. An old favorite of mine.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnAurseize.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnUsupersPenance
I doubt many usurpers truly show penance. They're too busy reaping the rewards of having overthrown their masters.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnUsupersPenance.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnFairgravesTricorne
Looks like a good hat for fishing. Don't want the sun in your eyes, you know. Perandus Manor was always stocked with all sorts of exotic fish...
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnFairgravesTricorne.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnWreathOfPhrecia
I thank the Phrecians for establishing that labyrinth, which was most certainly in my nephew's favour. But they were shoddy rulers at best.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnWreathOfPhrecia.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnDoedresScorn
Ah, I recognise that circlet. It belonged to Doedre Darktongue... the perverse old hag that she was. Her mind was more twisted even than Malachai's.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnDoedresScorn.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnChitusApex
Oh... I see you're wearing Chitus' Apex. You could show a little respect, you know... He was my nephew, after all.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnChitusApex.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnKitavasThirst
Kitava's Thirst, eh? I have little respect for the Karui, and even less for Kitava... Fah! Gluttonous old fool.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnKitavasThirst.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnGeofrisCrest
Bah, take that blasted crest out of my sight! It belonged to a Phrecian slimeball who worked alongside Voll to overthrow all that I held dear.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnGeofrisCrest.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnCrownOfTheTyrant
The Crown of the Tyrant, hmm? I see you've got some grand aspirations. All I'll say is that you'd do well to ensure that people like you before you grasp the reins of power.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnCrownOfTheTyrant.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnGeofrisLegacy
Geofri's Legacy? Bah! All he left behind was the tattered ruins of an empire, and a primitive vision for the future. He hated thaumaturgy, but can you imagine a world without virtue gems? Think of all the profits squandered...
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnGeofrisLegacy.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnMalachaisVision
Malachai's Vision, eh? You may be wearing his crown, but I doubt you'll ever see things in quite the same way as he did.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnMalachaisVision.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnVollsVision
Honestly, I'm surprised you're wearing Voll's Vision. It's a testament to the acts of treason that threw Wraeclast into disarray.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnVollsVision.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnMalachaisSimula
We're all better off now that Malachai is gone, but you can't say he wasn't a clever old bastard.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnMalachaisSimula.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnMalachaisAwakening
Malachai's Awakening, eh? May he sleep eternally. Although, if I had a mere fraction of the power he had, I'd be even wealthier than I am now.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnMalachaisAwakening.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnZerphisLastBreath
Ah, that flask used to be part of my collection. Zerphi's Last Breath, if I'm not mistaken. He was a serial killer; possibly one who was siphoning life from his victims, since he lived to the ripe old age of 168.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnZerphisLastBreath.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnTheWrithingJar
Ha! The Writhing Jar. High Templar Voll loathed this flask, despite being quite the worm himself...
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnTheWrithingJar.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnSoulCatcher
Word has it that Soul Catcher entraps the souls of those slain by the imbiber, and grants them heightened power.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnSoulCatcher.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnSoulRipper
It's said that Soul Ripper was used by Vaal priests in their dark rituals, to aid their practices of human sacrifice.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnSoulRipper.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnOlrothsResolve
Ah yes, Olroth's Resolve. He had a little too much resolve, if you ask me...
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnOlrothsResolve.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnCinderswallowUrn
The Cinderswallow Urn. Takes me back to the days when Janus Perandus, Chitus' great-grandson, joined the Order of the Djinn. Somehow, most of the Order ended up being dispatched, which allowed Catarina to pilfer the Horns of Kulemak from the Forbidden Vault. Catarina then used the Horns to resurrect the dead – without them becoming Undying – and established the Immortal Syndicate. Janus, of course, has joined the noble ranks of the Immortal Syndicate. I'm a little envious, truth be told.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnCinderswallowUrn.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnDyingSun
Ah... Dying Sun. I imagine that would burn the throat more fiercely than a fine whiskey.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnDyingSun.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnGrandSpectrum
Did you loot that jewel from Izaro's coffers?
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnGrandSpectrum.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnMegalomaniac
A fitting jewel for one such as yourself to be wearing, eh?
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnMegalomaniac.ogg]]

#### CadiroOnVoices
It's said that the gods themselves whisper to the one who harnesses the power of this jewel...
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroOnVoices.ogg]]

#### CadiroMultipleUniques1A
Thank you kindly for adding to my collection.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroMultipleUniques1A.ogg]]

#### CadiroMultipleUniques2A
These will make excellent additions to the Perandus caches.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroMultipleUniques2A.ogg]]

#### CadiroMultipleUniques3A
I might even put these on display.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroMultipleUniques3A.ogg]]

#### CadiroMultipleItemVendorRecipe1A
Let me see what I can rustle up with these.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroMultipleItemVendorRecipe1A.ogg]]

#### CadiroMultipleItemVendorRecipe2A
I know what to do with these.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroMultipleItemVendorRecipe2A.ogg]]

#### CadiroMultipleItemVendorRecipe3A
You want me to do what?
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroMultipleItemVendorRecipe3A.ogg]]

#### CadiroVendorRecipesItemModifier1A
I'm a banker, not a blacksmith!
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroVendorRecipesItemModifier1A.ogg]]

#### CadiroVendorRecipesItemModifier2A
Do you really expect me, a man of esteem and affluence, to do that? Oh, I suppose...
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroVendorRecipesItemModifier2A.ogg]]

#### CadiroVendorRecipesItemModifier3A
You want me to do what? Bah, as long as you're good for the payment.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroVendorRecipesItemModifier3A.ogg]]

#### CadiroDivinationCardStack1A
Did you do that on purpose? No refunds, remember!
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroDivinationCardStack1A.ogg]]

#### CadiroDivinationCardStack2A
Are you sure that's what you meant to do?
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroDivinationCardStack2A.ogg]]

#### CadiroDivinationCardStack3A
Whoops!
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroDivinationCardStack3A.ogg]]

#### CadiroMultipleNormalRarityItems1A
Ah, look what the cat has dragged in... off the dregs of the dungeon floor, no doubt.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroMultipleNormalRarityItems1A.ogg]]

#### CadiroMultipleNormalRarityItems2A
You're selling me... these? I hope you're not expecting much in return...
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroMultipleNormalRarityItems2A.ogg]]

#### CadiroMultipleNormalRarityItems3A
Ah yes, I know a crate in the basement that will be perfect for these to moulder in.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroMultipleNormalRarityItems3A.ogg]]

#### CadiroChaosOrbRecipe1A
I feel strangely compelled to give you a better price than usual for these.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroChaosOrbRecipe1A.ogg]]

#### CadiroChaosOrbRecipe2A
I see you're seeking the favour of Chaos. A risky endeavour.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroChaosOrbRecipe2A.ogg]]

#### CadiroChaosOrbRecipe3A
What an interesting collection! I suppose I can spare a little extra for them.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroChaosOrbRecipe3A.ogg]]

#### CadiroMultipleFlasks1A
That might be a little too much to drink, even for me.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroMultipleFlasks1A.ogg]]

#### CadiroMultipleFlasks2A
I doubt I'll ever be able to quaff all of those.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroMultipleFlasks2A.ogg]]

#### CadiroMultipleFlasks3A
Are you trying to impair my judgement, exile?
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroMultipleFlasks3A.ogg]]

#### CadiroSkillGems1A
Rumour has it that skill gems are essentially crystallised corruption – fragments of the Beast's skin that broke off as it grew. It's also said they are fuelled by the willpower of the user.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroSkillGems1A.ogg]]

#### CadiroUnidentifiedItems1A
It's not entirely clear what these are... Trying to keep me guessing, eh?
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroUnidentifiedItems1A.ogg]]

#### CadiroUnidentifiedItems2A
What in Prospero's name are you trying to sell me?
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroUnidentifiedItems2A.ogg]]

#### CadiroUnidentifiedItems3A
Selling goods you don't even understand displays a marked absence of wisdom.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroUnidentifiedItems3A.ogg]]

#### CadiroNonUniqueFishingRod1A
Pass on my regards to Krillson, if you encounter him.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroNonUniqueFishingRod1A.ogg]]

#### CadiroNonUniqueFishingRod2A
Trawling for treasures, are we?
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroNonUniqueFishingRod2A.ogg]]

#### CadiroSellingItemsForScrollsOfWisdom1A
Perhaps you're somewhat lacking in wisdom? You may need to pore over these scroll fragments for a while.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroSellingItemsForScrollsOfWisdom1A.ogg]]

#### CadiroDemigodUnique1A
This is absolutely priceless! What are you doing, pawning this off to me?
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroDemigodUnique1A.ogg]]

#### CadiroDemigodUnique2A
Selling that to me has got to be one of the most daft acts I've ever seen. This treasure will have its own display cabinet in the Perandus manor.
![[Cadiro Perandus - CadiroDemigodUnique2A.ogg]]

#### Cadiro
My name is Cadiro Perandus, Lord of the Coin and the former Minister of Finance. There was a time when I had grown enormously comfortable in my opulence and influence; but alas, my fortunes were snatched away by the cruel hands of fate... stashed away in troves to evade the prying hands of Voll, the Usurper, and scattered hither and thither during that frightful Cataclysm. I have made every attempt to recover the lost caches of the Perandus family, with a substantial degree of success... thankfully, for I must appease the Lord of the Underworld to stay alive.
![[Cadiro Perandus - Cadiro.ogg]]

#### Prospero_2
It has been over two hundred years since I signed a contract with Prospero – a deal which has prolonged my contented existence considerably. He was our household god, and our family paid homage to him in a tokenistic manner. It's one thing to make an offering here and there, or bat tithes in his general direction, but it's quite another to devote oneself utterly to his cause. I cannot imagine a life devoid of a partnership with him. Indeed, it would not exist. And I am all the happier for it... although it does come at a price.
![[Cadiro Perandus - Prospero_2.ogg]]

#### The Perandus Family_2
Once, the Perandus Family presided over the city of Sarn. Our presence in Sarn began as a handful of merchant stalls. We were an affluent family, and accrued more wealth readily, but little did we know that our influence would one day expand into an Empire... although Chitus did have his sights set on the throne from a very early age. And, dare I say it myself, he could not have ascended to power without my assistance.
![[Cadiro Perandus - The Perandus Family_2.ogg]]

#### Chitus
I nurtured that little tyke from cradle to the grave. I was closer to him even than his parents were. When he took the throne, I couldn't have been prouder... except, perhaps, for the day when he successfully navigated the Lord's Labyrinth. He was the first person to ever do it, too. And I was indispensable to his success.
![[Cadiro Perandus - Chitus.ogg]]

#### Niko
It's a shame how the sulphite has addled his brain so irreparably. We have a thing or two in common, given that he resides in the mines, which fall under Prospero's domain. I do wonder if he ever encountered the god himself.
![[Cadiro Perandus - Niko.ogg]]

#### Introduction_2
Ah, I was hoping it was you Prospero was sending me to do business with! He only mentioned a Duelist, not that I would be getting the best of the best, Oriath's greatest showman! I made a fortune dealing in bets on you. Not on your fights, mind you, but on which noblewoman you would bed next, and when you might finally get yourself exiled. Consider me your biggest fan.
![[Cadiro Perandus - Introduction_2.ogg]]

#### Introduction_3
It's been many years since I did business with a member of the Brotherhood of Silence. Oh, sore spot? This hideout doesn't exactly look as opulent as those dens of old, so I assume you have had a falling out with your fellows. This place will do, however, as long as our dealings remain profitable.
![[Cadiro Perandus - Introduction_3.ogg]]

#### Introduction_4
It's rare that I've done business with a Karui. Your people and mine often had... less than diplomatic encounters. Personally, I believe each man should be free to seek profit on his own merits. I'm happy to set up shop here and support your pursuits.
![[Cadiro Perandus - Introduction_4.ogg]]

#### Introduction_5
I don't know what deal you've made with Prospero to get me sent here, Witch, but I'll have you know that your dark powers will not work on me. My prices are not open to haggling or negotiation, no matter your... charms. Ahem.
![[Cadiro Perandus - Introduction_5.ogg]]

#### Introduction_6
You're the one Prospero sent me to do business with, Ranger? You seem like the last person who might be interested in partaking in civilised trading. Oh well, treasure is treasure. Let's make a deal.
![[Cadiro Perandus - Introduction_6.ogg]]

#### Introduction_7
This must be a cruel joke on Prospero's part, sending me here to do business with a Templar! It was your kind that visited misery upon my line, and ended the otherwise 'Eternal' Empire. Though I suppose if you've been exiled, you hardly support those who would emulate Malachai... perhaps we can deal with each other cordially after all.
![[Cadiro Perandus - Introduction_7.ogg]]

#### Introduction_8
A woman of noble bearing and talent such as yours, exiled? Simply unthinkable. I am happy to set up shop here and do business with you, my lady. I have a feeling we shall get along famously.
![[Cadiro Perandus - Introduction_8.ogg]]

#### Alva
That woman has a lust for gold that matches even my own. A shame about our multi-century age gap. She would have made a worthy Perandus wife.
![[Cadiro Perandus - Alva.ogg]]

#### Einhar
How do you know the Wandering Ezomyte? That strange man poached a few exotic animals from Perandus estates. Our soldiers never could track him down. Eventually, I just gave up and wrote off the losses. I'm rather astounded to see him still on the hunt...
![[Cadiro Perandus - Einhar.ogg]]

#### Tane
Poor fool. A rare learned Karui, but still so misguided. There is only one Intrinsic Darkness in the heart of man, exile, and you and I know it well... Greed.
![[Cadiro Perandus - Tane.ogg]]

#### Jun
She is an enemy of the Perandus family. I do not care to discuss her.
![[Cadiro Perandus - Jun.ogg]]

#### Zana
I do business with her as well, but she has asked me to keep those dealings private for now...
![[Cadiro Perandus - Zana.ogg]]
