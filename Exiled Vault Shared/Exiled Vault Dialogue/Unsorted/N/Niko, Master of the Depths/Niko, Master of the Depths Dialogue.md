## Niko, Master of the Depths Dialogue
#### Introduction
Seems like the rain's brought out a few worms! Don't think I'm an easy mark, exile. I've spent more than enough time around exiles to know which way the dagger's pointing, and I'll happily give it a shove in your direction if you try anything... wormy. I'm conducting a little dig... The sort of enterprise that could make someone with your particular 'skill set' a very handsome living. Don't worry, you'll not be moving much dirt. No, no... Why smash rocks when you could smash skulls, eh?
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Introduction.ogg]]

#### NikoFindFirstOre
Before I can take you to my mining operation I need a little something from you. Mining's dangerous at the best of times, but it's suicidal without a proper source of light. I've got lights, just ain't got no power. Run on Voltaxic Sulphite, they do. Nasty rocks. Stink like a dozen eggs rotting in the summer sun on the back of a whale carcass, and they're less stable than the High Templar on a bad day. Bloody toxic too. I can smell some nearby, actually. How 'bout you follow your nose and find it, eh?
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - NikoFindFirstOre.ogg]]

#### Voltaxic Sulphite
Ah, this is the stuff. Good nose, exile. You find more and I'll come right over. Don't touch it though. Stuff'll send you mad without the right precautions. You think I want to be dressed like this? Tell you what - how about we take a look around my mine. Talk to me when you're ready to go.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Voltaxic Sulphite.ogg]]

#### The Azurite Mine
Looks like shite, eh? Well, don't judge a mine by its entrance. Eternals used to pull all sorts of goodies out of these rocks, and they never had my secret weapon. Just inside the mineshaft is my creaky little Crawler. Took one of the ol' Eternal torture devices and... repurposed it. Oh, it can still tear your skin off like peeling a fruit, but hopefully it won't try to. Instead, it can lay down a daisy chain of lights powered by that Voltaxic Sulphite. You'll want to be on the lookout for more of that, mind you. This big beauty next to me? My pride and joy. Feeds Crawler with refined and purified sulphite. And it's capable of taking all sorts of the raw materials strewn below ground and turning 'em into sources of light and explosives. How 'bout you head underground and follow the mechanical little bugger to an azurite vein, eh?
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - The Azurite Mine.ogg]]

#### The Crawler
This is Crawler. Capable of scouting out a few of the valuables hidden down here, but needs your muscle to get to 'em. Tell it where you want to go, and try to stay alive 'til you get there. Crawler will burn through sulphite on the way, and we ain't made of sulphite, so choose carefully. How about you follow it to a nearby Azurite vein, eh? Make sure you stick near Crawler's light. Believe me... you don't want to get dragged into the darkness.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - The Crawler.ogg]]

#### Flares and Dynamite
Beauty. Look at it sparkle. Glows like blue embers in the dark. My machine here can turn these rocks into something a little more useful. You might need some extra light down there, so how 'bout you put a few flares together. Mine's also full of dead ends and things that oughta be dead themselves, so get a blasting stick while you're at it. Should have enough for both on ya.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Flares and Dynamite.ogg]]

#### Fractured Walls
Hot little pair of sticks you got. Mind you don't get 'em mixed up. Don't want to have to mop you up... though I suppose blowing yourself to bits is better than getting lost in the dark down there. I suggest you bring a few sticks of dynamite and a few flares when you venture down there. Crawler will guide you to some large ore veins, but tossing a flare into the gloom might reveal some very pretty little treasures. Since the mine's been around for so long, all the easy pickings have already been pinched. Might have to do some excavating of your own if you want something truly precious. There're some fragile-looking walls down there. Reckon a well-placed stick of dynamite will turn those walls to rubble. Why don't you give that a go, eh? I'll let you keep whatever you find on the other side.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Fractured Walls.ogg]]

#### The Azurite Mine_2
Not the prettiest spot in Wraeclast, but relatively dry and safe as long as you stay in the light. Never cared about a good view anyway. Much prefer a cozy spot indoors. Not many of those on Wraeclast that aren't filled with bloody flesheaters though, eh?
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - The Azurite Mine_2.ogg]]

#### Fractured Walls_2
Blew up a wall, did you? And you're back in one piece! Impressive. Hope you found something nice on the other side. Well, exile, that's all there really is to it. Simple, really. So... bugger off to find more ore for us, eh?
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Fractured Walls_2.ogg]]

#### NikoClaimOreFirstRandom
Good find, exile.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - NikoClaimOreFirstRandom.ogg]]

#### Invite to Hideout
This'll do nicely, exile.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Invite to Hideout.ogg]]

#### NikoClaimOreFirst6
Another good find.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - NikoClaimOreFirst6.ogg]]

#### The Darkness
The darkness within those walls is unnatural. It does not fade in the presence of light... It retreats. Like a living beast. I'd not wander too far from the lamps if I were you.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - The Darkness.ogg]]

#### Voltaxic Sulphite_2
Used to mine the stuff for the Templar. Dunno why they needed all that power. Didn't really care to find out, neither. Less I know about their business, the better. Stopped mining it for a while when my brain turned to mush. Heard and saw things that weren't really there. All better now, though.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Voltaxic Sulphite_2.ogg]]

#### Oriath
Grew up in Oriath. Used to love the city... Spent my youth combing the woods around it for Sulphite. No one else knew how to handle the stuff, but the Templar had a voracious appetite for it. Needed it to power whatever god-forsaken machines they were building. Made a very healthy living for myself until... Well, let's just say, for a while I thought I was a... a prophet. The Templar don't take so kindly to people calling themselves prophets. Locked me up in a madhouse, but I dug my way out. The Templar like escapees even less than they like false prophets, so here I am, digging around in Eternal rubble.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Oriath.ogg]]

#### Voltaxic Generator
Been working on this machine on and off for years. Hard to really test it without the raw materials from the mine. You're here now, though, so maybe that'll change. This beauty can take the azurite you find in there and turn it into flares and dynamite. Enough azurite, and I can make this thing more efficient than it already is. Able to hold a lot more sulphite, and able to make better flares and dynamite.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Voltaxic Generator.ogg]]

#### Underground Cities
Whole Eternal Empire was built on the ruins of the Vaal, so it ain't surprising that we'd run up against Vaal ruins down there. Seen some other traces, though. People who weren't Eternals or Vaal. Thought I'd just hit an old Vaal burial ground, 'til I realised just how many bones there were... and that they were used to build. Ain't a historian, but never heard of the Vaal using human bones to make buildings.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Underground Cities.ogg]]

#### Prospero
Piles of gold, eh? Ain't a goldmine, so sounds like you stumbled across an old shrine to Prospero. Any miner worth his rocksalt knows Prospero. Might've even tried to make a deal with him for riches or life. Prospero's followers think the two are more or less interchangeable. If you believe in that stuff, I've got a flying rhoa to sell you.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Prospero.ogg]]

#### Voltaxic Generator_2
Beautiful find, Exile. Generator's full-up though. Might be a good time to go for a dig, eh?
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Voltaxic Generator_2.ogg]]

#### The Azurite Mine_3
Huh... Thought I heard you in there earlier. Went to check because I didn't see you, and sure enough, you weren't there. Could've sworn I heard something down there in the shafts though.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - The Azurite Mine_3.ogg]]

#### NikoClaimOreSecondRandom
This... This is good stuff.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - NikoClaimOreSecondRandom.ogg]]

#### NikoClaimOreSecond3
Packed with energy, exile. Packed with energy.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - NikoClaimOreSecond3.ogg]]

#### NikoClaimOreSecond5
Another nice vein eh? Heheh.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - NikoClaimOreSecond5.ogg]]

#### NikoClaimOreSecond7
Whew. Whiff that.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - NikoClaimOreSecond7.ogg]]

#### The Darkness_2
The deeper we go, the more the darkness scares me. I've seen nothing like it before, and I hope to see nothing like it again. Stay in the light, exile, unless you wish to die.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - The Darkness_2.ogg]]

#### Voltaxic Sulphite_3
You'll get used to the smell after a bit. Might even start to miss it. Curious rock, that sulphite. Only found near the surface. Can't think of any other rock quite like it. Its... interesting properties make it tricky to handle. Not many people want or need it. Not many people can stomach the smell. Kept me in business for a good long while 'til I ended up in the madhouse. Mostly better now, though. Mostly.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Voltaxic Sulphite_3.ogg]]

#### Voltaxic Generator_3
Impressive ain't she? It's where Crawler gets its power, and what keeps the lights down there lit. Find some Azurite down there, you can toss it in this, and out comes something a little more deadly. Or bright, if that's your style.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Voltaxic Generator_3.ogg]]

#### Oriath_2
If you knew how to handle Voltaxic Sulphite without blowing your arms off, you could make a lot of money in Oriath. As you can see, I still have my arms. Sold piles of Sulphite to the Templar. Knew better than to ask what they needed it for. But when people who weren't really there started talking to me, I didn't know better than to ask the Templar for help. Ever break out of a Templar-run mental-asylum? Easier than ya think. Easier than hiding from the Templar when they go looking for ya. They shipped me off to Wraeclast as soon as they found me. Easier to forget I exist than to help me get rid of the voices, eh?
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Oriath_2.ogg]]

#### Underground Cities_2
Don't be surprised if you find yourself surrounded by Vaal ruins when you get deep enough. Whole Eternal Empire was built on their ruins. Might even see some of their cursed dead wandering the halls. But if you see... other ruins... best watch yourself. Nothin' collects that many bones peacefully.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Underground Cities_2.ogg]]

#### Prospero_2
Thought most of the old cults died with the Eternal Empire, but it sounds like you found a shrine to Prospero. He was supposedly in charge of all things that came out of the earth. Miners left him tributes. Guess they were hoping Prospero would protect them from a cave-in. Or an explosion. Or toxic gases. Have I mentioned how dangerous this job is?
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Prospero_2.ogg]]

#### Voltaxic Generator_4
Plenty of energy in this one, but the generator is at capacity. How about you visit the mine?
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Voltaxic Generator_4.ogg]]

#### The Azurite Mine_4
I think they're back, exile. The voices. I can hear them talking to me down there. Just whispers, here and there. Whispers, and scratching. Like they're buried somewhere deep. Can't make out any words, but I can feel their emotions. They're not happy. Not happy at all.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - The Azurite Mine_4.ogg]]

#### NikoClaimOreThirdRandom
Heheheh... Good eye, exile...
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - NikoClaimOreThirdRandom.ogg]]

#### NikoClaimOreThird4
Food for the machine, heheh!
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - NikoClaimOreThird4.ogg]]

#### NikoClaimOreThird6
Pretty little rocks, just for me...
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - NikoClaimOreThird6.ogg]]

#### The Darkness_3
It's out there, exile. Watching us. It's all around us. Can you feel it? The darkness wants our flesh. Wants to devour us like all that came before. Something is fuelling it. Something... Or someone.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - The Darkness_3.ogg]]

#### Voltaxic Sulphite_4
Love the stuff, really. The weight, the roughness... The way it makes my hands and brain tingle, like they're covered in hundreds of tiny little ants. Need more and more to keep the lights in the mine going, which is fine by me.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Voltaxic Sulphite_4.ogg]]

#### Voltaxic Generator_5
With the right materials, you can make some very nice things with my machine. Put a lot of work into making it do what it does. Honestly... Think someone's been tampering with it. Might be trying to steal my designs. Over my dead and rotting body, eh?
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Voltaxic Generator_5.ogg]]

#### Oriath_3
Probably heard about all the weird experiments the Templar were doin' back in Oriath, eh? Probably seen some of the results around here. Need a lot of power to do something like that, I imagine... It just so happens I used to be the supplier of that power. Knew no one else who could handle Voltaxic Sulphite in Oriath. Made a lot of money selling the stuff to the Templar. When I started hearing things... people... I went to the Templar for help. Thought they'd do a favour for their favourite miner. Locked me up instead! Me! In a bloody mental asylum! Should've bought them off, but I dug out instead. Should've bought them off when they caught up to me and tried to ship me off to Wraeclast, but my head wasn't right. Still might not be.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Oriath_3.ogg]]

#### Underground Cities_3
You'll run across plenty of ruins down there. Eternal, Vaal, and... others. You'd know if you'd seen them. Bones everywhere. Walls of bones. Pillars. Piles and piles and piles. All different sizes. Child sized bones. The Vaal were bloody and merciless, but they were better than what came before. Went no deeper once I saw that. Wish I'd not gone that deep in the first place.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Underground Cities_3.ogg]]

#### Prospero_3
A dirty deal made deep in the dirt. That's what the gold piles down there mean. A bargain with the God of Wealth and the Underworld, Prospero. That it remains there is proof that Prospero is no more. Or... maybe the offering was recent. Hope you left it undisturbed. Wouldn't want to tempt a god's wrath, would you? Eh?
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Prospero_3.ogg]]

#### Voltaxic Generator_6
No room for this right now with the generator as full as it is, but better I take it than someone else.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Voltaxic Generator_6.ogg]]

#### The Azurite Mine_5
Layers on layers on layers. That's how we build. Sarn built over the ruins of the Vaal. The Vaal built over an abyss of bones. What's below the bones, exile? I can still hear them down there, rattling around, pawing at the rocks. They want out. Want what we have. Want to take our lives over. Want to take our minds over.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - The Azurite Mine_5.ogg]]

#### NikoClaimOreFourthRandom
Come, come, pretty little rocks.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - NikoClaimOreFourthRandom.ogg]]

#### NikoClaimOreFourth3
Gotta grab 'em before someone else does, eh?
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - NikoClaimOreFourth3.ogg]]

#### NikoClaimOreFourth5
Heheheheheheheheh...
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - NikoClaimOreFourth5.ogg]]

#### The Darkness_4
Can you hear them, exile? They're locked away down there. The darkness has them imprisoned... Bait, trying to coax us out of the light. But we're not so dumb, are we, exile? No no no... We'll not be lured into the darkness so easily.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - The Darkness_4.ogg]]

#### Voltaxic Sulphite_5
Been a long time since I was around this much sulphite. Forgot how it made me feel. Strong! But... Forgot how many others want it. How loud they are. They're after it. Might try to kill me to get it. Tear me apart, squeeze the dust from my skin. Might try to do the same to you, exile.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Voltaxic Sulphite_5.ogg]]

#### Voltaxic Generator_7
Tell me, what do you think is worth more: this machine, or the power and light it can create? Suppose you know the answer already. Wouldn't be stupid enough to try and take it from me, would they? Couldn't use it even if they did. Needs azurite ores, and they're deep in the darkness. Even they'd not be stupid enough to wander in there... Ha! Love to see them try.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Voltaxic Generator_7.ogg]]

#### Oriath_4
Made myself very rich selling Voltaxic Sulphite to the Templar. Didn't know what they were doing with it, but it wasn't hard to guess. Was a couple years ago that I started hearing... them. The voices. Talking to me. Telling me things about the people around me. Things I shouldn't know. Secrets. Wonderful, violent secrets. Went to the Templar and told 'em what I knew. What I was getting told. Who was telling it. Templar didn't bloody believe me. Locked me up in a... in a prison! But my little messenger told me how to escape. Told me to dig. Dig, dig, dig. Dug my way to freedom. Templar didn't like that, no no. Sent an army after me. Tossed me on a slaver's ship and sent me to Wraeclast to rot. But I'm not rotting, am I, exile? I'm healthier than I've ever been, heheheh.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Oriath_4.ogg]]

#### Underground Cities_4
Can you hear 'em walking around down there? The Vaal, holed up in their ruins, still scrabbling at the walls and floors. Empire's been dead for thousands of years, but they ain't. Not dead enough for me, anyway. They're below us, but what's below them? I know... Can you hear them rattling their bones, exile? Beckoning us deeper and deeper, into their pit of bones? What's below the bones, exile? What's below the bones?
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Underground Cities_4.ogg]]

#### Prospero_4
Tried to make a trade with Prospero, they did. That's why you saw gold down there. Someone wanted to avoid a dark fate. Gave away all their wealth. But it's still there, so... the God of Wealth must be full-up. Or the god never existed. Bunch of myths and stories to scare children and sap money from the mad and stupid. I'm not stupid though, am I? No... Not stupid.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Prospero_4.ogg]]

#### Voltaxic Generator_8
Trying to overload the generator, are ya? Thing's full-up. Full to the tippy top! How about you use some of this sulphite we've collected.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Voltaxic Generator_8.ogg]]

#### The Azurite Mine_6
Got to keep digging, exile. Got to keep digging! Need to let them out. Need to stop the chatter. They're too loud, exile. And they're all angry. Shouting at us. Can't understand a word. Probably get more done if they would be quiet for just one moment. How do you stand the noise, exile? Can't even think with the bloody racket they're making. Wish someone would make 'em... disappear.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - The Azurite Mine_6.ogg]]

#### NikoClaimOreFifthRandom
We need more of this, exile. A lot more.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - NikoClaimOreFifthRandom.ogg]]

#### NikoClaimOreFifth3
More, exile. Go find more.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - NikoClaimOreFifth3.ogg]]

#### NikoClaimOreFifth5
Quickly, Niko, quickly... they're waiting!
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - NikoClaimOreFifth5.ogg]]

#### NikoClaimOreFifth7
Good good good good.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - NikoClaimOreFifth7.ogg]]

#### The Darkness_5
They're calling us... They're calling us again, exile. And we have to answer. Need to get to them. Free them. They need us, exile. You need to hurry. The darkness is crowding around us, exile. It's so hungry. It licks at our minds, tasting our fear. Lick lick lick! Only a taste though, exile. Only a taste for now.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - The Darkness_5.ogg]]

#### Voltaxic Sulphite_6
They're definitely after it, exile. Want our pretty little rocks. Circling us like a pack of wolves. Like the darkness deep down in the mine. They want to swallow us both up and take our rocks. But we will have the last laugh. "HA!" We'll say. HA! HA! The sulphite's ours. Pumping light into the darkness with our pretty little rocks. Carrying us deeper and deeper into the unknown and unknowable. Closer and closer... to them.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Voltaxic Sulphite_6.ogg]]

#### Voltaxic Generator_9
Machine's worth more than my life. Or yours, should it come to that, exile. No man or woman alive today could replicate it. They'll try, though. Oh, they'll try. They'll crack her open like an egg. Let her goo run across the ground and back into the mines. Back into the darkness. Gobbled up. Won't let that happen. Would kill anyone who tries to take her in a heartbeat. Even you, exile. Even you.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Voltaxic Generator_9.ogg]]

#### Oriath_5
Heheheh, they thought they could put ol' Niko to rest. Thought I'd die out here. Thought I'd keep the Templar's dirty little secret to myself! But I'm still breathin'. Still digging their beautiful rocks out of the ground, just like I was back in Oriath. But they ain't getting a single. Bloody. One. They thought they'd lock me away from the angry voices in that dark room, but I got out. Ran through the square in my bloody prison garb. Hands bleeding everywhere. Must've tracked my blood to find me. Couldn't kill me though, could they. Had to send me to the cursed continent to die. Think they're still trying to get me, exile? Sending their ugly little spies my way? Maybe we'll feed them to the darkness.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Oriath_5.ogg]]

#### Underground Cities_5
Eternal relics on Vaal ruins. Vaal ruins on a living graveyard. Down and down and down. Layers and layers. Years and years. Never stopped building up so we never stop digging down, eh? Only a matter of time until we're buried too, exile. What secrets will be buried with us? What secrets remain to be dug up? heeheehee... I know a secret, exile. Do you?
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Underground Cities_5.ogg]]

#### Prospero_5
What good is gold to the dead? Can't spend if you can't move or breath. Can't line the pockets of your betters, can you? Prospero, God of the Shining Rocks! He'll keep you alive down there... for a price. That's what they say, anyway. That's what they keep saying. Keep telling me to give more. Give away my beauties. But what do I get for it? Can't prove I didn't die already, can they? Can't prove we're not all already dead! Until I'm dead, the rocks are mine. Prospero can come and get them if he wants them so badly... Heheheheheh... Wonder what the blood of a god tastes like.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Prospero_5.ogg]]

#### Voltaxic Generator_10
Lovely sulphite, all for me. Brimming with sulphite already, the generator is. Couldn't fit more if I wanted to! Come and see, exile! Come and see!
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Voltaxic Generator_10.ogg]]

#### Light Radius
Deeper you go, the more claustrophobic it feels. Like the darkness is closing in. Might be, exile. Might be trying to strangle ya. Might be time we try to squeeze a little more juice out of those lights. If you've got any Azurite spare, could be worth upgrading the lights at the generator.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Light Radius.ogg]]

#### Darkness Resistance
The depths you're exploring are dangerous, exile. Not talking about the bloody monsters - if you stray into the darkness in your state, you'll be torn to shreds. Reckon you should use a little Azurite to insulate yourself from the darkness. Won't completely protect you, but... well, you won't die quite so fast. Generator ought to be able to take care of it for you, if you have the ore. Well... Go on.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Darkness Resistance.ogg]]

#### The Azurite Mine_7
Beauty. Look at it sparkle. Glows like blue embers in the dark. My machine here can turn these rocks into something a little more useful, but you'll need more than you've currently got. Come back once you've found more Azurite, eh?
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - The Azurite Mine_7.ogg]]

#### Talk to Niko
Eh? Oh. I'm busy right now.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Talk to Niko.ogg]]

#### Light Radius_2
Thought I was imagining things the first time I saw it. The darkness... squeezing in. Wish I was just imagining it, but... The deeper you go, the harder it squeezes. You oughta put some of your azurite towards making our lights a bit brighter at the generator.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Light Radius_2.ogg]]

#### Darkness Resistance_2
Wasn't long ago I went too deep into the mine too quickly. Chasing glittering riches, I was. Lost track of me light. Strayed into the dark. Felt as if my skin was being eaten from the inside of my body. I was lucky to make it back. The deeper you go, the quicker the darkness will kill you. You need to insulate yourself at the generator. No amount of Azurite's worth your life.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Darkness Resistance_2.ogg]]

#### Light Radius_3
You've seen it. I know you have. The darkness deep down there... it's growing stronger. Squeezing the light. Can't survive without the light though, can ya? Need to give it a kick up the arse. Use some of the azurite you've collected to make the lights shine brighter, else you'll have no room to bloody move.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Light Radius_3.ogg]]

#### Darkness Resistance_3
It's angry now, exile. The darkness is angry. Angry that you are walking among it, alive. It wants you dead, and the deeper you go, the stronger it gets. Don't let it get you. Use some azurite at the generator to insulate yourself from it. Didn't hire you just to feed you to the bloody darkness.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Darkness Resistance_3.ogg]]

#### Light Radius_4
You've done it now, exile. You've really done it now. Look how the darkness crowds around the light, waiting to pounce on you. The deeper you go, the stronger it gets. Pushes in towards the light. Only one way to fight back, exile. More light. Brighter light! Upgrade it at the generator with your ore. See how the darkness feels about that, eh? Heheheheh.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Light Radius_4.ogg]]

#### Darkness Resistance_4
Look at yourself. Think you're ready to face whatever lies deeper in those mines, do ya? Think the equipment you're wearing will keep you alive? Ha! The darkness will eat right through that. It's strong, exile. Stronger than you. Only thing that might keep you standing is using some azurite to insulate yourself. I'd do that if I were you. Generator can take care of it for ya. Or if you'd rather, you can just submit to the darkness like all the others, heheheheh.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Darkness Resistance_4.ogg]]

#### Light Radius_5
The darkness is coming for you, exile. The deeper you go, the stronger it pushes in towards the light. Can't stop it, either. Can only slow it down by making the lights shine brighter. Brighter and brighter they shine with the generator's help. Will it be enough? No way of knowing!
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Light Radius_5.ogg]]

#### Darkness Resistance_5
Felt the sting of the hungering gloom yet? All in due time. It's hungrier than it has ever been, the darkness. Hungrier than it's ever been, and there's nothing that will sate it. You can only try to make yourself taste rotten to it. Use some of your ore at the generator, and maybe, just maybe, you'll live a little longer. Heheheh.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Darkness Resistance_5.ogg]]

#### NikoMysteriousMan
You... didn't happen to see him did you? Masked man, reeking of blood and beasts. Walked right up to me. Told me the end was coming, like I didn't already know. Laughed right in his face. Called me stupid, so I left to get some dynamite... show him just how stupid I am. Only left for a moment but he was gone by the time I got back. He comes back, I'll be here. Ready for him. Boom! Hahahaha.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - NikoMysteriousMan.ogg]]

#### NikoDismissedFromHideout
See you later!
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - NikoDismissedFromHideout.ogg]]

#### NikoMineOpened
Oooooooh! Look at that!

#### The Mines
Hey, mate, what's going on? Came all the way here to see what's what in this famous mine, but there's a bloody big glowing wall blocking it. Can't squeeze through!
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - The Mines.ogg]]

#### Voltaxic Sulphite_7
See that? One moment, big blades, next moment, gone! Should be able to go in there now. Heard this place reeked of Voltaxic Sulphite back in the day. I was planning on having a wander down there, only... I think I can hear things shuffling around down there, and I'm more of a lover than a fighter. Actually, if you're headed in there, maybe you could do us a favour. See, I run a little mining operation of my own. Mining's dangerous at the best of times, but it's suicidal without a proper source of light. I've got lights, just ain't got no power. Run on Voltaxic Sulphite, they do. Nasty rocks. Stink like a dozen eggs rotting in the summer sun on the back of a whale carcass, and they're less stable than the High Templar on a bad day. Bloody toxic too. Keep your nostrils peeled for some Voltaxic Sulphite while you're down there, or anywhere really.

#### BetrayalNikoVeinOutOfTown
My, my! Good nose, exile. Know what you've found here? This is Voltaxic Sulphite. My name's Niko and I run a little mining operation of my own. Mining's dangerous at the best of times, but it's suicidal without a proper source of light. I've got lights, just ain't got no power. Run on Voltaxic Sulphite, they do. Nasty rocks. Stink like a dozen eggs rotting in the summer sun on the back of a whale carcass, and they're less stable than the High Templar on a bad day. Bloody toxic too. You find more and I'll come right over. Don't touch it though. Stuff'll send you mad without the right precautions. You think I want to be dressed like this? Tell you what - how about we take a look around my mine.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - BetrayalNikoVeinOutOfTown.ogg]]

#### Introduction_2
Quite liked it here, you know, right up until the bloody mountainside started bloody... well... bleedin'. Thought for sure I was hallucinating, 'til the others started screaming and scrambling. Always nice to get a little reassurance about your sanity, eh?
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Introduction_2.ogg]]

#### Introduction_3
Well, this nice little outpost here's been, shall we say, marred. Don't get me wrong, I love a splash of colour, I just don't love that colour splashing on me and my friends here. Why do I get the feeling you were involved...?
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Introduction_3.ogg]]

#### Introduction_4
Blood everywhere around here... Startin' to remind me of my time in that little room back in Oriath. All that digging really made a mess of me hands. The mitts ain't just for protecting me against the sulphite you know.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Introduction_4.ogg]]

#### Introduction_5
How can there be this much blood, exile? Where's it coming from? Where's it going? Know what I think? I think it's going back into the mountain. One big loop, exile. One bloody big loop, and someone's down there pumpin it.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Introduction_5.ogg]]

#### Introduction_6
This is a bad omen, exile. A real baaaad sign. What if all the water's turning to blood, eh? They say the Cataclysm did all sorts of strange things. This seems pretty strange to me! Been having a lot of dreams where I drink all that blood up. My body swells up like a big grape. Can't hold it in. BANG! I'm gone. What do you think that means, eh? Maybe I'm the only one who can stop it... Maybe I'm the reason it's here in the first place.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Introduction_6.ogg]]

#### Alva
I'm plenty familiar with her type. Sniffin' around for treasure but doing anything they can to make sure it's not their own nose that gets dirty. No thank you.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Alva.ogg]]

#### Alva_2
I know 'er, sure. Don't care much for her. She's the type of person that gets others to do the hard work. Rather just do me own work, thank you.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Alva_2.ogg]]

#### Alva_3
Seen her sniffin' around my mine... Reckon she was looking for some unguarded goods. Lucky for me I own nothing of value!
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Alva_3.ogg]]

#### Alva_4
Oh yes... The time traveller. Says she can go back in time. Must mean she's from the future, eh? Yet when I asked her what I was gonna do next, she couldn't tell me. Very suspicious.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Alva_4.ogg]]

#### Alva_5
That girl... She's been eyeing my machine. I know she's after it. Greedy little-... She can't have it. Can't even touch it. She tries, and I'll bury her alive.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Alva_5.ogg]]

#### Jun
Somethin' about masks just put me on the defensive. Probably has something to do with my less-than-pleasant run-ins with the Templar. But she seems like an alright sort. Not exactly one to mess with, what with those bloody big blades of hers.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Jun.ogg]]

#### Jun_2
She's hiding her face, but her eyes tell you everything you need to know, don't they. Curious. A thinker. The type of person who looks you in the eye but sees every other movement too. Dangerous.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Jun_2.ogg]]

#### Jun_3
The thing about her is... she's so... normal. It's like she's trying to blend in so hard that she sticks out. Suspicious if you ask me... very, very suspicious. Not that I'd tell her that. I've seen what she can do with a knife.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Jun_3.ogg]]

#### Jun_4
Ooooh, she's up to something. Nobody with those darty little eyes and massive blades is completely innocent. Dunno what she's hidin', but I'm sure I'll find out soon enough.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Jun_4.ogg]]

#### Jun_5
Nice girl, she is. Very nice indeed. Too nice. Whatever it is she's hiding with that little performance, its big, exile. Big and heavy. A boulder-sized secret that threatens to sink our nice little ship.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Jun_5.ogg]]

#### Einhar
Einhar... Bloody Einhar won't leave me alone! "We are best friends yes? We will survive the bloody first ones yes?" No, Einhar, none of that is true and you're bloody crazy. And wash yourself once in a bloody while, will ya!
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Einhar.ogg]]

#### Einhar_2
That Einhar keeps lugging skins and organs over to me, like they're bloody gifts. What am I supposed to do with half a hellion kidney, Einhar? Eh? I don't want it. No one wants it. No one wants you. Just stay in your little zoo!
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Einhar_2.ogg]]

#### Einhar_3
You know, me and him have spent a little time together now, and I must say... I really don't like him. He smells and he talks too much. I told him to piss off and he laughed and slapped me on the back! I wasn't bloody joking.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Einhar_3.ogg]]

#### Einhar_4
Einhar's a bloody lunatic. But you know what? He's growing on me. I don't want to actively hit him in the face with a rock, so that's something. Weird thing is, when he's not around, I still hear his laugh. Or someone's laugh... Might be my laugh.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Einhar_4.ogg]]

#### Einhar_5
My beasty mate. What a guy. Heck of a shot. Loves a laugh. Rips animals apart and brings me all sorts of odd giblets. Can't believe I used to hate him! Dunno what changed if I'm honest, but since we're all stuck together, I ain't complaining.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Einhar_5.ogg]]

#### Zana
Zana's bright. Brighter than anyone else I can think of, actually, and since I live surrounded by literal darkness, I know a thing or two about bright. When I hit a wall with my own machinery, she's the one I talk to.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Zana.ogg]]

#### Zana_2
There aren't many people worthy of praise left in this world, but Zana is one of them. She outwitted the Templar, built a magnificent device, and hasn't tried to kill anyone in front of me yet. A rare gem indeed.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Zana_2.ogg]]

#### Zana_3
Clever and ambitious, that Zana. And with a kind heart! That's a particularly rare find in this day and age. Still... I can't shake the feeling there's something she's not telling me. Something... important.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Zana_3.ogg]]

#### Zana_4
Zana's hiding something. She's very clever, so it's not obvious, but I've seen her... fidgeting. And fretting. What is there to fret about? Something she hasn't told us, that's what. She's lucky I like her...
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Zana_4.ogg]]

#### Zana_5
Shh. Don't want her hearing. I think she's found something she doesn't want the rest of us to know about. Know what I think it is?... That's right, exile... another mine. A secret load of Azurite. And she's keeping it all for herself. But her secret's safe with me! ...err... Us, I guess.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Zana_5.ogg]]

#### BetrayalNikoAboutNavali1
Dunno how I feel about Navali. Seems to me like the power to see the future could make someone very prosperous, but she's keeping tight-lipped about anything that could help me! Seems pretty selfish, if you ask me.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - BetrayalNikoAboutNavali1.ogg]]

#### BetrayalNikoAboutNavali2
I want to like Navali. I really do. But... did you know she's bloody undead?! I've seen what the undead can do, exile, and let me tell you, it's hard to trust someone who might eat your face at any moment.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - BetrayalNikoAboutNavali2.ogg]]

#### BetrayalNikoAboutNavali3
Sometimes Navali looks over at me and just... frowns. Not an angry frown, more like... pity? I know she's seeing my future... Doesn't exactly fill me with hope. If my future's looking grim, I'd quite frankly rather not know.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - BetrayalNikoAboutNavali3.ogg]]

#### BetrayalNikoAboutNavali4
How can Navali sit there, knowing what's going to happen to all of us, keeping those lips tightly sealed, eh? She knows exactly where and when each of us is going to die. That's creepy. And she won't bloody tell us? That's... evil.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - BetrayalNikoAboutNavali4.ogg]]

#### BetrayalNikoAboutNavali5
She knows too much, exile. Too much! And there's nothing we can do about it! Can't kill her, since she's already bloody dead. Can't make her tell us what she knows, because even if we know, we can't bloody do a thing to change it. What's the point? What's the point in anything!?
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - BetrayalNikoAboutNavali5.ogg]]

#### Helena
She's smart enough to know that the blackguards are bad news... Though she did join 'em in the first place. Well, we've all made bad decisions, eh? Couldn't have been easy deciding to leave 'em neither. They're not exactly the most forgiving lot.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Helena.ogg]]

#### Helena_2
Helena's a good egg. Her moral compass was a little bent, but Oriath'll do that to ya, as we both know all too well. Got a pretty good brain in her too. Not quite as knowledgeable as me about rocks, but who is, eh?
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Helena_2.ogg]]

#### Helena_3
Been thinkin' that maybe I oughta keep an eye on that girl. She seems pretty desperate to stay hidden. Gotta ask yourself why... She says she's worried about blackguards, but who knows how true that really is, eh?
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Helena_3.ogg]]

#### Helena_4
She says she's still on the run from the blackguards, but... how do we really know where her loyalties lie? Wish we could crack her head open and see what her brain's doing. She looks like a fighter though. Not really much of a fighter, myself. Just gonna keep an eye on her for now.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Helena_4.ogg]]

#### Helena_5
Helena... Clever, kind, polite... seems too good to be true, if you ask me. You ask me, I think it IS too good to be true. Reckon she's got some sinister plans... Oh, she hasn't done anything... untoward... yet, but why would she blow her cover like that, eh? No, she's biding her time. Well I'm biding mine too. Let's see who lasts longer. Let's just wait and see, eh?
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Helena_5.ogg]]

#### BetrayalNikoInviteToHideout
You got space for me? Do you?
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - BetrayalNikoInviteToHideout.ogg]]

#### BetrayalNikoDismissFromHideout
Cruel, exile. Very cruel.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - BetrayalNikoDismissFromHideout.ogg]]

#### NikoOnBreachOnslaught_SanityLevel4
Not too long ago, I came upon the telltale purple light that usually precedes a bit of demonic terror. Ol' Niko knew what to do, right? Just hide and wait it out. Thing is, it didn't fade like usual. The glow remained, and the demons crept about freely, more and more of them as the minutes wore on. Thought I was a goner for sure. Thankfully, I had some sulphite with me. Burned so brightly that a few of the fiends began to recoil, then catalysed an explosion. I was coated in soot and demon-giblets, running for my life. Wouldn't go back there, not even if you paid me. Voltaxic sulphite has saved my life many times over. There's a reason I hold the stuff in such high regard, heh.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - NikoOnBreachOnslaught_SanityLevel4.ogg]]

#### NikoOnBreachOnslaught_SanityLevel5
They're getting through, Exile. The demons! I saw them... when one hole rips into another, the whole tears apart... whole holes... holes within holes... but you know, they've been trying to get out for so very long. I had to see, had to know. The deeper I crept, the more it became their domain... Their domain!
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - NikoOnBreachOnslaught_SanityLevel5.ogg]]

#### NikoOnBreachMiniHands_SanityLevel4
At the behest of Kirac and his brigade, I found myself deep within the Atlas. I was minding my own business, as I usually do. And then I saw not one, but two... hands. Horrific, inhuman hands... At first, I thought it might be a mirage, but before I knew it, I was surrounded, and damn near gutted by one of them – which snapped me out of my reverie good and proper, heh. Then I realised there were hands popping up all over the place... and a deluge of demons coming for me. I had no choice but to run.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - NikoOnBreachMiniHands_SanityLevel4.ogg]]

#### NikoOnBreachMiniHands_SanityLevel5
They're forcing their way in, Exile. Demons pressing their faces against the skin of the world. They almost got me. Don't you see? They were pulled back... snapped back as their claws sliced the air and nicked my clothes. They're all around us! Countless hands, emerging from nowhere, more and more of them every moment!
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - NikoOnBreachMiniHands_SanityLevel5.ogg]]

#### NikoOnTormentedSpirits_SanityLevel4
I don't often go into the Atlas, but when I do, I'm there for one thing: sulphite. Mind you, it's not the most pleasant place to be, heh, especially not when the monsters are behaving... shall we say, erratically? They seemed to be possessed by unseen forces, and were spouting all kinds of gibberish. It was very... unnerving.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - NikoOnTormentedSpirits_SanityLevel4.ogg]]

#### NikoOnTormentedSpirits_SanityLevel5
There are many voices. Sometimes, they speak to the monsters... from inside. I saw a mania about them, a spectral light in the eyes, and I knew they were not normal. Tormented souls, screaming in the dark, heh... more and more of them, controlling the leaders, controlling those in charge... pulling the strings...
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - NikoOnTormentedSpirits_SanityLevel5.ogg]]

#### NikoOnBeyondMonsters_SanityLevel4
While traversing the far reaches of the Atlas, I came upon vast chasms that shone with a ruddy light. Strange creatures emerged; bizarre monstrosities, heh, emblazoned in unearthly fire. The flames smelt foul, as if these creatures had somehow managed to ignite pure sulphite and were wreathed in it. They began to chitter at me in discordant tones, haunting the very marrow of my bones. Reminded me of my days in the Templar asylum. I knew I had to run...
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - NikoOnBeyondMonsters_SanityLevel4.ogg]]

#### NikoOnBeyondMonsters_SanityLevel5
There were vast chasms of ghastly light... monstrosities poured forth. Bizarre. Bizarre! They wanted to eat me, Exile. I saw them, and they saw me, and they swarmed after me. You know what they really are, don't ya? It's obvious. That's why we have to be careful...
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - NikoOnBeyondMonsters_SanityLevel5.ogg]]

#### Kirac
Kirac's a good egg, don't get me wrong. I just think it's mighty suspicious... nope, nope. I'm here because I want to help out. I have to remember that, heh. I have bad thoughts sometimes. I can usually tell the difference between the voices and my own thoughts, but spending time in the Atlas makes everything feel surreal. All I know is, there are good people here, and I want to do my part. Kirac's been kind to me.
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Kirac.ogg]]

#### Kirac_2
Have you ever noticed Kirac doesn't go into the Atlas himself anymore? He's more than happy to send us all into danger from the safety of his base. He never leaves it, in fact. Have you seen the explosives lining the place? I bet he's planning something. He bloody well might just blow us all up if we refuse to do his bidding, ohoho! Hush, hush, he might hear us... can't let him know we're onto him... just keep acting like everything's normal, right? Everything's normal, Exile...
![[Niko, Master of the Depths - Kirac_2.ogg]]
