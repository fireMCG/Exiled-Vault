## Nenet, the Scout Dialogue
#### IntroductionNenetNenetToExile
I am Nenet.

#### IntroductionNenetNenetToExileTwo
I can see a man's heart beat its last from a distance of two thrown stones.

#### EntryBanterTullinaNenetReply
The dead own nothing and feel nothing.
![[Nenet, the Scout - EntryBanterTullinaNenetReply.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterNenetToTullina
Time passes through us like a ghost.
![[Nenet, the Scout - EntryBanterNenetToTullina.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterNenetToTullinaTwo
There is no speed great enough to escape death.
![[Nenet, the Scout - EntryBanterNenetToTullinaTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterTullinaNenetReply
By our unity, we escaped with our lives.
![[Nenet, the Scout - ExitBanterTullinaNenetReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterNenetToTullina
The snakes leave the rabbit's nest bare and barren.
![[Nenet, the Scout - ExitBanterNenetToTullina.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterNenetToTullinaTwo
I do not have a diary, and do not dare look for it!
![[Nenet, the Scout - ExitBanterNenetToTullinaTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTullinaNenetReply
We are to gain entry to this location and take everything we can carry.
![[Nenet, the Scout - SelectionBanterTullinaNenetReply.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTullinaNenetReplyTwo
Yes. The usual.
![[Nenet, the Scout - SelectionBanterTullinaNenetReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNenetToExile
I have answered your call.
![[Nenet, the Scout - SelectionBanterNenetToExile.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNenetToTullinaTwo
What business have we?
![[Nenet, the Scout - SelectionBanterNenetToTullinaTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNenetToTullinaThree
And the plans are complete?
![[Nenet, the Scout - SelectionBanterNenetToTullinaThree.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNenetToTullinaFour
Then I will watch in silence. Proceed.
![[Nenet, the Scout - SelectionBanterNenetToTullinaFour.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterNenetToAdiyah
Left any children to die lately, Maraketh?
![[Nenet, the Scout - ExitBanterNenetToAdiyah.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterNenetToAdiyahTwo
So you admit you are evil!
![[Nenet, the Scout - ExitBanterNenetToAdiyahTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterNenetToAdiyahThree
I'm not so certain.
![[Nenet, the Scout - ExitBanterNenetToAdiyahThree.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterAdiyahNenetReply
That's personal.
![[Nenet, the Scout - ExitBanterAdiyahNenetReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterAdiyahNenetReplyTwo
My own mother was willing to abandon me over it.
![[Nenet, the Scout - ExitBanterAdiyahNenetReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterTibbsNenetReply
I expect us all to die. Any better than that is a victory.
![[Nenet, the Scout - EntryBanterTibbsNenetReply.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterNenetToTibbs
There is death on the wind. Beware.
![[Nenet, the Scout - EntryBanterNenetToTibbs.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterTibbsNenetReply
The day is not done yet. Our 'friends' back home might backstab us to take our spoils.
![[Nenet, the Scout - ExitBanterTibbsNenetReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterNenetToTibbs
I believed we would face our deaths in there. I am glad to have been wrong.
![[Nenet, the Scout - ExitBanterNenetToTibbs.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterNenetToTibbsTwo
Painfully. Yes.
![[Nenet, the Scout - ExitBanterNenetToTibbsTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterNenetToTibbsThree
I did not see the need.
![[Nenet, the Scout - ExitBanterNenetToTibbsThree.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTibbsNenetReply
No. Early.
![[Nenet, the Scout - SelectionBanterTibbsNenetReply.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTibbsNenetReplyTwo
You worry about much. Why is that?
![[Nenet, the Scout - SelectionBanterTibbsNenetReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTibbsNenetReplyThree
I never worry, because the worst has already happened to me. This isn't even my life. It's just a shadow. Do you worry about stepping on your shadow?
![[Nenet, the Scout - SelectionBanterTibbsNenetReplyThree.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTibbsNenetReplyFour
Not my mother, that's for certain.
![[Nenet, the Scout - SelectionBanterTibbsNenetReplyFour.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNenetToTibbs
Selarim to all.
![[Nenet, the Scout - SelectionBanterNenetToTibbs.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNenetToTibbsTwo
I see you also, large man. These plans appear adequate.
![[Nenet, the Scout - SelectionBanterNenetToTibbsTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNenetToKuraiThree
Always for you, lady Kurai. It would be a great honour.
![[Nenet, the Scout - SelectionBanterNenetToKuraiThree.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNenetToTibbsFour
Mister Tibbs, do you ache in your large skeleton?
![[Nenet, the Scout - SelectionBanterNenetToTibbsFour.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNenetToTibbsFive
I will try.
![[Nenet, the Scout - SelectionBanterNenetToTibbsFive.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterKarstNenetReply
That you felt compelled to say this does not fill me with confidence.
![[Nenet, the Scout - EntryBanterKarstNenetReply.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterNenetToKarst
Clear skies. A good omen.
![[Nenet, the Scout - EntryBanterNenetToKarst.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterKarstNenetReply
I see everything. Flaws and all.
![[Nenet, the Scout - ExitBanterKarstNenetReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterNenetToKarst
Success, but still room for improvement.
![[Nenet, the Scout - ExitBanterNenetToKarst.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterKarstNenetReply
I greet you, thief.
![[Nenet, the Scout - SelectionBanterKarstNenetReply.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterKarstNenetReplyTwo
And your money, if you intend to cheat at cards against me.
![[Nenet, the Scout - SelectionBanterKarstNenetReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterKarstNenetReplyThree
You should have known, with my sharp eyes...
![[Nenet, the Scout - SelectionBanterKarstNenetReplyThree.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNenetToKarst
Warm greetings to all.
![[Nenet, the Scout - SelectionBanterNenetToKarst.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNenetToKurai
My apologies, Kurai. Karst despises me, but I do not care what he thinks, and that has caused him some emotional distress.
![[Nenet, the Scout - SelectionBanterNenetToKurai.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNenetToKuraiTwo
Of course, my lady.
![[Nenet, the Scout - SelectionBanterNenetToKuraiTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNenetToIsla
I'm here. What is that ticking noise?
![[Nenet, the Scout - SelectionBanterNenetToIsla.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNenetToIslaTwo
The second one.
![[Nenet, the Scout - SelectionBanterNenetToIslaTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNenetToIslaThree
I have very good ears.
![[Nenet, the Scout - SelectionBanterNenetToIslaThree.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNenetToIslaFour
Are you... going to check on that ticking?
![[Nenet, the Scout - SelectionBanterNenetToIslaFour.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNenetToIslaFive
Your confidence is my confidence.
![[Nenet, the Scout - SelectionBanterNenetToIslaFive.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterIslaNenetReply
Why are you bringing that up here?!
![[Nenet, the Scout - SelectionBanterIslaNenetReply.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterIslaNenetReplyTwo
Sands swallow me, so that I die right here...
![[Nenet, the Scout - SelectionBanterIslaNenetReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterNenetToIsla
EntryBanterNenetToIsla
![[Nenet, the Scout - EntryBanterNenetToIsla.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterNenetToIslaTwo
EntryBanterNenetToIslaTwo
![[Nenet, the Scout - EntryBanterNenetToIslaTwo.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterNenetIslaReplyThree
EntryBanterNenetIslaReplyThree
![[Nenet, the Scout - EntryBanterNenetIslaReplyThree.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterIslaNenetReply
Bleak.
![[Nenet, the Scout - EntryBanterIslaNenetReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterNenetToIsla
We made it.
![[Nenet, the Scout - ExitBanterNenetToIsla.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterNenetToIslaTwo
Thank you.
![[Nenet, the Scout - ExitBanterNenetToIslaTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterIslaNenetReply
It is remarkable how we beat the odds when we are together.
![[Nenet, the Scout - ExitBanterIslaNenetReply.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterGiannaNenetReply
And no one gets a happy ending. Yes?
![[Nenet, the Scout - EntryBanterGiannaNenetReply.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterNenetToGianna
All mortal endeavour is sand cast to the winds.
![[Nenet, the Scout - EntryBanterNenetToGianna.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterNenetToGiannaTwo
...Of course. That is the exception.
![[Nenet, the Scout - EntryBanterNenetToGiannaTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterGiannaNenetReply
No. All the battles are very real.
![[Nenet, the Scout - ExitBanterGiannaNenetReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterGiannaNenetReplyTwo
By surviving. The dead feel great boredom.
![[Nenet, the Scout - ExitBanterGiannaNenetReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterNenetToGianna
That was a... five thumb performance, yes?
![[Nenet, the Scout - ExitBanterNenetToGianna.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterGiannaNenetReply
Yes.
![[Nenet, the Scout - SelectionBanterGiannaNenetReply.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterGiannaNenetReplyTwo
I can. We have a job. You have a role to play.
![[Nenet, the Scout - SelectionBanterGiannaNenetReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNenetToGianna
I believe I was requested.
![[Nenet, the Scout - SelectionBanterNenetToGianna.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNenetToGiannaTwo
I suppose not.
![[Nenet, the Scout - SelectionBanterNenetToGiannaTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNenetToGiannaThree
Actually, I think I do mind.
![[Nenet, the Scout - SelectionBanterNenetToGiannaThree.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNenetToGiannaFour
Please stop.
![[Nenet, the Scout - SelectionBanterNenetToGiannaFour.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNenetToGiannaFive
Now.
![[Nenet, the Scout - SelectionBanterNenetToGiannaFive.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterVinderiNenetReply
No.
![[Nenet, the Scout - EntryBanterVinderiNenetReply.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterVinderiNenetReplyFive
...Fine.
![[Nenet, the Scout - EntryBanterVinderiNenetReplyFive.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterNenetToVinderi
The air is sour. Something is ami--
![[Nenet, the Scout - EntryBanterNenetToVinderi.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterNenetToVinderiTwo
EntryBanterNenetToVinderiTwo
![[Nenet, the Scout - EntryBanterNenetToVinderiTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterVinderiNenetReply
I saw everything back there.
![[Nenet, the Scout - ExitBanterVinderiNenetReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterVinderiNenetReplyTwo
Even that vile act, yes.
![[Nenet, the Scout - ExitBanterVinderiNenetReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterNenetToVinderi
Victory, and yet the buzzards circle.
![[Nenet, the Scout - ExitBanterNenetToVinderi.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterVinderiNenetReply
Yes. You are required.
![[Nenet, the Scout - SelectionBanterVinderiNenetReply.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterVinderiNenetReplyTwo
It's a building, not a bomb.
![[Nenet, the Scout - SelectionBanterVinderiNenetReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNenetToVinderi
Hello. Nenet is here.
![[Nenet, the Scout - SelectionBanterNenetToVinderi.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNenetToVinderiTwo
Nenet.
![[Nenet, the Scout - SelectionBanterNenetToVinderiTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNenetToVinderiThree
Oh look. You found me.
![[Nenet, the Scout - SelectionBanterNenetToVinderiThree.ogg]]

#### Introduction
You are an exile? Then you, too, have had your rightful home stolen from you - unless you actually committed the crimes you were accused of. But of course you haven't. We are all innocent here, yes?
![[Nenet, the Scout - Introduction.ogg]]

#### The Boss
I have been looking for someone to follow my entire life. Someone to inspire me, to give meaning and community to my days. The Boss is... to put it bluntly, not that man. However, he is better than nothing. Because of what he has built here, we unwanted scum have what some could call a society. Here, everyone is welcome regardless of station or ability, provided they are willing to work. The Boss has made it so.
![[Nenet, the Scout - The Boss.ogg]]

#### The Book of Jamanra
I am honoured, Exile, that one of your strength would even speak to me, let alone help me. I am an outcast, and it is that very status which drives me for this mission. I have traveled far, and for many years, to find the resources and allies to do what I intend. Here I am in this place, before you now, ready. Where I am from, the Plains of Vastiri, the Maraketh hold no pity for the weak or the supposedly useless. The other outcasts found me and raised me, and though our lives are harsh, we have a meager culture of our own. We call ourselves the Faridun. The Maraketh believe we are worthless and flawed, but I am convinced I can prove that is not true. There is a legend among my people of a bold warrior who tried to unite the scattered Faridun camps thousands of years ago. His name was Jamanra, and he wished only to unify us so that we might come into our own as a people. If I can prove that he existed by finding the Book of Jamanra, then I may be able to initiate a ritual challenge with the Maraketh to test Faridun warriors for worthiness. If we pass, they will have to accept us back into the lives we should have had! Will you help me win back my home, Exile?
![[Nenet, the Scout - The Book of Jamanra.ogg]]

#### The Book of Jamanra_2
Jamanra did exist, Exile... and they killed him. The Sekhemas agreed to meet with him to discuss recognizing the Faridun nation, but it was a trick. They poisoned him. The supposedly honourable high-and-mighty Maraketh poisoned our greatest leader. I suppose I should have expected nothing less from this brutal world we live in, Exile. You and I know best that hope is an illusion, and that raw force is the only way to take anything for oneself. In any case, I thank you for aiding me.
![[Nenet, the Scout - The Book of Jamanra_2.ogg]]

#### Jamanra's Rest
I have come to a decision, Exile. I do not believe the Maraketh will ever willingly give us a home, or let us make our own. The Book you helped me retrieve tells Jamanra's tale, but it goes a bit further than that. It also tells of his final resting place. You can already guess what I intend, yes? In this land of madness where the dead rise and legendary figures return, I have a reasonable suspicion Jamanra can be found and released from his tomb. If the Maraketh will not listen to our peaceful pleas, then perhaps we Faridun will carve a home for ourselves on the Plains of Vastiri with the sharp edge of a sword. Jamanra can finish what he began thousands of years ago, and if he is empowered by Corruption this time around, then no cowardly poison will be able to stop him. Help me find Jamanra in his tomb and convince him to lead our cause, Exile!
![[Nenet, the Scout - Jamanra's Rest.ogg]]

#### Jamanra's Rest_2
Jamanra was a raving mad monster... there is no hope, Exile. I appreciate your aid, but I no longer see a way forward. Who was I to think that I could change thousands of years of brutal tradition? This life of thievery and villainy is all that there is for me. I think I'm going to take refuge in mead from now on.
![[Nenet, the Scout - Jamanra's Rest_2.ogg]]

#### Isla
Although Isla is often distracted, she is quite kind. She has a strength I have never seen before, one born of machines and intellect rather than fighting skill. I would never admit this to anyone, of course, but her steadfast support makes this place almost feel like a home. That is, when her mechanical spider isn't chewing my belongings.
![[Nenet, the Scout - Isla.ogg]]

#### The Plains of Vastiri
It is an elegant lie, that name: the 'Plains' of Vastiri. I know it only as a harsh desert, a blasted wasteland of broken rock, crimson sands, and salted earth. Those who call it the 'Plains' see it as it was thousands of years ago. They are deluded. But who am I to judge? I still believe I'll find a home someday, even with a face like mine. Perhaps we all need a few delusions to keep us sane. What's your flavour of madness, Exile?
![[Nenet, the Scout - The Plains of Vastiri.ogg]]

#### Strange Voice
Sometimes, when you are near, I hear whispers. Even though I have the best ears among all these thieves, I cannot make out the words... but they sound like my constant companions - my depression, paranoia, and hatred - when I am at my worst. Be careful, Exile.
![[Nenet, the Scout - Strange Voice.ogg]]

#### NenetContractSelectedOne
I will not fail you.
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetContractSelectedOne.ogg]]

#### NenetContractSelectedTwo
Lead, and I shall follow.
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetContractSelectedTwo.ogg]]

#### NenetContractSelectedThree
Your orders shall be my law.
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetContractSelectedThree.ogg]]

#### NenetBlueprintSelectedOne
I will not fail the group.
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetBlueprintSelectedOne.ogg]]

#### NenetBlueprintSelectedTwo
I will do my part.
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetBlueprintSelectedTwo.ogg]]

#### NenetBlueprintSelectedThree
You will not regret including me.
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetBlueprintSelectedThree.ogg]]

#### NenetPerceptionShortOne
I see.
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetPerceptionShortOne.ogg]]

#### NenetPerceptionShortTwo
It's quite clear to me.
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetPerceptionShortTwo.ogg]]

#### NenetPerceptionShortThree
Of course.
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetPerceptionShortThree.ogg]]

#### NenetPerceptionLongOne
Allow me a moment to focus...
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetPerceptionLongOne.ogg]]

#### NenetPerceptionLongTwo
Seeing sometimes relies on more than one's eyes.
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetPerceptionLongTwo.ogg]]

#### NenetPerceptionLongThree
Quiet, I'm listening...
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetPerceptionLongThree.ogg]]

#### NenetPerceptionShortAlarmOne
Indeed!
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetPerceptionShortAlarmOne.ogg]]

#### NenetPerceptionShortAlarmTwo
Quickly, yes!
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetPerceptionShortAlarmTwo.ogg]]

#### NenetPerceptionShortAlarmThree
Reporting!
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetPerceptionShortAlarmThree.ogg]]

#### NenetPerceptionLongAlarmOne
I'm trying to focus!
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetPerceptionLongAlarmOne.ogg]]

#### NenetPerceptionLongAlarmTwo
Let me listen!
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetPerceptionLongAlarmTwo.ogg]]

#### NenetPerceptionLongAlarmThree
Quickly!
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetPerceptionLongAlarmThree.ogg]]

#### NenetVaultShortOne
No lock can bar me.
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetVaultShortOne.ogg]]

#### NenetVaultShortTwo
What's theirs is ours.
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetVaultShortTwo.ogg]]

#### NenetVaultShortThree
Not a problem.
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetVaultShortThree.ogg]]

#### NenetVaultLongOne
They might as well have left this unlocked.
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetVaultLongOne.ogg]]

#### NenetVaultLongTwo
Did they even try to secure this?
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetVaultLongTwo.ogg]]

#### NenetVaultLongThree
I can break this vault. No problem.
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetVaultLongThree.ogg]]

#### NenetVaultShortAlarmOne
Working quickly!
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetVaultShortAlarmOne.ogg]]

#### NenetVaultShortAlarmTwo
Smash and grab!
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetVaultShortAlarmTwo.ogg]]

#### NenetVaultShortAlarmThree
On it!
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetVaultShortAlarmThree.ogg]]

#### NenetVaultLongAlarmOne
You can do this, Nenet...
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetVaultLongAlarmOne.ogg]]

#### NenetVaultLongAlarmTwo
I'll do my best!
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetVaultLongAlarmTwo.ogg]]

#### NenetVaultLongAlarmThree
I can do it!
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetVaultLongAlarmThree.ogg]]

#### NenetBusyOne
Sorry, I am busy.
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetBusyOne.ogg]]

#### NenetBusyTwo
I cannot just now.
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetBusyTwo.ogg]]

#### NenetBusyThree
I'll be with you in a moment.
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetBusyThree.ogg]]

#### NenetBusyFour
I hear you, but cannot yet.
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetBusyFour.ogg]]

#### NenetBusyFive
I am already tasked!
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetBusyFive.ogg]]

#### NenetBusyAlarmOne
Busy!
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetBusyAlarmOne.ogg]]

#### NenetBusyAlarmTwo
I can't!
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetBusyAlarmTwo.ogg]]

#### NenetBusyAlarmThree
I'm otherwise engaged!
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetBusyAlarmThree.ogg]]

#### NenetBusyAlarmFour
No time!
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetBusyAlarmFour.ogg]]

#### NenetBusyAlarmFive
I can't do that!
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetBusyAlarmFive.ogg]]

#### NenetInterruptedOne
I am under attack!
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetInterruptedOne.ogg]]

#### NenetInterruptedTwo
I require aid!
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetInterruptedTwo.ogg]]

#### NenetInterruptedThree
They've caught me!
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetInterruptedThree.ogg]]

#### NenetInterruptedFour
They have me!
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetInterruptedFour.ogg]]

#### NenetInterruptedAlarmOne
Help!
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetInterruptedAlarmOne.ogg]]

#### NenetInterruptedAlarmTwo
Ouch!
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetInterruptedAlarmTwo.ogg]]

#### NenetInterruptedAlarmThree
To me, quickly!
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetInterruptedAlarmThree.ogg]]

#### NenetInterruptedAlarmFour
Caught!
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetInterruptedAlarmFour.ogg]]

#### NenetCombatStartOne
I do not fear death.
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetCombatStartOne.ogg]]

#### NenetCombatStartTwo
So the clash comes.
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetCombatStartTwo.ogg]]

#### NenetCombatStartThree
So much for stealth.
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetCombatStartThree.ogg]]

#### NenetCombatStartFour
Death, one way or another!
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetCombatStartFour.ogg]]

#### NenetCombatStartFive
Fight together and we shall overcome!
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetCombatStartFive.ogg]]

#### NenetCombatStartAlarmOne
We shall stand.
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetCombatStartAlarmOne.ogg]]

#### NenetCombatStartAlarmTwo
A fight, then.
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetCombatStartAlarmTwo.ogg]]

#### NenetCombatStartAlarmThree
Unite!
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetCombatStartAlarmThree.ogg]]

#### NenetCombatStartAlarmFour
Here they come!
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetCombatStartAlarmFour.ogg]]

#### NenetCombatStartAlarmFive
Clash!
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetCombatStartAlarmFive.ogg]]

#### NenetCombatEndOne
Today is not the end, then.
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetCombatEndOne.ogg]]

#### NenetCombatEndTwo
I knew we could do it.
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetCombatEndTwo.ogg]]

#### NenetCombatEndThree
Back to stealth.
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetCombatEndThree.ogg]]

#### NenetCombatEndFour
Death... for them.
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetCombatEndFour.ogg]]

#### NenetCombatEndFive
Together. Success.
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetCombatEndFive.ogg]]

#### NenetCombatEndAlarmOne
Good. Move!
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetCombatEndAlarmOne.ogg]]

#### NenetCombatEndAlarmTwo
Go!
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetCombatEndAlarmTwo.ogg]]

#### NenetCombatEndAlarmFour
We must continue.
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetCombatEndAlarmFour.ogg]]

#### NenetCombatEndAlarmFive
Good riddance.
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetCombatEndAlarmFive.ogg]]

#### NenetLootOne
Take what you can. Live for now.
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetLootOne.ogg]]

#### NenetLootTwo
Treasure for the taking.
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetLootTwo.ogg]]

#### NenetLootThree
I hope you will share that.
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetLootThree.ogg]]

#### NenetLootFour
All that glitters.
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetLootFour.ogg]]

#### NenetLootFive
More is better than less.
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetLootFive.ogg]]

#### NenetLootAlarmOne
Is that wise?!
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetLootAlarmOne.ogg]]

#### NenetLootAlarmTwo
Should we really delay like this?
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetLootAlarmTwo.ogg]]

#### NenetLootAlarmThree
We must make haste!
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetLootAlarmThree.ogg]]

#### NenetLootAlarmFour
Treasure or life?
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetLootAlarmFour.ogg]]

#### NenetLootAlarmFive
We need to escape!
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetLootAlarmFive.ogg]]

#### NenetAlertOne
We may be spotted soon.
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetAlertOne.ogg]]

#### NenetAlertTwo
We are treading too heavily.
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetAlertTwo.ogg]]

#### NenetAlertThree
We can ill afford any more mistakes.
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetAlertThree.ogg]]

#### NenetAlertFour
They will catch on to our presence.
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetAlertFour.ogg]]

#### NenetAlarmTriggeredOne
Swiftly, now.
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetAlarmTriggeredOne.ogg]]

#### NenetAlarmTriggeredTwo
As expected.
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetAlarmTriggeredTwo.ogg]]

#### NenetAlarmTriggeredThree
We should escape now.
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetAlarmTriggeredThree.ogg]]

#### NenetAlarmTriggeredEarlyOne
We have been spotted!
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetAlarmTriggeredEarlyOne.ogg]]

#### NenetAlarmTriggeredEarlyTwo
Too clumsy!
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetAlarmTriggeredEarlyTwo.ogg]]

#### NenetAlarmTriggeredEarlyThree
They've seen us!
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetAlarmTriggeredEarlyThree.ogg]]

#### NenetFinalRoomOne
Here we are, then.
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetFinalRoomOne.ogg]]

#### NenetFinalRoomTwo
Do you remember what to do?
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetFinalRoomTwo.ogg]]

#### NenetFinalRoomThree
If you need help, I am here.
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetFinalRoomThree.ogg]]

#### NenetFinalRoomFour
Exile, make your move.
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetFinalRoomFour.ogg]]

#### NenetFinalRoomAlarmOne
Make your move quickly!
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetFinalRoomAlarmOne.ogg]]

#### NenetFinalRoomAlarmTwo
Clumsy but speedy, now!
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetFinalRoomAlarmTwo.ogg]]

#### NenetFinalRoomAlarmThree
Get it done!
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetFinalRoomAlarmThree.ogg]]

Ah, the Templar.

What's a god?
![[Nenet, the Scout - SelectionBanterNilesNenetReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNenetToNiles
Hello. What is the plan?
![[Nenet, the Scout - SelectionBanterNenetToNiles.ogg]]

Niles, I can feel you trying to read my thoughts.

#### SelectionBanterNenetToNilesThree
I do not mind.
![[Nenet, the Scout - SelectionBanterNenetToNilesThree.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterNilesNenetReply
Good thing for you that I am not a man.
![[Nenet, the Scout - EntryBanterNilesNenetReply.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterNenetToNiles
Perhaps this is the day that we shall die.
![[Nenet, the Scout - EntryBanterNenetToNiles.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterNenetToNilesTwo
I shall likely let you know soon.
![[Nenet, the Scout - EntryBanterNenetToNilesTwo.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterHuckNenetReply
Like the ribcage of a dunewalker as the buzzards pick out his organs.
![[Nenet, the Scout - EntryBanterHuckNenetReply.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterNenetToHuck
Where we go, death follows swiftly.
![[Nenet, the Scout - EntryBanterNenetToHuck.ogg]]

If you insist.

You never asked.

That's my favourite.
![[Nenet, the Scout - ExitBanterNilesNenetReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterNenetToNiles
This was a doomed run, yet we cheated fate.

#### ExitBanterNenetToNilesTwo
I certainly hope so.
![[Nenet, the Scout - ExitBanterNenetToNilesTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterHuckNenetReply
Be glad that you are not. Immortality dulls the senses. To be mortal is to feel all life has to offer.
![[Nenet, the Scout - ExitBanterHuckNenetReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterNenetToHuck
Death's pursuit is inescapable, but we have delayed it this day.

#### NenetThaumaturgyLongTwo
I can almost hear their thoughts...
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetThaumaturgyLongTwo.ogg]]

#### NenetThaumaturgyLongThree
Isla says the mind is just another system of gears...
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetThaumaturgyLongThree.ogg]]

#### NenetThaumaturgyShortLoudOne
Focusing!
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetThaumaturgyShortLoudOne.ogg]]

#### NenetThaumaturgyShortLoudTwo
I shall try.
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetThaumaturgyShortLoudTwo.ogg]]

That was harrowing.

Let's return to that rat-ridden place we call home.

I hope the Boss approves of my performance.
![[Nenet, the Scout - NenetExitBanterFour.ogg]]

#### NenetExitBanterFive
My prediction of our deaths appears to have been wrong.
