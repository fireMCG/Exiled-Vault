## Johan, the King's Hand Dialogue
#### Introduction
My name is Johan, and I am from the far east. My people, the Kalguurans, are attempting to build a settlement near here. We could use someone with your talents. You know the land, you know the dangers. Will you join us? I'll await your answer in Kingsmarch.
![[Johan, the King's Hand - Introduction.ogg]]

#### Introduction_2
I am glad you decided to join us. I hesitate to call you 'Exile,' for we are all exiles in this foreign land. As the King's Hand, I serve as Treasurer of Kingsmarch. Come to me for all financial and resource management matters.
![[Johan, the King's Hand - Introduction_2.ogg]]

#### Faustus
We have contracted Captain Faustus, of the {Fair Marylene}, for ties to the markets of Wraeclast. Speak to him next. I am certain we will all be working together very closely.
![[Johan, the King's Hand - Faustus.ogg]]

#### Raulf
Next, you should familiarise yourself with our recruitment processes. Introduce yourself to Raulf, hire a recruit, and then return to me to discuss placement.
![[Johan, the King's Hand - Raulf.ogg]]

#### Allocate a Worker
You've hired someone? Then let's place them in a role.
![[Johan, the King's Hand - Allocate a Worker.ogg]]

#### Fund the Treasury
We'll also need some initial funding for wages and administration. Deposit some gold in the Treasury, and we'll speak further.
![[Johan, the King's Hand - Fund the Treasury.ogg]]

#### Invest in Recruitment
The last thing we need to discuss is {investment.} Necessary infrastructure will require substantial resources. For now, make our first investment in our Recruitment capabilities, just to learn the process.
![[Johan, the King's Hand - Invest in Recruitment.ogg]]

#### Quest Complete
These beginnings may seem inauspicious, but I believe great things lie ahead. As long as we cooperate, both with each other and with the Charter's laws, everything will go according to plan.
![[Johan, the King's Hand - Quest Complete.ogg]]

#### Kingsmarch
Several of our people were already here in Wraeclast, undertaking expeditions of their own. When their outpost reached a certain size, the King, in his great wisdom, gifted them an official charter and a name. I was sent to aid in the execution and management of that charter. I serve as the King's Hand.
![[Johan, the King's Hand - Kingsmarch.ogg]]

#### Abilities
You don't appear to employ the power of runes, like we Kalguurans do. I am very curious how you accomplished what you did. I see that you have upon your person one of those so-called 'virtue gems,' but Nessa allowed me to borrow one, and it did nothing as far as I could determine.
![[Johan, the King's Hand - Abilities.ogg]]

#### JohanOnRunes
You'll have to ask our smith, Dannig, about runes. I am a man of figures and calculation, not metallurgy. You might actually know more than I do, if you're familiar with your 'Ezomytes.' They use a system of runes that is... oddly similar to our own.
![[Johan, the King's Hand - JohanOnRunes.ogg]]

#### Home
I am from Kalguur, on the continent of Middengard. We have reached Wraeclast by ship. The journey was quite long, and quite dangerous. Eventually, we may be able to open trade with Kalguur, but for now, we're on our own.
![[Johan, the King's Hand - Home.ogg]]

#### The King
A reckoning is coming, have no doubt about that. The King has his eye on Wraeclast, and he lays far-reaching plans. Only time will tell...
![[Johan, the King's Hand - The King.ogg]]

#### Loyalties
I make no secret that I am a man of two loyalties. I must serve the King's wishes, and I must also serve this Charter to the letter of the law. I am aware that Kingsmarch is a destination for many that would be considered... less than upstanding citizens. So long as I directly see no evidence of crime, sedition, or another rebellion, there is no conflict of interest. Kindly do not discuss your thoughts in my presence.
![[Johan, the King's Hand - Loyalties.ogg]]

#### The Tavern
I choose not to waste resources on a gilded office. It is here, in the Tavern, where drink and loose talk best meet. My presence may, hopefully, keep any {dangerous talk} to the shadows... where it belongs.
![[Johan, the King's Hand - The Tavern.ogg]]

#### JohanWildInfrastructureMapRunning
It is now possible for us to consider excursions into the Atlas.
![[Johan, the King's Hand - JohanWildInfrastructureMapRunning.ogg]]

#### JohanWildInfrastructureGuarding
We can now invest in naval protection.
![[Johan, the King's Hand - JohanWildInfrastructureGuarding.ogg]]

#### JohanWildUpgradeT1
Mining infrastructure will be crucial to our expansion
![[Johan, the King's Hand - JohanWildUpgradeT1.ogg]]

#### JohanWildUpgradeT2
If you can keep Tujen off the drink, he's a highly capable harbourmaster.
![[Johan, the King's Hand - JohanWildUpgradeT2.ogg]]

#### JohanWildUpgradeT3
Basic industry will certainly bolster our growth.
![[Johan, the King's Hand - JohanWildUpgradeT3.ogg]]

#### JohanWildUpgradeT4
The finer arts are an important step forward.
![[Johan, the King's Hand - JohanWildUpgradeT4.ogg]]

#### JohanWildUpgradeT5
I know Rog's been interested in running something for quite some time.
![[Johan, the King's Hand - JohanWildUpgradeT5.ogg]]

#### JohanWildUpgradeT6
I don't know how much I trust this 'Atlas', but the decision is yours.
![[Johan, the King's Hand - JohanWildUpgradeT6.ogg]]

There's been a development. Our scouts in the Atlas have been taken! We must do something immediately.

![[Johan, the King's Hand - JohanWildShipAttacked_6.ogg]]

![[Johan, the King's Hand - JohanWildKidnappedKilled_Random.ogg]]

#### JohanWildKidnappedKilled_4
Our captured scouts have been killed. A dark day.
![[Johan, the King's Hand - JohanWildKidnappedKilled_4.ogg]]

The sting of defeat wounds us all, sooner or later. Our men will be given posthumous honours.
![[Johan, the King's Hand - JohanWildKidnappedPlayerDied_Random.ogg]]

#### JohanWildRescueShipFailTime_Random
The pirates have executed our men. We just needed more {time...}
![[Johan, the King's Hand - JohanWildRescueShipFailTime_Random.ogg]]

Not all battles can be won. Many of the people here know that more than most.
![[Johan, the King's Hand - JohanWildRescueShipFailPlayerDied_Random.ogg]]

#### JohanWildRescueKidnappedSuccess_Random
Rescuing our kidnapped men has greatly improved morale. I'm beginning to believe Dannig's tales about you.
![[Johan, the King's Hand - JohanWildRescueKidnappedSuccess_Random.ogg]]

Your prowess is indeed great. Rescuing our ship from those pirates has earned you some loyalty around here.

Raulf may have worthy candidates. You should speak to him.

#### Legal Response
It seems the recent Royal Order of Criminal Hanging was damaged by seawater on its long journey over the ocean. Unfortunately, the pages listing the individuals to be tried were, in my opinion, unreadable. I would be remiss in my duties if I were to hang the wrong man based on my own interpretation of salt-bled letters. As it takes many months to make the voyage both there, for you to receive this reply, and back, for us to receive the proper text the punishment in question will exceed the Charter statute of limitations. With regret, I am unable to enforce the Order as the situation currently stands. My Deepest Apologies, Johan, your Hand on Wraeclast
