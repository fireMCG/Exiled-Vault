#### EntryBanterHuckToExile
Stay alert, stay safe.
![[Huck, the Soldier - EntryBanterHuckToExile.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterTullinaHuckReply
Seems irresponsible to tell your kids about your robberies.
![[Huck, the Soldier - ExitBanterTullinaHuckReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterHuckToTullina
I love it when a plan comes together.
![[Huck, the Soldier - ExitBanterHuckToTullina.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTullinaHuckReply
Mostly. Just some finishing touches.
![[Huck, the Soldier - SelectionBanterTullinaHuckReply.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTullinaHuckReplyTwo
Don't I know it. The number of times I've seen an operation turn to chaos because we didn't know about a door--
![[Huck, the Soldier - SelectionBanterTullinaHuckReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTullinaHuckReplyThree
--or even a door that is open when we expected it to be closed.
![[Huck, the Soldier - SelectionBanterTullinaHuckReplyThree.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterHuckToExile
Team.
![[Huck, the Soldier - SelectionBanterHuckToExile.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterHuckToTullina
Tullina.

#### SelectionBanterHuckInteruptOneA
So how's--
![[Huck, the Soldier - SelectionBanterHuckInteruptOneA.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterHuckInteruptTwoB
Sorry, you were--
![[Huck, the Soldier - SelectionBanterHuckInteruptTwoB.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterHuckInteruptThreeB
What I was trying to--
![[Huck, the Soldier - SelectionBanterHuckInteruptThreeB.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterHuckInteruptFourB
You--
![[Huck, the Soldier - SelectionBanterHuckInteruptFourB.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterHuckToKuraA
Thanks Kurai.
![[Huck, the Soldier - SelectionBanterHuckToKuraA.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterHuckToAdiyah
That was quite an adventure.
![[Huck, the Soldier - ExitBanterHuckToAdiyah.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterAdiyahHuckReply
Always happy to see your portals, Adiyah. And... Call me Huck.
![[Huck, the Soldier - ExitBanterAdiyahHuckReply.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterTibbsHuckReply
Sound advice for life in general, really.
![[Huck, the Soldier - EntryBanterTibbsHuckReply.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterHuckToTibbs
What's the rule, everyone? Be efficient, and...?
![[Huck, the Soldier - EntryBanterHuckToTibbs.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterHuckToTibbsTwo
--Silent. Efficient and Silent.
![[Huck, the Soldier - EntryBanterHuckToTibbsTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterTibbsHuckReply
Definitely more than I could!
![[Huck, the Soldier - ExitBanterTibbsHuckReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterTibbsHuckReplyTwo
You're strong!
![[Huck, the Soldier - ExitBanterTibbsHuckReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterHuckToTibbs
Gravicius himself couldn't have planned a better operation.
![[Huck, the Soldier - ExitBanterHuckToTibbs.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTibbsHuckReply
Joining us on this job, Tibbs?
![[Huck, the Soldier - SelectionBanterTibbsHuckReply.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTibbsHuckReplyTwo
That's a relief, honestly. Normally I'm the largest target.
![[Huck, the Soldier - SelectionBanterTibbsHuckReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTibbsHuckReplyThree
I look like Kurai next to you!
![[Huck, the Soldier - SelectionBanterTibbsHuckReplyThree.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTibbsHuckReplyFour
Nothing, ma'am. Sorry.
![[Huck, the Soldier - SelectionBanterTibbsHuckReplyFour.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTibbsHuckToKurai
Sorry.
![[Huck, the Soldier - SelectionBanterTibbsHuckToKurai.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterHuckToTibbs
'Ello everyone.
![[Huck, the Soldier - SelectionBanterHuckToTibbs.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterHuckToTibbsTwo
Ah, blackguard training. Never leave yourself undefended. I used to sleep with my blackguard kit on. Got to the point where I couldn't sleep without it.
![[Huck, the Soldier - SelectionBanterHuckToTibbsTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterHuckToTibbsThree
Hah, no, no... I've a lighter chainmail for bedtime.
![[Huck, the Soldier - SelectionBanterHuckToTibbsThree.ogg]]

#### IntroductionKarstHuckReply
I'm Huck.
![[Huck, the Soldier - IntroductionKarstHuckReply.ogg]]

#### IntroductionKarstHuckReplyTwo
Not really? I suppose the Blackguard training did leave me a bit... rough.
![[Huck, the Soldier - IntroductionKarstHuckReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterKarstHuckReply
How brave, Karst.
![[Huck, the Soldier - EntryBanterKarstHuckReply.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterHuckToKarst
Focus up everyone. Job comes first.
![[Huck, the Soldier - EntryBanterHuckToKarst.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterKarstHuckReply
Honestly kind of wish you didn't. Sorry. Too mean. Sorry.
![[Huck, the Soldier - ExitBanterKarstHuckReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterHuckToKarst
Messy in parts, Karst, but we got there.
![[Huck, the Soldier - ExitBanterHuckToKarst.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterKarstHuckReply
As am I.
![[Huck, the Soldier - SelectionBanterKarstHuckReply.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterKarstHuckReplyToKurai
He hasn't, lady Kurai.
![[Huck, the Soldier - SelectionBanterKarstHuckReplyToKurai.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterKarstHuckReplyTwo
Appreciate it, Karst.
![[Huck, the Soldier - SelectionBanterKarstHuckReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterHuckToKarstTwo
Bandit.
![[Huck, the Soldier - SelectionBanterHuckToKarstTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterHuckToKarstThree
That's because it is a bad thing.
![[Huck, the Soldier - SelectionBanterHuckToKarstThree.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterHuckToIsla
Good, Isla's here! A unit's only as good as its engineer, I always say.
![[Huck, the Soldier - SelectionBanterHuckToIsla.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterHuckToIslaTwo
Not that I... meant anything by that...
![[Huck, the Soldier - SelectionBanterHuckToIslaTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterIslaHuckReply
Who, me?
![[Huck, the Soldier - SelectionBanterIslaHuckReply.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterHuckToIsla
I'll watch your back, keep you safe.
![[Huck, the Soldier - EntryBanterHuckToIsla.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterHuckToIslaTwo
It was a figure of speech.
![[Huck, the Soldier - EntryBanterHuckToIslaTwo.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterIslaHuckReply
Fear keeps a disciplined man alive.
![[Huck, the Soldier - EntryBanterIslaHuckReply.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterIslaHuckReplyTwo
I'm never going to wear that infernal thing, Isla. Stop asking, I beg of you.
![[Huck, the Soldier - EntryBanterIslaHuckReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterHuckToIsla
At some point, after so many close calls, a man's gotta admit he's just tired.
![[Huck, the Soldier - ExitBanterHuckToIsla.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterHuckToIslaTwo
How about that? A second wind! I'm fine now, plenty fine.
![[Huck, the Soldier - ExitBanterHuckToIslaTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterIslaHuckReply
That thing ripped a mannequin in half!
![[Huck, the Soldier - ExitBanterIslaHuckReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterIslaHuckReplyTwo
Oh, I am! I-, I am!
![[Huck, the Soldier - ExitBanterIslaHuckReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterGiannaHuckReply
What an horrible, horrible thing to say.
![[Huck, the Soldier - EntryBanterGiannaHuckReply.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterHuckToGianna
Don't want to hear no complaints. We all signed up for this.
![[Huck, the Soldier - EntryBanterHuckToGianna.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterGiannaHuckReply
Yes, I did see you, which is very much the opposite of what we wanted. You got lucky.
![[Huck, the Soldier - ExitBanterGiannaHuckReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterHuckToGiana
Gianna, you nearly bloody blew it for us.
![[Huck, the Soldier - ExitBanterHuckToGiana.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterHuckToGianaTwo
You need to keep a lower bloody profile.
![[Huck, the Soldier - ExitBanterHuckToGianaTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterGiannaHuckReply
Welcome, Gianna.
![[Huck, the Soldier - SelectionBanterGiannaHuckReply.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterGiannaHuckReplyTwo
Thanks, polished it m'self.
![[Huck, the Soldier - SelectionBanterGiannaHuckReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterHuckToGianna
What are my orders?
![[Huck, the Soldier - SelectionBanterHuckToGianna.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterHuckToGiannaTwo
Ha. Really, what are my orders.
![[Huck, the Soldier - SelectionBanterHuckToGiannaTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterHuckToGiannaThree
Gi, I think we need to focus.
![[Huck, the Soldier - SelectionBanterHuckToGiannaThree.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterVinderiHuckReply
Will do.
![[Huck, the Soldier - EntryBanterVinderiHuckReply.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterVinderiHuckReplyTwo
Wh-No! Nonono--
![[Huck, the Soldier - EntryBanterVinderiHuckReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterHuckToVinderi
Pace yourselves. Exhaustion down there means death.
![[Huck, the Soldier - EntryBanterHuckToVinderi.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterVinderiHuckReply
E-Excuse me!?
![[Huck, the Soldier - ExitBanterVinderiHuckReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterHuckToVinderi
Better than I hoped. Much better than I feared.
![[Huck, the Soldier - ExitBanterHuckToVinderi.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterHuckToVinderiTwo
Honestly, thought you'd blow us up.
![[Huck, the Soldier - ExitBanterHuckToVinderiTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterVinderiHuckReply
Vinderi, been meaning to ask you. Where'd you come up with the powder mixes?
![[Huck, the Soldier - SelectionBanterVinderiHuckReply.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterVinderiHuckReplyTwo
Not at all!
![[Huck, the Soldier - SelectionBanterVinderiHuckReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterVinderiHuckReplyThree
Forget it, Vin. Just making small-talk.
![[Huck, the Soldier - SelectionBanterVinderiHuckReplyThree.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterVinderiHuckReplyFour
Thanks, Vin.
![[Huck, the Soldier - SelectionBanterVinderiHuckReplyFour.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterHuckToKurai
Right, what've we got?
![[Huck, the Soldier - SelectionBanterHuckToKurai.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterHuckToVinderi
S'fine. Just focus on the job, yeah?
![[Huck, the Soldier - SelectionBanterHuckToVinderi.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterHuckToNenet
Alert and ready, scout?
![[Huck, the Soldier - SelectionBanterHuckToNenet.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterHuckToNenetTwo
Hah, I'm no Captain, but I appreciate it.
![[Huck, the Soldier - SelectionBanterHuckToNenetTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNenetHuckReply
You better be. This is going to be a tough one.
![[Huck, the Soldier - SelectionBanterNenetHuckReply.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterHuckToNenet
Remember, stay alert, eyes peeled.
![[Huck, the Soldier - EntryBanterHuckToNenet.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterNenetHuckReply
...You mean for our enemies, right?
![[Huck, the Soldier - EntryBanterNenetHuckReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterHuckToNenet
Gods, I feel immortal! What a rush.
![[Huck, the Soldier - ExitBanterHuckToNenet.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterNenetHuckReply
Reckon that calls for a celebration!
![[Huck, the Soldier - ExitBanterNenetHuckReply.ogg]]

#### Introduction
Sir! Sorry, old habit. You'll get used to it. Blackguard training did a number on me. I'm Huck. Served in the Oriath 3rd for five years. Dishonourably discharged, though I consider that an honour. My time with the Blackguards put a lot of things in perspective, least once I had some distance from them. What we do here might be illegal, but that don't make it wrong. You need something -- anything -- you come to me, yeah? We're family now. Family look out for each other.
![[Huck, the Soldier - Introduction.ogg]]

#### The Boss
Haven't actually met him myself. Been dealing mostly with lady Kurai. Bit like the old days, really. Orders come down the chain and stop when they hit the right pair of ears. I'm eager to meet him though. Owe him my life. Had some very dark days after I got discharged. Not a lot of people want to hire veterans, especially when they leave the service under less-than-ideal circumstances. But the Boss secured me a place to live, and gave me a steady income and work to keep me busy.
![[Huck, the Soldier - The Boss.ogg]]

#### Enoch's Whereabouts
Ah, my contract. Took it out not long after joining the Ring to track down a mate of mine. Man named Enoch. Not easy making friends at my age, but active duty has a way of forging near-unbreakable bonds. Enoch and I got real close. Might as well've been brothers. Right before I got discharged, Enoch was called up to a special unit we'd heard rumours about. A group under the direction of Piety, of all people. Supposedly some elite strike force, but no one personally knew anyone who was a part of it. 'Til Enoch, that is. After I started working for the Boss, I asked Whakano to find Enoch. Thought he might be a good fit. But Whakano found no traces. I want to break into the Blackguard Records and find out where he's deployed.
![[Huck, the Soldier - Enoch's Whereabouts.ogg]]

#### HuckContractOneDuring
Let's see... Good. Enoch's file is in here. Let's go.
![[Huck, the Soldier - HuckContractOneDuring.ogg]]

#### Enoch's Whereabouts_2
Gods damn them. Piety, Dominus, Gravicius, the whole lot of 'em. They moved Enoch into an 'Unspecified Research' unit. Dead a month later, the cause listed as 'Severe reaction to subdermal augmentations'. They tried to turn him into a gods-damned gemling, and killed him in the process. Oh, Enoch. I'm so sorry, mate. I appreciate the backup, Exile. I need a bit of time to sort my emotions out, but I reckon I'll have more work for you soon enough.
![[Huck, the Soldier - Enoch's Whereabouts_2.ogg]]

#### Enoch's Remains
Not long after we found Enoch's file, Whakano informed me that he'd found Enoch's family, and that even they had no idea where he was. They assumed he was still on duty. Can you believe that? The bloody Templars had the gall to massacre Enoch and not even tell his family. That just don't sit right with me. His records don't list a final resting place, but I know that most blackguards who died on duty were cremated and put to rest in the tunnels beneath the city. It's a long-shot, but maybe we can find some trace of Enoch, to give his parents peace.
![[Huck, the Soldier - Enoch's Remains.ogg]]

#### Enoch's Remains_2
Enoch was the sort of man who'd starve to make sure you had something to eat. The sort of man whose oath to protect and preserve informed everything he did. He deserved far better than he got, and we can do nothing for him now. But with his service records and his tags, we can at least let his mum and dad know what happened. Don't worry, Exile. I'll handle this messy part. You've done more than enough. Thank you.
![[Huck, the Soldier - Enoch's Remains_2.ogg]]

#### IntroductionHuckAboutNiles
Thought we might be able to use another hand on this one. Meet Niles.
![[Huck, the Soldier - IntroductionHuckAboutNiles.ogg]]

#### IntroductionHuckAboutNilesTwo
He used to be an interrogator for the Templar. Can read minds a little bit.
![[Huck, the Soldier - IntroductionHuckAboutNilesTwo.ogg]]

#### IntroductionHuckAboutNilesThree
Just remember that he's very useful. I find that helps.
