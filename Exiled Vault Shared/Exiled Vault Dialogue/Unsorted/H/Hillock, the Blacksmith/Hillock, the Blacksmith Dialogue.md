![[Hillock, the Blacksmith - HillockDefeatedTen.ogg]]

#### HillockOfferBargainZero
You kill so good, Exile. Quick and splatty. You want to be friends just for today?
![[Hillock, the Blacksmith - HillockOfferBargainZero.ogg]]

#### HillockOfferBargainOne
Want a friend, I do. Sit in my room, bashing my hammer, talking to myself... gettin' ANGRY... with a friend maybe I wouldn't hurt people no more. Will you help me find a friend?
![[Hillock, the Blacksmith - HillockOfferBargainOne.ogg]]

#### HillockOfferBargainTwo
Making a new friend, I am. We was gonna eat dinner together. Bit of the drink. Talk about work. Told me a few things already you know. Let me go and I'll tell you what they told me.
![[Hillock, the Blacksmith - HillockOfferBargainTwo.ogg]]

#### HillockOfferBargainThree
I tried and tried to do this job but I don't get it. It doesn't make SENSE to me! Hurts my head! Makes me ANGRY. Makes me BREAK STUFF! Don't make me stay here.
![[Hillock, the Blacksmith - HillockOfferBargainThree.ogg]]

#### HillockOfferBargainFour
Miss the forge, I do. Can't make swords here the way I used to. Maybe you can tell the Lifegiver I burned to ashes and I can go back home. Back to the anvil, and the pub.
![[Hillock, the Blacksmith - HillockOfferBargainFour.ogg]]

#### HillockOfferBargainFive
I hate this job. Hate it! Makes no sense to me! My boss gave me some scribbled paper. Told me everything I need to know is on it, but I can't make out the pictures. If you let me go, you can take a look. Maybe you can work out what it means.
![[Hillock, the Blacksmith - HillockOfferBargainFive.ogg]]

#### HillockOfferBargainSix
Miss making my swords, I do. Sometimes, I get pictures in my head from a long time ago. Making beautiful swords. Better than I can make now. Feels like a different man in those pictures. A smarter man. Quicker. Been collecting a few pieces here and there. Not like the ones I make, but still strong. Makes me think of home, makes me feel connected to that smarter man. You can have them if you promise you won't hurt me anymore.
![[Hillock, the Blacksmith - HillockOfferBargainSix.ogg]]

#### HillockBargainAcceptedZero
Maybe this will make the bad thoughts go...
![[Hillock, the Blacksmith - HillockBargainAcceptedZero.ogg]]

#### HillockBargainAcceptedOne
Hard to make new friends, it is...
![[Hillock, the Blacksmith - HillockBargainAcceptedOne.ogg]]

#### HillockBargainAcceptedTwo
Oh no... this sounds hard, too!
![[Hillock, the Blacksmith - HillockBargainAcceptedTwo.ogg]]

#### HillockBargainAcceptedThree
I feel... happy...!
![[Hillock, the Blacksmith - HillockBargainAcceptedThree.ogg]]

#### HillockBargainAcceptedFour
This make any sense to you?
![[Hillock, the Blacksmith - HillockBargainAcceptedFour.ogg]]

#### HillockBargainAcceptedFive
Treat 'em good, okay?
![[Hillock, the Blacksmith - HillockBargainAcceptedFive.ogg]]

#### HillockOfferBetrayalZero
Boss talks down to me. Like I'm stupid. I'm not stupid. I'm NOT! Makes me SO ANGRY. Angry enough to bash them over and over again! I should be the boss, not them!
![[Hillock, the Blacksmith - HillockOfferBetrayalZero.ogg]]

#### HillockOfferBetrayalOne
The people in the Syndicate are afraid of me, they are. Know how good I can bash them. They'll give me whatever I want or else. Want to see?
![[Hillock, the Blacksmith - HillockOfferBetrayalOne.ogg]]

#### HillockOfferBetrayalTwo
I'm so angry right now Exile. Everything's RED. I need to hear bones SNAPPING. Need to feel it in my FISTS! I don't care who I break. Just tell me who. Tell me who!
![[Hillock, the Blacksmith - HillockOfferBetrayalTwo.ogg]]

#### HillockOfferBetrayalThree
I'll give the Syndicate here an option. I bash and bash and bash until I'm happy, or they tell you what you want to know. Then you let me go, okay?
![[Hillock, the Blacksmith - HillockOfferBetrayalThree.ogg]]

#### HillockOfferBetrayalFour
Vagan's too wriggly. Tried to catch him but he slipped away. Don't let him slip away again. Might not get another chance!
![[Hillock, the Blacksmith - HillockOfferBetrayalFour.ogg]]

#### HillockOfferBetrayalFive
I think I could smash Guff into the ground like a fence post. Bet he'd do anything to get out of that. What do you think, little Exile?
![[Hillock, the Blacksmith - HillockOfferBetrayalFive.ogg]]

#### HillockOfferBetrayalSix
Found Korell in my room praying to my forge. In MY room. I didn't say he could do that! Makes me so ANGRY! Learn respect, Redblade! Teach him respect, Exile!
![[Hillock, the Blacksmith - HillockOfferBetrayalSix.ogg]]

#### HillockOfferBetrayalSeven
I want to break the mask off Maloney's face, just to see how his skull cracks. Bet there's a lot of good knowledge inside that skull.
![[Hillock, the Blacksmith - HillockOfferBetrayalSeven.ogg]]

#### HillockOfferBetrayalEight
You bash well, Exile! Today we are friends. Let's bash another one shall we? Yeah?
![[Hillock, the Blacksmith - HillockOfferBetrayalEight.ogg]]

#### HillockOfferExecuteZero
Hate myself. Hate the Syndicate. Rather be dead.
![[Hillock, the Blacksmith - HillockOfferExecuteZero.ogg]]

#### HillockOfferExecuteOne
Kill me now, or the boss kills me later. Dead either way.
![[Hillock, the Blacksmith - HillockOfferExecuteOne.ogg]]

#### HillockOfferExecuteTwo
I will miss you, friend.
![[Hillock, the Blacksmith - HillockOfferExecuteTwo.ogg]]

#### HillockOfferExecuteThree
Rather be dead than go back to the dark.
![[Hillock, the Blacksmith - HillockOfferExecuteThree.ogg]]

#### HillockReplyToBetrayalAcceptedZero
You... rrggghh... rrrrRRAAAGGHHH!
![[Hillock, the Blacksmith - HillockReplyToBetrayalAcceptedZero.ogg]]

#### HillockReplyToBetrayalAcceptedOne
You're not my friend anymore, Leo Redmane.
![[Hillock, the Blacksmith - HillockReplyToBetrayalAcceptedOne.ogg]]

#### HillockReplyToBetrayalAcceptedTwo
Sleep with your eyes open, wild woman.
![[Hillock, the Blacksmith - HillockReplyToBetrayalAcceptedTwo.ogg]]

#### HillockReplyToBetrayalAcceptedThree
Oh, Mutewind. I will BURY you for this.
![[Hillock, the Blacksmith - HillockReplyToBetrayalAcceptedThree.ogg]]

#### HillockReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFour
You... are awful! Bash you so hard you need to be scraped up!
![[Hillock, the Blacksmith - HillockReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFour.ogg]]

#### HillockReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFive
You don't scare me, little mask boy. I'll break you and all your little machines.
![[Hillock, the Blacksmith - HillockReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFive.ogg]]

#### HillockReplyToBetrayalAcceptedSix
Bad! You're bad! Gonna bash you into RED MILK for this.
![[Hillock, the Blacksmith - HillockReplyToBetrayalAcceptedSix.ogg]]

#### HillockInterrogatedZero
Hate the dark!
![[Hillock, the Blacksmith - HillockInterrogatedZero.ogg]]

#### HillockInterrogatedOne
No, no, stop sending me to the dark!
![[Hillock, the Blacksmith - HillockInterrogatedOne.ogg]]

#### HillockInterrogatedTwo
So confusing, this Exile.
![[Hillock, the Blacksmith - HillockInterrogatedTwo.ogg]]

#### HillockReplyToExecutionZero
Bye bye!
![[Hillock, the Blacksmith - HillockReplyToExecutionZero.ogg]]

#### HillockReplyToExecutionOne
Friend, no! NO!
![[Hillock, the Blacksmith - HillockReplyToExecutionOne.ogg]]

#### HillockReplyToExecutionTwo
Bwahahaha. Very messy.
![[Hillock, the Blacksmith - HillockReplyToExecutionTwo.ogg]]

#### HillockSafehouseLeaderDefeatedZero
I don't... understand... I was the boss...
![[Hillock, the Blacksmith - HillockSafehouseLeaderDefeatedZero.ogg]]
