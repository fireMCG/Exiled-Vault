![[Ahuana - AhuanaCommentRecruitRecruit5.ogg]]

#### Utula's Defeat
I'm glad you defeated Utula. He is... well, he just doesn't fit in, you know? He needs to understand that this is a positive place, not meant for anger and savagery.
![[Ahuana - Utula's Defeat.ogg]]

#### Utula's Victory
Sorry about your loss, my friend. Utula takes everything a bit too seriously. Don't let him bully you.
![[Ahuana - Utula's Victory.ogg]]

Kaom of legend, defeated by the newcomer. Now that's a tale!
![[Ahuana - Kaom's Defeat.ogg]]

#### Kaom's Victory
Take heart, my friend. Kaom is a legendary warrior. You'll have another chance at him!
![[Ahuana - Kaom's Victory.ogg]]

#### Kiloava's Victory

![[Ahuana - Rakiata's Victory.ogg]]

#### Tawhanuku's Defeat
I'm surprised Toffee took that fight. She had to know she would lose. Maybe it's for a reason we have yet to understand!
![[Ahuana - Tawhanuku's Defeat.ogg]]

#### Tawhanuku's Victory
Losing to Toffee is nothing to feel bad about. When she takes fights, it's mostly because she's already foreseen that she's going to win! Takes quite the effort to subvert fate!
![[Ahuana - Tawhanuku's Victory.ogg]]

#### Ahuana's Defeat
I am impressed, my friend! You're becoming a fantastic fighter!

#### AhuanaCommentOnPurchaseEliteAkoya

![[Ahuana - AhuanaCommentOnPurchaseEliteAkoya.ogg]]

#### AhuanaRandomShout1
I hope you're having a good time, my friend!
![[Ahuana - AhuanaRandomShout1.ogg]]

#### Tavukai
The ancient {tavukai} against the use of projectile weapons is not a rule that applies to us. It was a matter of pride for those tribes that lauded brutish men with large axes. The Ramako Tribe prefers to fell warriors like that with well-placed arrows, long before their axes ever come close.
![[Ahuana - Tavukai.ogg]]

#### Hyrri
My mother was a great woman, and continues to be my role model, despite her inexplicable absence here. The other chieftains often talk about her wartime acts when she fought alongside Kaom, but by the time I was old enough to know her, she had long been Queen of the still-united tribes. I grew up in a time of turmoil and nightmare in the wake of the Cataclysm that destroyed the Eternals. Because she once helped put the men in power who likely caused it, my mother taught me that war is not the glorious endeavour our Way makes it out to be. All she wanted, by the end, was peace. She was begrudgingly taking an army raised from multiple tribes to deal with a strange threat on the edge of Ngamakanui... when she and her legion vanished without a trace. I did my best in the chaos that followed, but it wasn't enough...
![[Ahuana - Hyrri.ogg]]

#### Cataclysm
I was quite young when the world ruptured. The moon turned crimson, fire rained from the sky, warriors went mad with blood fever, and the seas boiled. None of us knew what caused it, but the destruction came from the direction of Sarn, and the mountains near it. The madmen must have gone too far... I had nightmares about that time for over a decade, until I finally traveled to the Isle of the Shrikes and passed my test of adulthood. After that, I felt like I could handle anything.
![[Ahuana - Cataclysm.ogg]]

#### Being Queen
After my mother's disappearance, the tribes began to fracture. I tried to take on the role of Queen, but inheriting such a title felt a bit too much like monarchy and empire, and the other tribes weren't receptive. Not after their experiences battling the Eternals. So, I used what meager power I had to suggest a new form of united government, a council of chieftains. From the trickle of news we get through living Karui that come to us for guidance, I hear that some form of that is still going on. I'm rather proud of that.
![[Ahuana - Being Queen.ogg]]

#### Victario
Oh, you've heard of my father? I've never met him. My mother only rolled her eyes whenever I asked about him. She told me of him once, the night before she left on her final campaign. She said he spoke with a poet's grace and made myriad boastful promises, but his heart truly belonged to a dead woman. He remained in Sarn when she took our people home, so he must have died in the Cataclysm. I would very much like to know more about him.
![[Ahuana - Victario.ogg]]

#### Hyrri's Soul
You found my mother's soul? I knew she was still out there somewhere! Though I do not believe she needs our aid. If you knew my mother like I did, you would know that nothing could keep her trapped against her will, especially not with an army at her back. If she is still fighting there, then she must believe that the battle is necessary. We have no idea what the stakes are, so we should leave her to it. If she required our aid, she would have requested it long ago.
![[Ahuana - Hyrri's Soul.ogg]]

#### Death
I died in childbirth, which is considered a warrior's death. I died knowing my daughter would live on. Then, because I was here, I was able to see her grow and thrive. She visited me for advice often, and I treasure those memories. Now, she fights as one of my own in these Halls. Among others, {her} daughter, and her daughter's daughter, also joined us. We now have dozens of descendants coming to us for wisdom. Life and death are strange partners. I have been here for far longer than I was alive, and my extended family only knows me as an ancestral spirit.
![[Ahuana - Death.ogg]]

#### The End of Time
The other tribes tell all sorts of stories about the end of time. Those are just fables. You see, the Sun sets somewhere inside the world each night, but it also changes course from season to season. Eventually, it will stray too near, and Wraeclast will be burned away by its heat. However, the Sun brings life as well, so once it returns to the sky, as it always does, there will be a burst of verdancy unlike we have never ever seen. If you think about it, it's the only end that makes sense.
![[Ahuana - The End of Time.ogg]]

#### Ramako
Ramako is both the Father of Light, and Father of the Sun. These are not the same duty. In the early days, he was just the Father of Light, and he brought beauty and warmth everywhere he went. The Mother of the Sun, Sione, lived alone in a jade palace in the sky. At that time, the Sun was no brighter than any other star, and it was verdant green. Sione, however, was the most ambitious of the gods. She traded away all of her tribe's possessions to foreign cultures in exchange for gold, and she plated her entire palace with that useless but shiny material. Her tribe was on the verge of starvation, but she asked them to trust her. They put on a festival with what little they had left, and to this, Ramako was invited. In awe of the supposed wealth of Sione, Ramako accepted her invitation to go through the traditions together. Once he entered her golden palace, his light reflected countless times, blazing warmth and life all over the world. Sione's palace cyclically rose above the world, then back into it, and while it was in the sky, that time became known as Day. To her credit, this shining beacon drew food, wealth, and respect to her tribe. Her gambit paid off. Ramako became the Father of the Sun ever after.
![[Ahuana - Ramako.ogg]]

#### Rongokurai
Ah, Ramako's brother! During the traditions, when Ramako first joined with Sione, Rongokurai came to the feasts at her palace. This confused the people and the animals, as the sky became dark at strange times when Rongokurai's darkness dimmed the reflecting light of her golden walls. This greatly irritated Sione, but there was nothing she could do. He was family! Her own sister often caused such disruptions already when that silver palace neared hers, and now Ramako's brother would interfere as well. She resolved to hold family gatherings as little as possible. That is why eclipses only happen every few years. The two sisters put aside their eternal war for a brief time to satisfy their traditional familial obligations. Even the gods must follow the Way.
![[Ahuana - Rongokurai.ogg]]

#### Lani Hua
Ah... yes... Ramako was impersonated by someone who visited Lani Hua, the Mother of the Moon, in his guise. My ancestors suspected the truth of this immediately. Arohongui had a very strange inheritance, with abilities prone to darkness and illusions, quite unlike Ramako's golden strength and honesty. There is a tale, very rarely told, of a deceiver being caught and locked away for this crime. Supposedly, it was the ancient elders of my tribe that enacted this justice. We consider the matter settled, but Sione and Lani Hua continue to battle for eternity in distant realms... they do not listen to us. They do not listen to anyone. All they care about is vengeance. It might be controversial in Western Ngamakanui, but I say that the gods who forget their people are not owed our loyalty.
![[Ahuana - Lani Hua.ogg]]

#### AhuanaConversationWithAkoyaOne
How are you doing today, Koko?
![[Ahuana - AhuanaConversationWithAkoyaOne.ogg]]

#### AhuanaConversationWithAkoyaTwo
So, good then?
![[Ahuana - AhuanaConversationWithAkoyaTwo.ogg]]

#### AhuanaConversationWithKiloavaOne
Perfection is a goal, not a destination!
![[Ahuana - AhuanaConversationWithKiloavaOne.ogg]]

#### AhuanaConversationWithKiloavaTwo
Of course you are, Keely!
![[Ahuana - AhuanaConversationWithKiloavaTwo.ogg]]
