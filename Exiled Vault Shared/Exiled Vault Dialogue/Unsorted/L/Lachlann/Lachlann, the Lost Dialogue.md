## Lachlann, the Lost Dialogue
#### LachlannWildShout_Random
Quickly! My family has been abducted!
![[Lachlann - LachlannWildShout_Random.ogg]]

#### Introduction
That bastard tyrant, Praetor Draven! He's taken my family hostage! They're being held somewhere beyond these gates. I never thought he would stoop {this} low! I sent for reinforcements... but... it's been so long... I must get through the gate... The keys... where are the blasted keys? I... I believe those cowards took them...

![[Lachlann - Introduction - 2.ogg]]

#### LachlannWildOpeningGate
At last! It's open! Praise the First Ones!
![[Lachlann - LachlannWildOpeningGate.ogg]]

#### Isabel
I can hear Isabel... Where is she? She calls to me... but we cannot go without Calum and Torcall!
![[Lachlann - Isabel.ogg]]

#### Calum and Torcall
My boys... I can hear them... They call to me! But we cannot go without Isabel...
![[Lachlann - Calum and Torcall.ogg]]

#### Family Reunion
My family... they are calling my name... but... but I can't follow... Why...? Why did the Eternals do this to us? They must pay for what they have done! I must make them {suffer!}
![[Lachlann - Family Reunion.ogg]]

#### LachlannWildWalkToGraves
What is this? {Graves?}
![[Lachlann - LachlannWildWalkToGraves.ogg]]

#### LachlannWildFindGraves
Isabel... Torcall... Calum... the family of Count Lachlann of Ogham... My family! This doesn't make any sense! They're {dead!} Those bastard Eternals... I must make them pay... I must make them {suffer!}
![[Lachlann - LachlannWildFindGraves.ogg]]

#### LachlannWildReturnToFight
I must make them {suffer!}
![[Lachlann - LachlannWildReturnToFight.ogg]]

#### Praetor Draven
The Praetor...? Oh, the Praetor! That monster! He is the worst man the Eternals could have chosen as the custodian for this territory. Had he come to us in peace, the clans might have been willing to talk, but that damn swine regards us as nothing but dogs. He invaded the village in the night, without warning, without honour! He seized my family, to try to force us to surrender. The Eternal Empire cares for nothing but power! But mark my words, we will not be ground under the heel of tyranny!
![[Lachlann - Praetor Draven - 1.ogg]]
![[Lachlann - Praetor Draven - 2.ogg]]
![[Lachlann - Praetor Draven - 3.ogg]]

#### Uprising
Uprising...? The uprising! Of course! The clans are uniting to fight for their freedom. We are making our stand in the Vale...
![[Lachlann - Uprising.ogg]]

#### LachlannOnHostages
Hostages...? Hostages! Praetor Draven is a coward, and without honour. He thinks he can keep us suppressed by holding my family hostage. He must pay for what he has done!
![[Lachlann - LachlannOnHostages.ogg]]

#### LachlannOnGraveyard
This graveyard is being built atop our clan graves by our oppressors, as an insult intended to crush our spirits. Misguided tyrants! We will never give up the fight. We're wearing them down, flesh and spirit. Conquerors they may be, but strong? Ha!
![[Lachlann - LachlannOnGraveyard - 1.ogg]]
![[Lachlann - LachlannOnGraveyard - 2.ogg]]

#### Ogham
Ogham? Oh yes, Ogham... this is the oldest home of the Ezomytes as we know ourselves. Past generations departed from here to settle Ezomyr and the Isles of Skothe. We did not always call this part of Phaaryl our homeland... and now the Eternals have come with their armies and laid claim to this place. It'll be a cold day in the Vastiri Desert before we submit!
![[Lachlann - Ogham - 1.ogg]]
![[Lachlann - Ogham - 2.ogg]]

#### Before Phaaryl
Before... Phaaryl...? Ah... the songs are unclear after so much time. A great many generations ago, we were driven here from elsewhere. There was simply too much Corruption, too much darkness... It was a time of chaos and terror, and much was lost. Our clans swore that this was the last time we would ever be cast out of our homes. Rise up, Ezomytes! We shall drive off these Eternal bastards!
![[Lachlann - Before Phaaryl - 1.ogg]]
![[Lachlann - Before Phaaryl - 2.ogg]]

#### LachlannFamily
All I can think about is seeing my beloved Isabel again, and holding my two boys in my arms... Torcall... Calum... it feels like it's been so long...
![[Lachlann - LachlannFamily.ogg]]

#### Asinia, The Consort
The Consort? Oh, Asinia! Curse the foul witch. She mired our lands with hexes upon our graves, so the dead may not die. She was but a servant girl to the Praetor's family... it was said she poisoned his first wife... aspired to replace her... She succeeded... and Draven... he was not dismayed by the darkness in her. He embraced it... and together, they conspired in their vile ambitions...
![[Lachlann - Asinia, The Consort - 1.ogg]]
![[Lachlann - Asinia, The Consort - 2.ogg]]

#### Draven Defeated
You {felled} the Praetor? By the First Ones! I... I can't quite believe it. But... there's no time to waste. We must get through the gate. Find the Praetor's Witch... Find the other key...
![[Lachlann - Draven Defeated - 1.ogg]]
![[Lachlann - Draven Defeated - 2.ogg]]

#### Asinia Defeated
You defeated Asinia? The Praetor will be devastated! He gets what he deserves. But... there's no time to waste. We must get through the gate. Find Draven... Find the other key...
![[Lachlann - Asinia Defeated - 1.ogg]]
![[Lachlann - Asinia Defeated - 2.ogg]]

#### The Gate
Do my eyes again deceive me? You have the keys! You showed those Eternal bastards! Use the keys to open the gate. Let's go and free my family!
![[Lachlann - The Gate.ogg]]

#### The Gate_2
What? Enough talk! Open the gate!
![[Lachlann - The Gate_2.ogg]]

#### LachlannWildGetOnWithIt_Random
Well, Don't just stand there. Get on with it!
![[Lachlann - LachlannWildGetOnWithIt_Random.ogg]]

#### LachlannWildGetOnWithIt_5
Are you numb in the head? There's much to do!
![[Lachlann - LachlannWildGetOnWithIt_5.ogg]]

#### LachlannWildGetOnWithIt_9
What...? What's happening? Are you lost too?
![[Lachlann - LachlannWildGetOnWithIt_9.ogg]]

#### LachlannWildReturnWithKeys_Random
You... you did it?
![[Lachlann - LachlannWildReturnWithKeys_Random.ogg]]

#### LachlannWildReturnWithKeys_4
You have the keys?
![[Lachlann - LachlannWildReturnWithKeys_4.ogg]]

#### LachlannGraveyardGlyph
The family of Count Lachlann of Ogham, murdered by the savage Eternals, laid to rest here for all time, together. The Ezomytes will have their vengeance! 1215 I.C.
![[Lachlann - LachlannGraveyardGlyph.ogg]]

#### ~~LachlannGrimTangleGlyph~~
Finn: There have been rumours that the forest paths have been somehow changing their shape. I can only ask the First Ones to aid this courier in finding his way to you. I will not be able to bring potion supplies to the outcasts this High Moon. I've seen signs that the behavioural changes of the forest beasts may be afflicting men as well. There is something deeply wrong in the Manor; a leering energy that vitalises sickly men and slows the healthy. The shadows are starker, a glaring absence, as though darkness yearns to snuff out the light. These fears must sound absurd, but I urge you to keep yourself and your fellow clanless safe. Pull up your ladders and do not eat the meat of the disturbed animals until we understand more. Lachlann, Head Servant of Ogham Manor
