It takes the toys. It doesn't get any.

#### ItThatFledSecondaryDefenderArrivalFourteen
It undoes its hard work! It is an enemy of It!
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledSecondaryDefenderArrivalFourteen.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledSecondaryDefenderArrivalFifteen
It hears the Lords telling It to kill!
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledSecondaryDefenderArrivalFifteen.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledSecondaryDefenderArrivalSixteen
It That Protects will soon meet its ancestors...
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledSecondaryDefenderArrivalSixteen.ogg]]

It is confused. It That Arrived is not meant to kill It That Fled.

Lies! Nature yearns for It That Fled with grasping fingers!
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven
It That Dismembers is not going to like what It reveals...
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight
It still has emotions... hurting, writhing, hungry emotions...

#### ItThatFledSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFour
Quicker, quicker! Many pieces! Many splinters!
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFour.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFive
Many organs for It to hold and whisper to...
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFive.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySix
It is the Lord of the Many with such joy and violence!
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySix.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySeven
It That Glows must do what It commands!
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySeven.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyEight
It That Laughs will be absorbed in the new order!
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyEight.ogg]]

Just like home. One It dies, one It rises.

#### ItThatFledEscapeOne
It can't have it. So says the Eternal It!
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledEscapeOne.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledEscapeTwo
It won't be caught!
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledEscapeTwo.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledDefeatedZero
Its domain! Noooo!
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledDefeatedZero.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledDefeatedOne
It doesn't understand...
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledDefeatedOne.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledDefeatedTwo
Why... why does It want its friends!?
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledDefeatedTwo.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledDefeatedThree
It... was only playing...
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledDefeatedThree.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledDefeatedFour
No no no no, not the Lonely Place again!
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledDefeatedFour.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledDefeatedFive
Bargain... bargain... bargain-bargain...
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledDefeatedFive.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledDefeatedSix
Such agony! It can share with It if It wants...
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledDefeatedSix.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledDefeatedSeven
Does It get to go through the Dark Place again?
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledDefeatedSeven.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledDefeatedEight
Now It is It That Lost, too. Its are even... Its are fair...
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledDefeatedEight.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledDefeatedNine
It has failed the Lords. It seeks mercy! Give It mercy!
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledDefeatedNine.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledDefeatedTen
It... lost...? It hurts within It. Dull and sharp... still and moving...
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledDefeatedTen.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledOfferBargainZero
It does not want to go to the Dark Place... the Lords whisper to It there. It needs to stay! It will do anything!
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledOfferBargainZero.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledOfferBargainOne
The hive buzzes with voices but It is all alone! Let It go. It wants to bring a friend from the Many.
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledOfferBargainOne.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledOfferBargainTwo
A gift! Leave It in the Bright Place. Give strength to the Many. Give It a friend. Yes. That is the way to find It That Never Dies.
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledOfferBargainTwo.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledOfferBargainThree
It is jealous. It does not like this place. It wants to be in another. Such pain and movement here. Does It allow It to go to another place? It will bring one of the Many back.
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledOfferBargainThree.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledOfferBargainFour
It wants to flee! Just let It flee!
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledOfferBargainFour.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledOfferBargainFive
It hears words It does not understand. The Lords nod and show their teeth when they hear the words. It can repeat them for It. Does it want to hear the words?
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledOfferBargainFive.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledOfferBargainSix
Such beautiful skins and claws It has collected. So sharp and shimmering. It will be sad to give such gifts to It, but It does not want to go to the Dark Place. Save It from the Dark Place and It can have its beauties.
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledOfferBargainSix.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledBargainAcceptedZero
The hive grows.
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledBargainAcceptedZero.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledBargainAcceptedOne
It moves to be close yet grows no closer.
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledBargainAcceptedOne.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledBargainAcceptedTwo
It will remember the pain of separation.
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledBargainAcceptedTwo.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledBargainAcceptedThree
Fleeeeeeeeeee!
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledBargainAcceptedThree.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledBargainAcceptedFour
Listen and do not blink.
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledBargainAcceptedFour.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledBargainAcceptedFive
Its gifts were chosen so carefully. It will miss them.
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledBargainAcceptedFive.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledOfferBetrayalZero
It has watched and listened to the Lords for an eternity. It can mimic them. It can sow many untruths about them. It will do this if It promises not to send It to the Dark Place.
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledOfferBetrayalZero.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledOfferBetrayalOne
Others think It cannot tell untruths, but It knows that many untruths are elsewhere truths. It can bring the truths to It That Never Dies, and the Lords would be punished. What does It think?
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledOfferBetrayalOne.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledOfferBetrayalTwo
When It tries to befriend one of the Many, they leak from their skin. Such moisture! It thinks it is liquid fear. It can make the others feel fear until they flee, wet and shimmering, just like It did! Then It will let It go free?
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledOfferBetrayalTwo.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledOfferBetrayalThree
It listens. It is always listening. Does it want to know what It has heard? It can repeat the words of the Many here.
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledOfferBetrayalThree.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledOfferBetrayalFour
It wants It to help It instead? It doesn't want to die. It was born flawed upon the Red Pyre, and did not rejoice like its siblings to be pulp and bone for the Lords. It would do anything not to go back to the blood and the dirt...
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledOfferBetrayalFour.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledOfferBetrayalFive
It hates its glow. Do you not see it? Blinding, burning, horrible! It must act against It!
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledOfferBetrayalFive.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledOfferBetrayalSix
It hates It That Is Hairy's brood. No thoughts, brood-mouths open, drooling power for the hated enemies from Before All. Animals, Its are. Diseased animals. It hates hates hates hates!
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledOfferBetrayalSix.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledOfferBetrayalSeven
Its Queen did not love the gifts It gave Its Queen. Not It of Many Legs. Not It of Sharp Claws. Always its Queen is angry. So It gives its Queen more anger.
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledOfferBetrayalSeven.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledOfferBetrayalEight
It That Dismembers breaks so many things! Turns bones to splinters and the splinters to dust! Leaves no splinters for It, even when It asks! It That Dismembers is so mean to It.
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledOfferBetrayalEight.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledOfferBetrayalNine
It That Disassembles tries to put the pieces back together. Always wrong. It can't make the pieces stay. Arms and faces and skin, a big pile. It wants to help, but It That Disassembles threatens It. So It gives up. Do whatever It wants with It That Disassembles.
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledOfferBetrayalNine.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledOfferExecuteZero
Yes, yes, send it to the Dark Place!
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledOfferExecuteZero.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledOfferExecuteOne
It will die for its Lord!
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledOfferExecuteOne.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledOfferExecuteTwo
It is just one of the Many. End It and another will come.
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledOfferExecuteTwo.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledOfferExecuteThree
No! It won't go back to the Lonely Place. It will have to kill It!
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledOfferExecuteThree.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledReplyToBetrayalAcceptedZero
Its suffering will be legendary!
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledReplyToBetrayalAcceptedZero.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledReplyToBetrayalAcceptedOne
Betray It. Do anything to It that It pleases. It grovels and begs and serves. All It asks is not to go back to the Dark Place, where the Lords whisper and laugh at It, mocking It, hurting It...
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledReplyToBetrayalAcceptedOne.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledReplyToBetrayalAcceptedTwo
It That Protects would not squawk so if It knew what the Red Pyre teaches Its at birth...
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledReplyToBetrayalAcceptedTwo.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledReplyToBetrayalAcceptedThree
It hates It That Prays! Such glowing! Hideous glowing...
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledReplyToBetrayalAcceptedThree.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFour
It That Boasts is stupid. It has a creator. It fled from It.
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFour.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFive
It looks and sees and listens and does not understand.
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFive.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledReplyToBetrayalAcceptedSix
It is so happy! It That Disassembles has made its heart awaken like warm muscle laid bare under the Broken Sun!
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledReplyToBetrayalAcceptedSix.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledInterrogatedZero
Why is It doing this to It?!
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledInterrogatedZero.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledInterrogatedOne
No! Not the Lonely Place!
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledInterrogatedOne.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledInterrogatedTwo
No bargain?
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledInterrogatedTwo.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledReplyToExecutionZero
It plays too rough!
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledReplyToExecutionZero.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledReplyToExecutionOne
The Many become The Few.
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledReplyToExecutionOne.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledReplyToExecutionTwo
It smiles.
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledReplyToExecutionTwo.ogg]]

#### ItThatFledSafehouseLeaderDefeatedZero
But... It was a Lord!
![[It that Fled - ItThatFledSafehouseLeaderDefeatedZero.ogg]]
