## Isla, the Engineer Dialogue
#### EntryBanterTullinaIslaReply
Pfft. It was hardly unexpected. Just early!
![[Isla, the Engineer - EntryBanterTullinaIslaReply.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterIslaToTullina
Tullina, how do you feel about having large, electrified metal rods jutting from your spine?
![[Isla, the Engineer - EntryBanterIslaToTullina.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterIslaToTullinaTwo
What about your skull?
![[Isla, the Engineer - EntryBanterIslaToTullinaTwo.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterIslaToTullinaThree
Got it. Legs it is.
![[Isla, the Engineer - EntryBanterIslaToTullinaThree.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterTullinaIslaReply
Smooth... Smooth... Hey, Tullina, what about a helmet that dissolves your hair while you wear it?
![[Isla, the Engineer - ExitBanterTullinaIslaReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterIslaToTullina
We probably shouldn't dilly-dally.
![[Isla, the Engineer - ExitBanterIslaToTullina.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterIslaToTullinaTwo
No reason. Totally unrelated, how upset would you be if everything you owned was shredded by a rogue mechanical spider?
![[Isla, the Engineer - ExitBanterIslaToTullinaTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTullinaIslaReply
Only if I can't get my wall-crawler up and running in time.
![[Isla, the Engineer - SelectionBanterTullinaIslaReply.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTullinaIslaReplyTwo
Couldn't be more wrong. It's a brilliant, beautiful mechanical spider.
![[Isla, the Engineer - SelectionBanterTullinaIslaReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTullinaIslaReplyThree
No, but that's what this is for, right lady Kurai?
![[Isla, the Engineer - SelectionBanterTullinaIslaReplyThree.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTullinaIslaReplyKurai
Oh... Fine.
![[Isla, the Engineer - SelectionBanterTullinaIslaReplyKurai.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterIslaToTullina
I've just had the best idea.
![[Isla, the Engineer - SelectionBanterIslaToTullina.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterIslaToTullinaTwo
Picture a wall, but completely transparent. You can stand on one side and see everything on the other side, but you can't touch it.
![[Isla, the Engineer - SelectionBanterIslaToTullinaTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterIslaToTullinaThree
That's--, no, that's different. Windows are different. This is larger and more transparent. You're just not getting it. Just forget about it. What's your thing?
![[Isla, the Engineer - SelectionBanterIslaToTullinaThree.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterIslaToTullinaFour
Yeah, let's do your thing.
![[Isla, the Engineer - SelectionBanterIslaToTullinaFour.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterIslaToAdiyah
My contraptions worked perfectly!
![[Isla, the Engineer - ExitBanterIslaToAdiyah.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterIslaToAdiyahTwo
Decently.
![[Isla, the Engineer - ExitBanterIslaToAdiyahTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterAdiyahIslaReply
Parameters fell within the plan.
![[Isla, the Engineer - ExitBanterAdiyahIslaReply.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterTibbsIslaReply
That's genius! If we make the plan sticky, we're less likely to drop it. I'll jot that down!
![[Isla, the Engineer - EntryBanterTibbsIslaReply.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterIslaToTibbs
Tibbs, can you see me?
![[Isla, the Engineer - EntryBanterIslaToTibbs.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterIslaToTibbsTwo
Fantastic. My visibility oil works!
![[Isla, the Engineer - EntryBanterIslaToTibbsTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterTibbsIslaReply
Tibbs, are you left or right handed?
![[Isla, the Engineer - ExitBanterTibbsIslaReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterTibbsIslaReplyTwo
So the evil reflection is still at large...
![[Isla, the Engineer - ExitBanterTibbsIslaReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterIslaToTibbs
Barely any malfunctions and plenty of data.
![[Isla, the Engineer - ExitBanterIslaToTibbs.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterIslaToTibbsTwo
That's a funny word! {Loot}.
![[Isla, the Engineer - ExitBanterIslaToTibbsTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTibbsIslaReply
The usual. Steal ALL of the THINGS!
![[Isla, the Engineer - SelectionBanterTibbsIslaReply.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTibbsReplyTwo
Afraid not. The bone decoupler decoupled itself. The test bone is fine, though there are now several thin metal strips deeply embedded in it.
![[Isla, the Engineer - SelectionBanterTibbsReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTibbsIslaReplyThree
Gave me an idea for intra-muscular springs. Tibbs, would you like to test something with me after this job?
![[Isla, the Engineer - SelectionBanterTibbsIslaReplyThree.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterIslaToTibbs
Made it! Had to put out a small fire, but I made it.
![[Isla, the Engineer - SelectionBanterIslaToTibbs.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterIslaToTibbsTwo
No, sadly someone beat me to that invention a long while ago. And this particular fire completely engulfed my heat-powered-exo-strider.
![[Isla, the Engineer - SelectionBanterIslaToTibbsTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterIslaToTibbsThree
Exo-strider. Yes. Put a few burning embers in the converter and off you stride! Just a prototype made of cheap materials, scrap metal, wood, oil-soaked rags--oh, dammit, Isla! You're better than this.
![[Isla, the Engineer - SelectionBanterIslaToTibbsThree.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterKarstIslaReply
Clandestine.
![[Isla, the Engineer - EntryBanterKarstIslaReply.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterKarstIslaReplyTwo
Even better!
![[Isla, the Engineer - EntryBanterKarstIslaReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterIslaToKarst
Got a new word for you, Karst. Taciturn. It means silent.
![[Isla, the Engineer - EntryBanterIslaToKarst.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterKarstIslaReply
New materials to experiment with! I'll turn gold into lead!
![[Isla, the Engineer - ExitBanterKarstIslaReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterIslaToKarst
Anyone got a quill? Had an idea on the run out of here.
![[Isla, the Engineer - ExitBanterIslaToKarst.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterKarstIslaReply
Karst! Did you finish it?
![[Isla, the Engineer - SelectionBanterKarstIslaReply.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterKarstIslaReplyTwo
The book! Did you get to the end?
![[Isla, the Engineer - SelectionBanterKarstIslaReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterKarstIslaReplyThree
Yeah, but it's a great start!
![[Isla, the Engineer - SelectionBanterKarstIslaReplyThree.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterIslaToKarst
Here I am!
![[Isla, the Engineer - SelectionBanterIslaToKarst.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterIslaToKarstTwo
No, the brain-bore still requires a few small optimisations.
![[Isla, the Engineer - SelectionBanterIslaToKarstTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterIslaToKarstThree
Oh! Sorry! You were making a joke! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
![[Isla, the Engineer - SelectionBanterIslaToKarstThree.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterIslaToKarstFour
What? No! It's already made. I'm just tweaking it a little.
![[Isla, the Engineer - SelectionBanterIslaToKarstFour.ogg]]

#### Introduction
Got somethin' needs made? Or unmade? I can take 'em apart as fast as I put them together, sometimes faster. Or is it the other way 'round? I've had an idea just now for a spinning device that - oh, yes, my name is Isla. I'm an engineer. Welcome.
![[Isla, the Engineer - Introduction.ogg]]

#### The Boss
The Boss? Oof, it's inefficient to ask about the Boss. Believe me. You'll go round and round, a spinning gear 'na machine made of secret parts. The one thing you should never rely on is a mechanism you don't understand. It's liable to implode, or {ex}plode. Neither is pretty when your arse is sittin' upon it hopin' to fly somewhere. The Boss put in an order for an air-sail once, for a job. Impossible, I told Kurai. Turned out it worked! It just didn't go with the poor sod we hired. It stayed with us in flames while he took to the skies. He achieved a perfect parabolic arc right onto the tower we were aiming for. Survived the trip, too, judgin' by the screaming. But getting back down? Oof, the Boss never ordered a falling machine. That's on him. Gotta think things through, mind you!
![[Isla, the Engineer - The Boss.ogg]]

#### Isla's Prototypes
{You} want to work with {me}? I didn't realize we were that close. This is fantastic! I'll need a partner to retrieve my early prototypes from the hands of the Templars. I made a series of precursor contraptions before I was exiled that would have led to some of my greatest achievements. If you can imagine it, my inventions could have done it... eventually. I didn't realise who I was working for until it was too late. They seized my prototypes and exiled me for the damage I caused in the process of building them. What's a few implosions in the pursuit of progress? Or maybe it was the sea tide of acid... or the glowing rock that made people sick... oh, yes. Care to help me steal those prototypes back?
![[Isla, the Engineer - Isla's Prototypes.ogg]]

#### Isla's Prototypes_2
My inventions! My babies! I missed them so much. I would never have found the proper materials to recreate them here on Wraeclast, not with all the horrific creatures roaming about. Thank you, Exile!
![[Isla, the Engineer - Isla's Prototypes_2.ogg]]

#### Isla's Designs
As I studied the prototypes you helped me retrieve, I realized that they'd already been examined... by someone else. The Templars must have lied about declaring my work heretical. They're trying to build them for their own gain! I cannot imagine what disaster they'll bring upon us if they manage to do so. We already have the prototypes, so now we must steal the designs they created based on them. We'll need to steal the blueprints for my Extreme Warmth Beam, my Storm Wooing Rod... hmm, the Mind Sublimator... and the Unbreakable, of course! I don't claim to be the most imaginative namer, but it is what it is. They're all related, eventually intended to be part of one single superweapon, so the designs should all be in one place. Let's go retrieve those blueprints!
![[Isla, the Engineer - Isla's Designs.ogg]]

#### Isla's Designs_2
We did it, Exile, at least in part. The designs for the Unbreakable were missing... I fear that they may have begun construction on it. If they complete the Unbreakable, we'll never be able to... break it. Science deserves better masters than the Templars!
![[Isla, the Engineer - Isla's Designs_2.ogg]]

#### Breaking the Unbreakable
My instruments have started going haywire. I believe the Templar have managed to build the Unbreakable, {my} greatest achievement. Normally, I would be thrilled at seeing my work given life, but I have a feeling the Unbreakable will be used against us, not for us. It's time to do some deconstruction. You're good at smashing things, yes? Then perhaps you can break the Unbreakable.
![[Isla, the Engineer - Breaking the Unbreakable.ogg]]

#### IslaContractThreeEncounterStart
Stop, in the name of science!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaContractThreeEncounterStart.ogg]]

#### IslaContractThreeEncounterEnd
My baby... my proudest work... Wait! I still have the blueprints! Let's go, Exile!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaContractThreeEncounterEnd.ogg]]

#### Breaking the Unbreakable_2
The Unbreakable has been broken. You know what that means, don't you? The Templar didn't build it right. I'll have to continue my work to prove it can be done!
![[Isla, the Engineer - Breaking the Unbreakable_2.ogg]]

#### IslaSelectedContractOne
My mental gears are already turning!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSelectedContractOne.ogg]]

#### IslaSelectedContractTwo
Creative solutions on the fly!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSelectedContractTwo.ogg]]

#### IslaSelectedContractThree
Long as I can bring my gadgets.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSelectedContractThree.ogg]]

#### IslaSelectedBlueprintOne
Did someone say my name?
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSelectedBlueprintOne.ogg]]

#### IslaSelectedBlueprintTwo
Engineer, reporting!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSelectedBlueprintTwo.ogg]]

#### IslaSelectedBlueprintThree
Just tell me where to build!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSelectedBlueprintThree.ogg]]

#### IslaEngineeringOne
A simple solution!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaEngineeringOne.ogg]]

#### IslaEngineeringTwo
Just a matter of math!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaEngineeringTwo.ogg]]

#### IslaEngineeringThree
Hardly a hurdle!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaEngineeringThree.ogg]]

#### IslaEngineeringFour
The axles and the gears go 'round and 'round...
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaEngineeringFour.ogg]]

#### IslaEngineeringFive
You put the axle in, you take the ball-bearing out...
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaEngineeringFive.ogg]]

#### IslaEngineeringSix
Sometimes there's an elegant solution... sometimes.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaEngineeringSix.ogg]]

#### IslaEngineeringSeven
I've got just the contraption for this!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaEngineeringSeven.ogg]]

#### IslaEngineeringEight
Leave it to your engineer.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaEngineeringEight.ogg]]

#### IslaEngineeringLoudOne
Alright, alright!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaEngineeringLoudOne.ogg]]

#### IslaEngineeringLoudTwo
Carry the seven...
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaEngineeringLoudTwo.ogg]]

#### IslaEngineeringLoudThree
Such awful racket!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaEngineeringLoudThree.ogg]]

#### IslaEngineeringLoudFour
Must go faster, must go faster.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaEngineeringLoudFour.ogg]]

#### IslaEngineeringLoudFive
Can't think with all that racket!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaEngineeringLoudFive.ogg]]

#### IslaEngineeringLoudSix
You can't rush engineering!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaEngineeringLoudSix.ogg]]

#### IslaEngineeringLoudSeven
I'll do what I can!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaEngineeringLoudSeven.ogg]]

#### IslaDisarmTrapOne
Time to take it apart!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaDisarmTrapOne.ogg]]

#### IslaDisarmTrapTwo
Let's throw a wrench in the works.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaDisarmTrapTwo.ogg]]

#### IslaDisarmTrapThree
My turn!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaDisarmTrapThree.ogg]]

#### IslaDisarmTrapFour
Construction, deconstruction... it's all the same, in the end.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaDisarmTrapFour.ogg]]

#### IslaDisarmTrapFive
A beautiful design. A shame I have to wreck it.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaDisarmTrapFive.ogg]]

#### IslaDisarmTrapSix
Traps are the arse end of engineering. No artisanship.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaDisarmTrapSix.ogg]]

#### IslaDisarmTrapLoudOne
Thrilling!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaDisarmTrapLoudOne.ogg]]

#### IslaDisarmTrapLoudTwo
The fun part!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaDisarmTrapLoudTwo.ogg]]

#### IslaDisarmTrapLoudThree
Careful and quick!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaDisarmTrapLoudThree.ogg]]

#### IslaDisarmTrapLoudFour
I'm just going to smack it with a wrench!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaDisarmTrapLoudFour.ogg]]

#### IslaDisarmTrapLoudFive
Poor parts, bad craftsmanship!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaDisarmTrapLoudFive.ogg]]

#### IslaDisarmTrapLoudSix
I can't even hear myself think!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaDisarmTrapLoudSix.ogg]]

#### IslaCounterThaumaturgyOne
Open your mind...
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaCounterThaumaturgyOne.ogg]]

#### IslaCounterThaumaturgyTwo
Empty-headed, that one.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaCounterThaumaturgyTwo.ogg]]

#### IslaCounterThaumaturgyThree
Mind-contraption, activate!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaCounterThaumaturgyThree.ogg]]

#### IslaCounterThaumaturgyFour
The mind is just another system of gears.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaCounterThaumaturgyFour.ogg]]

#### IslaCounterThaumaturgyFive
Your mental machinery is mine to mould!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaCounterThaumaturgyFive.ogg]]

#### IslaCounterThaumaturgySix
Statistically, this should work.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaCounterThaumaturgySix.ogg]]

#### IslaCounterThaumaturgyLoudOne
Too loud to think!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaCounterThaumaturgyLoudOne.ogg]]

#### IslaCounterThaumaturgyLoudTwo
Can't rush this!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaCounterThaumaturgyLoudTwo.ogg]]

#### IslaCounterThaumaturgyLoudThree
Ack!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaCounterThaumaturgyLoudThree.ogg]]

#### IslaCounterThaumaturgyLoudFour
Let's hope this works!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaCounterThaumaturgyLoudFour.ogg]]

#### IslaCounterThaumaturgyLoudFive
Bloody racket, can't think!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaCounterThaumaturgyLoudFive.ogg]]

#### IslaCounterThaumaturgyLoudSix
I'll do my best!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaCounterThaumaturgyLoudSix.ogg]]

#### IslaBusyOne
Just a moment.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaBusyOne.ogg]]

#### IslaBusyTwo
A moment please.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaBusyTwo.ogg]]

#### IslaBusyThree
I'm in the middle of something.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaBusyThree.ogg]]

#### IslaBusyFour
I'm engaged already.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaBusyFour.ogg]]

#### IslaBusyFive
One job at a time!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaBusyFive.ogg]]

#### IslaBusyLoudOne
I'm working!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaBusyLoudOne.ogg]]

#### IslaBusyLoudTwo
I'm on the job already!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaBusyLoudTwo.ogg]]

#### IslaBusyLoudThree
Don't deviate from the plan!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaBusyLoudThree.ogg]]

#### IslaBusyLoudFour
Machines have a limit!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaBusyLoudFour.ogg]]

#### IslaBusyLoudFive
I can't, I can't!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaBusyLoudFive.ogg]]

#### IslaInterruptedOne
They're touching me!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaInterruptedOne.ogg]]

#### IslaInterruptedTwo
Aren't you supposed to defend your engineer?!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaInterruptedTwo.ogg]]

#### IslaInterruptedThree
They're in my personal space!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaInterruptedThree.ogg]]

#### IslaInterruptedFour
I can't think when I'm under attack!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaInterruptedFour.ogg]]

#### IslaInterruptedLoudOne
Get them away from me!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaInterruptedLoudOne.ogg]]

#### IslaInterruptedLoudTwo
They're going to deconstruct me!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaInterruptedLoudTwo.ogg]]

#### IslaInterruptedLoudThree
Personal space, personal space!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaInterruptedLoudThree.ogg]]

#### IslaInterruptedLoudFour
This plan is crumbling!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaInterruptedLoudFour.ogg]]

#### IslaCombatStartOne
We've been sighted!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaCombatStartOne.ogg]]

#### IslaCombatStartTwo
Oh my, someone must do the fighting now.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaCombatStartTwo.ogg]]

#### IslaCombatStartThree
I hope you don't expect me to fight.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaCombatStartThree.ogg]]

#### IslaCombatStartFour
A better plan would have avoided this.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaCombatStartFour.ogg]]

#### IslaCombatStartFive
Not good. Not good at all!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaCombatStartFive.ogg]]

#### IslaCombatStartLoudOne
Enemies approaching!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaCombatStartLoudOne.ogg]]

#### IslaCombatStartLoudTwo
Don't let them touch me!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaCombatStartLoudTwo.ogg]]

#### IslaCombatStartLoudThree
The jig's up!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaCombatStartLoudThree.ogg]]

#### IslaCombatStartLoudFour
Consarn it, a fight's on!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaCombatStartLoudFour.ogg]]

#### IslaCombatStartLoudFive
Zooterkins, here comes a beating!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaCombatStartLoudFive.ogg]]

#### IslaCombatEndOne
We... survived?
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaCombatEndOne.ogg]]

#### IslaCombatEndTwo
Interesting tactics.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaCombatEndTwo.ogg]]

#### IslaCombatEndThree
Their strategy was incorrect.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaCombatEndThree.ogg]]

#### IslaCombatEndFour
They made a tactical error.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaCombatEndFour.ogg]]

#### IslaCombatEndFive
They should have thought this through.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaCombatEndFive.ogg]]

#### IslaCombatEndLoudOne
Violence complete!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaCombatEndLoudOne.ogg]]

#### IslaCombatEndLoudTwo
Continue with the plan!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaCombatEndLoudTwo.ogg]]

#### IslaCombatEndLoudThree
No time to waste!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaCombatEndLoudThree.ogg]]

#### IslaCombatEndLoudFour
Like clockwork!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaCombatEndLoudFour.ogg]]

#### IslaCombatEndLoudFive
Must get back on schedule!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaCombatEndLoudFive.ogg]]

#### IslaLootingOne
That'll fund a few inventions.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaLootingOne.ogg]]

#### IslaLootingTwo
If they cannot prevent us from taking it, it is ours.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaLootingTwo.ogg]]

#### IslaLootingThree
A good plan reaps its own rewards.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaLootingThree.ogg]]

#### IslaLootingFour
Don't deviate too much.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaLootingFour.ogg]]

#### IslaLootingFive
I believe they call that loot.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaLootingFive.ogg]]

#### IslaLootingLoudOne
Treasure. Check. Keep moving.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaLootingLoudOne.ogg]]

#### IslaLootingLoudTwo
The plan was to get treasure before the alarm!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaLootingLoudTwo.ogg]]

#### IslaLootingLoudThree
Now's not the time for looting!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaLootingLoudThree.ogg]]

#### IslaLootingLoudFour
We get nothing if the plan fails!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaLootingLoudFour.ogg]]

#### IslaLootingLoudFive
Why are you doing that now?!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaLootingLoudFive.ogg]]

#### IslaAlertThresholdOne
We're at the limits of our plan now.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaAlertThresholdOne.ogg]]

#### IslaAlertThresholdTwo
This clock is on the verge of chiming...
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaAlertThresholdTwo.ogg]]

#### IslaAlertThresholdThree
We can afford no more unanticipated variables.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaAlertThresholdThree.ogg]]

#### IslaAlertThresholdFour
We will be detected if we are not careful.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaAlertThresholdFour.ogg]]

#### IslaAlarmOne
The clock chimes at the appointed hour!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaAlarmOne.ogg]]

#### IslaAlarmTwo
According to plan.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaAlarmTwo.ogg]]

#### IslaAlarmThree
Right on cue.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaAlarmThree.ogg]]

#### IslaEarlyAlarmOne
I don't like surprises!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaEarlyAlarmOne.ogg]]

#### IslaEarlyAlarmTwo
This wasn't the plan!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaEarlyAlarmTwo.ogg]]

#### IslaEarlyAlarmThree
Our design appears to have been flawed!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaEarlyAlarmThree.ogg]]

#### IslaFinalRoomOne
Flawless execution... so far.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaFinalRoomOne.ogg]]

#### IslaFinalRoomTwo
Phase one complete. Acquire the treasure.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaFinalRoomTwo.ogg]]

#### IslaFinalRoomThree
Remember, this is only the midpoint.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaFinalRoomThree.ogg]]

#### IslaFinalRoomFour
From the blueprints, I thought it'd be bigger.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaFinalRoomFour.ogg]]

#### IslaFinalRoomFive
I haven't even used half my contraptions yet!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaFinalRoomFive.ogg]]

#### IslaFinalRoomLoudOne
No time!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaFinalRoomLoudOne.ogg]]

#### IslaFinalRoomLoudTwo
Accelerate the plan!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaFinalRoomLoudTwo.ogg]]

#### IslaFinalRoomLoudThree
Timetable's up!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaFinalRoomLoudThree.ogg]]

#### IslaFinalRoomLoudFour
Move quickly!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaFinalRoomLoudFour.ogg]]

#### IslaFinalRoomLoudFive
Hurry!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaFinalRoomLoudFive.ogg]]

#### IslaObjectiveLootedOne
Objective achieved!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaObjectiveLootedOne.ogg]]

#### IslaObjectiveLootedTwo
Apex of the plan accomplished. Now, to survive!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaObjectiveLootedTwo.ogg]]

#### IslaObjectiveLootedThree
Phase two begins now!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaObjectiveLootedThree.ogg]]

#### IslaObjectiveLootedFour
Oh, that's it? Hmm.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaObjectiveLootedFour.ogg]]

#### IslaObjectiveLootedLoudOne
I recommend flight!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaObjectiveLootedLoudOne.ogg]]

#### IslaObjectiveLootedLoudTwo
Time to flee!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaObjectiveLootedLoudTwo.ogg]]

#### IslaObjectiveLootedLoudThree
Let's run!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaObjectiveLootedLoudThree.ogg]]

#### IslaObjectiveLootedLoudFour
Got it? Let's go!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaObjectiveLootedLoudFour.ogg]]

#### IslaEntryBanterOne
A strong plan is the best path to success.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaEntryBanterOne.ogg]]

#### IslaEntryBanterTwo
We can account for all the variables. No deviating!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaEntryBanterTwo.ogg]]

#### IslaEntryBanterThree
I hope I get to use my contraptions.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaEntryBanterThree.ogg]]

#### IslaEntryBanterFour
Is this the part where we make nervous small talk?
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaEntryBanterFour.ogg]]

#### IslaEntryBanterFive
You do know what you're doing, yes?
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaEntryBanterFive.ogg]]

#### IslaExitBanterOne
The real treasure is the knowledge we gleaned along the way!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaExitBanterOne.ogg]]

#### IslaExitBanterTwo
Does this mean we're friends now?
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaExitBanterTwo.ogg]]

#### IslaExitBanterThree
Is this the part where we make relieved small talk?
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaExitBanterThree.ogg]]

#### IslaExitBanterFour
Plan, execute, success! I love logic!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaExitBanterFour.ogg]]

#### IslaExitBanterFive
This has inspired an idea for a new invention!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaExitBanterFive.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterKuraiIslaReply
...Of course.
![[Isla, the Engineer - SelectionBanterKuraiIslaReply.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterKuraiIslaReplyTwo
I'm always thinking about my inventions.
![[Isla, the Engineer - SelectionBanterKuraiIslaReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterIslaToKurai
Let's get to it!
![[Isla, the Engineer - SelectionBanterIslaToKurai.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterIslaToKuraiTwo
I better be! We've only got a few hours!
![[Isla, the Engineer - SelectionBanterIslaToKuraiTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterIslaToKuraiThree
It's not a major concern. The spores are currently harmless. Just have to be back to my devices before my vivarium germinates.
![[Isla, the Engineer - SelectionBanterIslaToKuraiThree.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterIslaToKuraiFour
Hurry now, let's get the job done!
![[Isla, the Engineer - SelectionBanterIslaToKuraiFour.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNenetIslaReply
Is it a tunk... tunk... tunk, or more of a tick, tick, tick?
![[Isla, the Engineer - SelectionBanterNenetIslaReply.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNenetIslaReplyTwo
You can hear that?
![[Isla, the Engineer - SelectionBanterNenetIslaReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNenetIslaReplyThree
Indeed!
![[Isla, the Engineer - SelectionBanterNenetIslaReplyThree.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNenetIslaReplyFour
Oh no, that won't go off for several hours, probably.
![[Isla, the Engineer - SelectionBanterNenetIslaReplyFour.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterIslaToNenet
Oh, Nenet, there you are. I had a minor breakthrough on that humanoid golem you asked for.
![[Isla, the Engineer - SelectionBanterIslaToNenet.ogg]]

The thing is, I can't get his movement right. He's as stiff as granite, which is to be expected. Also, he doesn't cook very well.

#### SelectionBanterNilesIslaReply
About what?
![[Isla, the Engineer - SelectionBanterNilesIslaReply.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNilesIslaReplyTwo
One of my machines detects divine energies. Divinity is real.
![[Isla, the Engineer - SelectionBanterNilesIslaReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterIslaToNiles
If I use two parts Voltaxic Sulphite with three parts Trarthan... oh my, who are you?
![[Isla, the Engineer - SelectionBanterIslaToNiles.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterIslaToNilesTwo
Oh yes, yes, I have trouble with faces. Especially handsome faces.
![[Isla, the Engineer - SelectionBanterIslaToNilesTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterIslaToNilesThree
The human body is just another machine, my dear... joints... pistons...

#### SelectionBanterVinderiIslaReply
Oh, hello!
![[Isla, the Engineer - SelectionBanterVinderiIslaReply.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterVinderiIslaReplyTwo
My inventions aren't supposed to explode.
![[Isla, the Engineer - SelectionBanterVinderiIslaReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterVinderiIslaReplyThree
Then compete we shall!
![[Isla, the Engineer - SelectionBanterVinderiIslaReplyThree.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterIslaToVinderi
Hello. What's your name again?
![[Isla, the Engineer - SelectionBanterIslaToVinderi.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterIslaToVinderiTwo
I'm bad with names.
![[Isla, the Engineer - SelectionBanterIslaToVinderiTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterHuckIslaReply
Oh my.
![[Isla, the Engineer - SelectionBanterHuckIslaReply.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterHuckIslaReplyTwo
Of course.
![[Isla, the Engineer - SelectionBanterHuckIslaReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterIslaToHuck
You wanted to see me, Huck?
![[Isla, the Engineer - SelectionBanterIslaToHuck.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterIslaToHuckTwo
Oh, there's a job on.
![[Isla, the Engineer - SelectionBanterIslaToHuckTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterGiannaIslaReply
Inventions are, by definition, new!
![[Isla, the Engineer - SelectionBanterGiannaIslaReply.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterIslaToGianna
Can I bring my glowing red rocks along on this mission?
![[Isla, the Engineer - SelectionBanterIslaToGianna.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterIslaToGiannaTwo
The rocks don't make people sick. It's the Corruption they leak that does that.
![[Isla, the Engineer - SelectionBanterIslaToGiannaTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterIslaToGiannaThree
Wear a dress lined with six-inch-thick armour and you'll be fine.

#### EntryBanterIslaToNenetTwo
That's my girl!
![[Isla, the Engineer - EntryBanterIslaToNenetTwo.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterNilesIslaReply
As you should!
![[Isla, the Engineer - EntryBanterNilesIslaReply.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterIslaToNiles
Niles, have you thought about those interrogation devices I suggested?
![[Isla, the Engineer - EntryBanterIslaToNiles.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterIslaToNilesTwo
You think I've got a pleasant smile?
![[Isla, the Engineer - EntryBanterIslaToNilesTwo.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterHuckIslaReply
How about you go in front instead of behind us?
![[Isla, the Engineer - EntryBanterHuckIslaReply.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterIslaToHuck
You can rely on my contraptions, Huck! Have no fear!
![[Isla, the Engineer - EntryBanterIslaToHuck.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterIslaToHuckTwo
So does Voltaxic-powered battle armour!
![[Isla, the Engineer - EntryBanterIslaToHuckTwo.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterIslaToHuckThree
That's what they all say...
![[Isla, the Engineer - EntryBanterIslaToHuckThree.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterVinderiIslaReply
But then what would we take? Oh, the scrap! Of course!
![[Isla, the Engineer - EntryBanterVinderiIslaReply.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterIslaToVinderi
Just remember when we're in there, combustion is the mother of invention!
![[Isla, the Engineer - EntryBanterIslaToVinderi.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterGiannaIslaReply
An enormous mirror--
![[Isla, the Engineer - EntryBanterGiannaIslaReply.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterGiannaIslaReplyTwo
--that focuses all the light to a white-hot point, and sets everything it touches on fire!
![[Isla, the Engineer - EntryBanterGiannaIslaReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterIslaToGianna
I'll be watching your art. I'm not great with people.
![[Isla, the Engineer - EntryBanterIslaToGianna.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterIslaToGiannaTwo
You're so eloquent!
![[Isla, the Engineer - EntryBanterIslaToGiannaTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterNenetIslaReply
Told you I'd never let anything happen to you.
![[Isla, the Engineer - ExitBanterNenetIslaReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterIslaToNenet
Your skills and my inventions carried the day!
![[Isla, the Engineer - ExitBanterIslaToNenet.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterIslaToNenetTwo
That's what science is for!
![[Isla, the Engineer - ExitBanterIslaToNenetTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterNilesIslaReply
Nonsense. A good plan always succeeds.
![[Isla, the Engineer - ExitBanterNilesIslaReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterNilesIslaReplyTwo
Oops, did I not tell you the contingencies? No wonder you were terrified!
![[Isla, the Engineer - ExitBanterNilesIslaReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterIslaToNiles
That was impressive. I should study your brain.
![[Isla, the Engineer - ExitBanterIslaToNiles.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterIslaToNilesTwo
No drills, I promise. I could do it with a trepan.
![[Isla, the Engineer - ExitBanterIslaToNilesTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterHuckIslaReply
I could replace your muscles with pistons if you like.
![[Isla, the Engineer - ExitBanterHuckIslaReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterIslaToHuck
Your chances for survival would have been much better with my Voltaxic-powered battle armour.
![[Isla, the Engineer - ExitBanterIslaToHuck.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterIslaToHuckTwo
I thought you were STRONGER than a mannequin...

#### ExitBanterVinderiIslaReply
We just did the mission. We're going home now.
![[Isla, the Engineer - ExitBanterVinderiIslaReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterIslaToVinderi
What are you going to do with your share, Vinderi?
![[Isla, the Engineer - ExitBanterIslaToVinderi.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterIslaToVinderiTwo
Can I come take notes?
![[Isla, the Engineer - ExitBanterIslaToVinderiTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterGiannaIslaReply
If I'm not making people cower in terror from the inexplicability of my inventions, then I'm not really doing science right!
![[Isla, the Engineer - ExitBanterGiannaIslaReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterIslaToGianna
If I copy what you did with your art, will I have the same effect on men?
![[Isla, the Engineer - ExitBanterIslaToGianna.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterIslaToGiannaTwo
First thing I'm going to do is go terrorise Niles some more.
![[Isla, the Engineer - ExitBanterIslaToGiannaTwo.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersHeistMetNotBuilt
Oh, hello! I'm Isla. Have we met? I always forget a face, as they say. Oh, yes... we {definitely don't know each other.} I'm hoping to sign on as an engineer here, and I don't have {any other job.} Just like you. {Wink!} If you build the proper facilities, I can put together all sorts of contraptions you might find useful!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersHeistMetNotBuilt.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersHeistNotMetNotBuilt
Oh, hello! Have we met? I always forget a face, as they say. I'd like to sign on here as an engineer. I can build all sorts of contraptions you might find useful. We would need the proper facilities, however. Until then, there's not much I can do. Can't have my inventions getting rained on!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersHeistNotMetNotBuilt.ogg]]

#### Introduction_2
Oh, hello! I'm Isla. Have we met? I always forget a face, as they say. Oh, yes... we {definitely don't know each other.} I'm the engineer here, and I don't {any other job.} Just like you. {Wink!}
![[Isla, the Engineer - Introduction_2.ogg]]

#### Introduction_3
Oh, hello! Have we met? I always forget a face, as they say. I'm Isla, your local engineer! I specialise in contraptions, devices, inventions, and gadgets!
![[Isla, the Engineer - Introduction_3.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersBeforeBuildingBuilt
I'm tinkering with what I have, but we're going to need some investment before I can get a proper facility up and running.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersBeforeBuildingBuilt.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersRecombinatorIntro
I've always had a {penchant} for taking things apart. You could say I'm something of a savant, if I do flatter myself. On the other hand, I've spent most of my life studying how to put things back together again, with... mixed results. The thing is, that actually might be quite useful to you. I've drawn plans for a device. A disassembling-reassembling contraption. It could take things apart, and put them back together differently, {on purpose.} It's my own personal talent in machine form. I call it 'The Isla-nator!' If you're interested in funding such a project, just let me know.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersRecombinatorIntro.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersUnlockRecombinator
Ooh, I'm so excited! Stage one of the 'Isla-nator' can only... {recombinate} weapons, but I'm sure you'll have lots of fun with that! Recombinate... {recombinate...} such a pleasurable word...
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersUnlockRecombinator.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersUpgradeArmour
Stage two of the Recombinator I'm calling it the Recombinator now! can disassemble and reassemble armour. With another upgrade, it could do even more!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersUpgradeArmour.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersUpgradeJewellery
Stage three! Time to throw all your prettiest rings and necklaces into the Recombinator!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersUpgradeJewellery.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersUpgradeCost
I've restructured some internal mechanisms. The {recombination} process should be more efficient now!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersUpgradeCost.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersUpgradeTier
With all the work I've done on the Recombinator, it's starting to reassemble things better than they were before! That's... actually quite concerning, to a woman of science...
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersUpgradeTier.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersUpgradeKeepMods
That's it! The Recombinator is complete! It defies known science in a few fundamental ways, but I'm not about to take it apart to find out why... no matter how tempting that might be...
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersUpgradeKeepMods.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersMappingIntro
There are rumours that you're venturing into the Atlas. Oh, yes, I know all about that. It was twenty years ago, now, that I had the opportunity to work on a map device. I wasn't the one that put it together, but I learned quite a bit by taking it apart. This older, wiser Isla might be able to build one for you... with the proper investment.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersMappingIntro.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersUnlockMapping
Here it is! This prototype map device can only maintain two portals, but I'm quite proud of it. My interplanar bridges are also more like... tubes... than doorways, so whoever uses it will have to more or less... {slide...} but the important thing is that it works!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersUnlockMapping.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersMapUpgradePortalsOne
I've added more power couplers, and now it should be able to maintain four portals. The ride might be a little bumpier, but that's why we don't test these contraptions ourselves!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersMapUpgradePortalsOne.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersMapUpgradePortalsTwo
MORE POWER!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersMapUpgradePortalsTwo.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersMapUpgradeYellow
I've added more danger to the device, as requested!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersMapUpgradeYellow.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersMapUpgradeRed
We can now extend the reach of our interplanar tubes. They're gonna slide right into horrible dangers, just like you wanted!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersMapUpgradeRed.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersMapUpgradeHardMaps
I've overclocked the power cores. We should be able to plumb the darkest and deadliest depths of the Atlas now! How exciting!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersMapUpgradeHardMaps.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersMapUpgradeDeviceOne
Now we can operate a second map device! This one's even using custom-made parts, instead of pieces I oh, no, Isla, don't mention {that...}
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersMapUpgradeDeviceOne.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersMapUpgradeDeviceTwo
With parts smithed by Dannig and your generous investment, we've finally been able to complete a third map device!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersMapUpgradeDeviceTwo.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersMapUpgradeSpeed
Ooh, it's finally time to implement my Minion I mean, Labourer Incentives Program!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersMapUpgradeSpeed.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersMapUpgradeExtra
I've altered a few of the mechanisms. Don't worry, it {should} be safe.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersMapUpgradeExtra.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersMapUpgradeFinal
I now consider my prototypes complete! With my interplanar tubes, you can slide into any of a thousand different maps! Oh, Isla, you've certainly outdone yourself this time!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersMapUpgradeFinal.ogg]]

#### The Recombinator
Place equipment in the Recombinator. Like matches with like. The machine will break the objects down into their constituent components, then try to reintegrate them as one fresh new piece. It's simply genius!
![[Isla, the Engineer - The Recombinator.ogg]]

#### Map Running
With these facilities, any runners you assign will go through my portals and explore the Atlas. They'll bring back all sorts of treasures, and you can collect the gains at your leisure! It sure beats stealing... not that... either of us would ever be involved in anything like that.
![[Isla, the Engineer - Map Running.ogg]]

#### Previous Experience
Twenty years ago, when I was in my first year, a certain High Templar picked me out of a crowd of Academy engineers. I was taken to the Chief Arkhon's laboratory, among other staff and guards. That building held a functioning map device, and it was my job to repair and maintain it. Several terrible things happened there... but I learned more high science on that single job than I would have in years at the university! Good thing, too...
![[Isla, the Engineer - Previous Experience.ogg]]

#### Oriath
I heard about Oriath. I've no love for that city. I... wasn't treated very well there...
![[Isla, the Engineer - Oriath.ogg]]

#### Kingsmarch
This place is going to be grand! When that handsome Dannig spins his tales about the years to come, I can see it as clearly as I see my inventions in my head. I'd rather be working here than for the Templars any day.
![[Isla, the Engineer - Kingsmarch.ogg]]

#### The Ring
{Hush!} We can't have anybody overhearing that kind of business!
![[Isla, the Engineer - The Ring.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersRecruited
You want {me} to be your engineer? This 'Kingsmarch' sounds like a place for a proper and upstanding job. Been awhile since I had one of those. Hmm... I'll give it a look.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersRecruited.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersIntroInHeist
Got somethin' needs made? Or unmade? I can take 'em apart fast as I oh, it's you! I hope you won't hold this moonlighting against me... science is a costly business. An inventor's got to make ends meet! All's fair, I won't even ask what's brought you here. Welcome.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersIntroInHeist.ogg]]

#### Oil-smudged Letter
I'm so happy you're alive! I always wondered what happened to you. A shame about your father. He was the smartest man I've ever known. Of course I'll keep you apprised of my progress with the map devices! We should definitely correspond about the strange effect Kalguuran runes have on portals. I'll send more in my next letter.
![[Isla, the Engineer - Oil-smudged Letter.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersWildBuildingReaction
My very own {invention-atorium!}
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersWildBuildingReaction.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersWildApproach_Random
Oh, hello there!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersWildApproach_Random.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersWildApproach_5
Why hello!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersWildApproach_5.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersWildApproach_9
Just a little tighter... oops.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersWildApproach_9.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersWildApproach_12
What was I doing again?
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersWildApproach_12.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersWildRecombinate_Random
Activate the machine!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersWildRecombinate_Random.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersWildRecombinate_5
All circuits are go!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersWildRecombinate_5.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersWildRecombinate_9
That's an interesting result.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersWildRecombinate_9.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersWildRecombinate_12
What'd you get?
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersWildRecombinate_12.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersWildRecombinate_15
Hmm, I'll add this result to my log.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersWildRecombinate_15.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersWildRecombinate_19
Fire the main cannon!... Oops, wrong machine.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersWildRecombinate_19.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersWildRecombinate_22
Oooo!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersWildRecombinate_22.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersWildRecombinate_25
Did you hear that clanging?
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersWildRecombinate_25.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersWildRecombinate_29
That's definitely supposed to happen.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersWildRecombinate_29.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersWildRecombinate_30
That's... definitely supposed to happen.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersWildRecombinate_30.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersWildRecombinate_33
Did you feel that? Maybe it was just me...
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersWildRecombinate_33.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersWildRecombinate_36
My hair is standing on end!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersWildRecombinate_36.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersWildRecombinate_40
{You put the left one in, you put the right one in, then you take a shiny out...}
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersWildRecombinate_40.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersWildLootAvailable_Random
The runners have brought back some interesting things!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersWildLootAvailable_Random.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersWildLootAvailable_5
There's a whole load of baubles ready to be looted!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersWildLootAvailable_5.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersWildLootAvailable_9
Don't forget, you've got a bit of treasure to fetch!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersWildLootAvailable_9.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersWildLootAvailable_13
You've left something valuable in the device!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersWildLootAvailable_13.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersWildLootAvailable_17
They've brought back some things from the Atlas.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersWildLootAvailable_17.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersWildToHerself_Random
Hmm... but the angular momentum...
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersWildToHerself_Random.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersWildToHerself_4
Maybe if I attached several blades...
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersWildToHerself_4.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersWildToHerself_7
Come on, Isla, think it through!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersWildToHerself_7.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersWildToHerself_10
Now what was I thinking about just now?
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersWildToHerself_10.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersWildToHerself_13
Yes... yes... the perfect excuse to see Dannig...
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersWildToHerself_13.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersConvoWithDannigOne
Are you going to sing any songs for us tonight, Dannig?
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersConvoWithDannigOne.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersConvoWithDannigTwo
Oh, hoo wow!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersConvoWithDannigTwo.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersConvoWithFaustusOne
Nice to meet you! Faustus, is it?
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersConvoWithFaustusOne.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersConvoWithFaustusTwo
Indeed. We have encountered each other here in Kingsmarch for the first time!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersConvoWithFaustusTwo.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersConvoWithRogOne
Rog, I've heard you play a game with figurines, and lots of dice?
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersConvoWithRogOne.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersConvoWithRogTwo
Oh my. {Roleplaying?} Will Dannig be there?
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersConvoWithRogTwo.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersConvoWithTujen
I've got some good news and some bad news. The good news is, it does propel itself.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersConvoWithTujen.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersConvoWithRaulfOne
What was your name again? I've trouble with names. It's Ralph, right?
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersConvoWithRaulfOne.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersConvoWithRaulfTwo
But that's not how the others pronounce it when you're not around! How strange.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersConvoWithRaulfTwo.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersConvoWithSonjaOne
It's only because Johan wouldn't let me attach a proper reactor!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersConvoWithSonjaOne.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersConvoWithSonjaTwo
Yes, yes, but they don't all explode!
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersConvoWithSonjaTwo.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersConvoWithJohan
Ha! It's my day off.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersConvoWithJohan.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersConvoWithGwennenOne
There's no chance involved when it comes to science! Except at the smallest level.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersConvoWithGwennenOne.ogg]]

#### IslaSettlersConvoWithGwennenTwo
That's very poignant.
![[Isla, the Engineer - IslaSettlersConvoWithGwennenTwo.ogg]]
