## Rhodri
#### RhodriIntroduction
Rhodri's my name. I'm the first mate. Don't get in my way, and we'll be alright.
![[Rhodri - RhodriIntroduction.ogg]]

#### RhodriCrew
If the crew doesn't despise the first mate, then he ain't doin' his job. That bein' said, I'd lay down my life for any of my men, the captain included. Just how it is. Here's hopin' I don't have to, though.

#### G4RhodriRowingG4_1_1
Anyone who comes too close to this place gets torn to shreds. Speaking of which... I think this is a good distance for me to drop you off.
![[Rhodri - G4RhodriRowingG4_1_1.ogg]]

#### G4RhodriRowingG4_2_1
So many shipwrecks... imagine the treasures within... but all the coin in the world wouldn't be enough to get me to dive into those waters... did you hear that? I swear I heard... no, but it couldn't be... she's been dead for fifteen years...
![[Rhodri - G4RhodriRowingG4_2_1.ogg]]

#### G4RhodriRowingG4_3_1
I'm considerin' makin' landfall with you. These people are... very friendly. Had a right good time last visit - how strange! They seem to have left a bunch of {waikoama} to rot on the beach... that's 'canoes' in Karui. Don't mind me. Learned a bit o' culture to impress the ladies here.
![[Rhodri - G4RhodriRowingG4_3_1.ogg]]

#### G4RhodriRowingG4_7
You see those Karui rotting on the rocks there? Damn fools, they are. Sneakin' here and stealin' eggs is some sort of test of manhood, Makoru tells me. The Kalguuran rite of manhood involves getting drunk with your family at a tavern. Much prefer that over bein' stabbed by a Shrike.

#### G4RhodriHaventHiredYetIntro
Eh? You'll have to speak to Rog about setting up a charter account. We can't do business if you don't have one. It's Trade Guild law.
![[Rhodri - G4RhodriHaventHiredYetIntro.ogg]]

#### G4RhodriBackHaventHiredYetIntro
Got a charter account now? Good. Deal with the captain. I'm the first mate. Rhodri's my name. Don't get in my way, and we'll be alright.
![[Rhodri - G4RhodriBackHaventHiredYetIntro.ogg]]

#### G4RhodriAboutMakoru
We've served a few years together, but I always tried to look out for her, even when she was just a new deckhand with no experience on large vessels. Gave her a piece of advice now and then. We Kalguurans can be a bit hard-headed when it comes to foreigners. When she worked her way up in the Trade Guild, I wasn't surprised. When she passed the Captain's Challenge with a unanimous vote, I was right proud. Never took the Challenge meself, though. Happy where I am. Much prefer she serve as Captain, and I'll just continue being a grumpy old cur shoutin' at the crew.

#### G4RhodriAboutTradeGuild
We all operate under the Meridian Free Traders. We gather what resources and wealth we can here, send it back home, get a cut. Decent charter. Could do worse. That Rog has stuck his neck out repeatedly to keep the terms fair for the sailors. Maybe that's why it ain't so bad.

#### G4RhodriAboutTheKing
Oi, don't go askin' me about {him}. I was just startin' to like you.
![[Rhodri - G4RhodriAboutTheKing.ogg]]

#### RhodriA4_Wild_Interrupt_Random
Oh. Okay then.
![[Rhodri - RhodriA4_Wild_Interrupt_Random.ogg]]

#### RhodriA4_Wild_Interrupt_2
Okay then.
![[Rhodri - RhodriA4_Wild_Interrupt_2.ogg]]

#### RhodriA4_Wild_Interrupt_4
Fine. Run on then.
![[Rhodri - RhodriA4_Wild_Interrupt_4.ogg]]

#### RhodriA4_Wild_Interrupt_7
Guess I'm chopped cabbage.
![[Rhodri - RhodriA4_Wild_Interrupt_7.ogg]]

#### RhodriA4_Wild_Interrupt_10
Talkin' to myself, I am.
![[Rhodri - RhodriA4_Wild_Interrupt_10.ogg]]

#### RhodriA4_Wild_Arastas
This place makes my skin crawl. Can't fathom all this 'gods' balderdash, let alone saviours and utopias. Ain't nobody comin' to save us from the burden we've already got back home.
![[Rhodri - RhodriA4_Wild_Arastas.ogg]]

#### RhodriA4_Wild_Hinekora
So... this is the entrance to the supposed Karui afterlife. Not sure I believe it. You'll have to let me know what you see down there. The concept of living on after death is just patently absurd to us Kalguurans... But whatever you do, if you ever meet him, don't mention this place to our King...
![[Rhodri - RhodriA4_Wild_Hinekora.ogg]]

#### RhodriA4_Wild_KedgeBay
So many shipwrecks... imagine the treasures within... but all the coin in the world wouldn't be enough to get me to dive into those waters... Did you hear that? I swear I heard... nah, but it couldn't be... she's been dead for fifteen years...
![[Rhodri - RhodriA4_Wild_KedgeBay.ogg]]

#### RhodriA4_Wild_IsleOfKin
Anyone who comes too close to this place usually gets torn to shreds. Speaking of which... I'll wait here. You run on ahead.
![[Rhodri - RhodriA4_Wild_IsleOfKin.ogg]]

#### RhodriA4_Wild_NgakanuFriendly
Ah, this is Makoru's home. The Karui are a proud people. They might not even let you in. In which case, we'll just go back - no harm, no foul. Don't go picking a fight...
![[Rhodri - RhodriA4_Wild_NgakanuFriendly.ogg]]

#### RhodriA4_Wild_NgakanuHostile
Something's not right... not right at all! Blood Fever. Madness. Blimey. Please, do whatever you can to save Makoru.
![[Rhodri - RhodriA4_Wild_NgakanuHostile.ogg]]

#### RhodriA4_Wild_Prison
Ugh, this place. Human misery, it was. They used to leave the prisoners in partially submerged cages, or so the stories go. Let the sea decide, they would say. Tread water for your life inside your cage. If the tide rose too high, you'd have to take breaths in between waves. Can't imagine that kind of desperation... Well, good luck with all that.
![[Rhodri - RhodriA4_Wild_Prison.ogg]]

#### RhodriA4_Wild_Tropical
How strange! They seem to have left a bunch of {waikoama} to rot on the beach... That's 'canoes' in Karui. Don't mind me. Learned a bit o' culture to impress the ladies here. Had a right good time last visit.
