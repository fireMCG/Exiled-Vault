#### RogTakeDealRandom
No need to wrap that up for you, I assume?
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogTakeDealRandom.ogg]]

#### RogTakeDeal2
No need to wrap that up for you, I assume.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogTakeDeal2.ogg]]

#### RogTakeDeal3
We both win.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogTakeDeal3.ogg]]

#### RogTakeDeal5
Good deal.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogTakeDeal5.ogg]]

#### RogTakeDeal7
Hope this helps.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogTakeDeal7.ogg]]

#### RogTakeDeal8
I hope this helps.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogTakeDeal8.ogg]]

#### RogTakeItemRandom
There you go.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogTakeItemRandom.ogg]]

#### RogTakeDeal11
Consider yourself supplied and equipped.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogTakeDeal11.ogg]]

#### RogTakeDeal13
You'll put it to earnest use, I hope?
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogTakeDeal13.ogg]]

#### RogIntroMarauder
I'm Rog. I specialise in logistics and planning. I don't know how you've survived out here on your own, but I'll do what I can to support you with my supply skills! From the back. Far from combat.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogIntroMarauder.ogg]]

#### RogIntroScion
I'm Rog. Tujen said you'd be heading this way! Said you're educated, ambitious. You're gonna fight for what's right, I just know it. I specialise in logistics and planning, so I'm happy to support you with my supply skills. Care to check out some of my deals?
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogIntroScion.ogg]]

#### RogIntroDuelist
I'm Rog. Gwennen said you'd be heading this way! Said you've got quite the moves. You're the kind of man that faces monsters with bravery and skill, are you? I prefer to avoid fighting, myself. This continent is fraught with danger. I specialise in logistics and planning, so I'm happy to support your fighting with my supply skills. Care to check out some of my deals?
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogIntroDuelist.ogg]]

#### RogFirstApproachShoutRandom
Hello there!
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogFirstApproachShoutRandom.ogg]]

#### RogOfferGenericRandom
I could improve this if you like...
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogOfferGenericRandom.ogg]]

#### RogOfferGeneric3
Care for an upgrade for a nominal fee?
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogOfferGeneric3.ogg]]

#### RogOfferDialogueWhiteSockets
I think I can scratch some of the paint off with my knife...
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogOfferDialogueWhiteSockets.ogg]]

#### RogOfferDialogueRedSockets
Perhaps red would work better for you? I'll just crush up a bit of dried Thornwolf heart and apply the powder.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogOfferDialogueRedSockets.ogg]]

#### RogOfferDialogueGreenSockets
Might you need a bit of green on this? I've a rare acid that I've noticed has an effect on the strange equipment in this realm.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogOfferDialogueGreenSockets.ogg]]

#### RogOfferDialogueBlueSockets
This would look better with a splash of blue. I've got a one-of-a-kind small mechanical artifact that can accomplish the job.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogOfferDialogueBlueSockets.ogg]]

#### RogOfferJewellers
Let's try to add more sockets to this, perhaps? You might end up with more spots for those ominous forbidden gems!
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogOfferJewellers.ogg]]

#### RogOfferFusings
Got a crate of Feasting Horror mandibles here. Uncertain of the 'vintage,' so to speak, but it might work out for you.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogOfferFusings.ogg]]

#### RogOfferChaos
This one needs a total overhaul. Shall we try for better?
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogOfferChaos.ogg]]

#### RogOfferVaal
As they say, you only live once! Take a risk!
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogOfferVaal.ogg]]

#### RogOfferAddModLucky
It's your lucky day, Exile!
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogOfferAddModLucky.ogg]]

#### RogOfferRerollSuffixes
Allow me to take my runed hammer to this thing's tail end. Can't get any worse, right?
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogOfferRerollSuffixes.ogg]]

#### RogOfferRerollPrefixes
I've a feeling that if I hammer on this thing's front end, I could knock some of its enchantments about a bit.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogOfferRerollPrefixes.ogg]]

#### RogOfferMaxOneMod
A small etched rune could have a beneficial effect here.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogOfferMaxOneMod.ogg]]

#### RogOfferDivineAllMods
A few small runes in the right places could do wonders here.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogOfferDivineAllMods.ogg]]

#### RogOfferBlessedOrb
This one's a bit banged up. I could try to repair it, but I'm no blacksmith.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogOfferBlessedOrb.ogg]]

#### RogOfferRemoveLowestLevelMod
A carefully applied rune of nullification could do wonders for this product's overall quality.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogOfferRemoveLowestLevelMod.ogg]]

#### RogOfferRemoveXLowestLevelMods
This one's quite messy. Shall I engrave multiple runes of nullification on it?
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogOfferRemoveXLowestLevelMods.ogg]]

#### RogOfferAddAPrefix
Something quite interesting happens when you apply a drop of Golden Chimeral blood to a piece of equipment...
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogOfferAddAPrefix.ogg]]

#### RogOfferAddAPrefixXTimes
I recently received a full shipment of rare Golden Chimeral blood. Shall we 'go for gold,' so to speak?
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogOfferAddAPrefixXTimes.ogg]]

#### RogOfferAddASuffix
Ever put a drop of Black Chimeral blood on a piece of equipment? I have. It's worth it, trust me.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogOfferAddASuffix.ogg]]

#### RogOfferAddASuffixXTimes
I've an entire vial of Black Chimeral blood in stock today. Could turn out very well for you.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogOfferAddASuffixXTimes.ogg]]

#### RogOffersToAddUpToMaximumMods
I like you, Exile. That's why I'm gonna offer you a premium deal, only for my favourite customers. Just don't ask how I do it!
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogOffersToAddUpToMaximumMods.ogg]]

#### RogOfferApplyIncubator
You're an investor. I can tell. You've an eye for a long-term payoff. Interested?
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogOfferApplyIncubator.ogg]]

#### RogOfferApplyCatalyst
One of my local contacts found some catalytic dust, but he died on the way back, so I don't know what kind it is. Shall we attempt to better your jewellery? Can't ruin it... I think.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogOfferApplyCatalyst.ogg]]

#### RogOfferTwentyQuality
Dannig says I've got to upsell you. Don't blame me, blame him. It's just the job. How about it, {friend?}
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogOfferTwentyQuality.ogg]]

#### RogOfferAnoint
I've got some exotic oil that's about to go bad. Using it on this for cheap seems better than letting it go to waste. Interested?
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogOfferAnoint.ogg]]

#### RogRerollInventoryRandom
I've always got more.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogRerollInventoryRandom.ogg]]

#### RogRerollInventory4
You want the premium deals, I see.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogRerollInventory4.ogg]]

#### RogRerollInventory7
A bit more stock.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogRerollInventory7.ogg]]

#### RogRerollInventory10
I'll make a figurine of you out of this scrap metal.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogRerollInventory10.ogg]]

#### RogSubsequentApproachShoutRandom
You're alive!
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogSubsequentApproachShoutRandom.ogg]]

#### RogSubsequentApproachShout4
Got another one for ya!
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogSubsequentApproachShout4.ogg]]

#### RogSubsequentApproachShout5
I've got another one for ya!
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogSubsequentApproachShout5.ogg]]

#### RogSubsequentApproachShout7
Hurry, there are monsters about!
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogSubsequentApproachShout7.ogg]]

#### RogHitsDetonatorRandom
I'll detonate them, hold on!
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogHitsDetonatorRandom.ogg]]

#### RogOrdersHirelingHitDetonatorRandom
Somebody plunge that detonator!
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogOrdersHirelingHitDetonatorRandom.ogg]]

#### RogBombPlacedGenericRandom
Good spot!
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogBombPlacedGenericRandom.ogg]]

#### RogBombPlacedMonstersRandom
Monsters lie in wait there...
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogBombPlacedMonstersRandom.ogg]]

#### RogBombPlacedMonsters3
I'd step back from that one.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogBombPlacedMonsters3.ogg]]

#### RogBombPlacedMonsters5
That's gonna wake the dead.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogBombPlacedMonsters5.ogg]]

#### RogBombPlacedRemnantRandom
I hope you know what you're doing!
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogBombPlacedRemnantRandom.ogg]]

#### RogBombPlacedRemnant3
Seems risky!
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogBombPlacedRemnant3.ogg]]

#### RogBombPlacedRemnant5
You sure about that placement?
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogBombPlacedRemnant5.ogg]]

#### RogBombPlacedRemnant6
Are you sure about that placement?
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogBombPlacedRemnant6.ogg]]

#### RogBombPlacedTreasureRandom
I wonder what you'll unearth...
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogBombPlacedTreasureRandom.ogg]]

#### RogBombPlacedTreasure3
Yes, go after the treasure!
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogBombPlacedTreasure3.ogg]]

#### RogBombPlacedTreasure5
Hope you unearth some ancient figurines!
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogBombPlacedTreasure5.ogg]]

#### RogBombPlacedTreasure6
Hope you unearth some ancient figurines.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogBombPlacedTreasure6.ogg]]

#### RogAllBombsPlacedRandom
Ready?
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogAllBombsPlacedRandom.ogg]]

#### RogAllBombsPlaced3
That's all of them.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogAllBombsPlaced3.ogg]]

#### RogAllBombsPlaced5
Detonation time?
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogAllBombsPlaced5.ogg]]

#### RogCombatLineRandom
No!
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogCombatLineRandom.ogg]]

#### RogCombatLine3
Stay away!
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogCombatLine3.ogg]]

#### RogCombatLine5
Help me!
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogCombatLine5.ogg]]

#### RogCombatLine7
RogCombatLine7
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogCombatLine7.ogg]]

#### RogCombatLine8
RogCombatLine8
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogCombatLine8.ogg]]

#### RogCombatLine9
Don't touch me!
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogCombatLine9.ogg]]

#### RogPartingShout
You might run into Dannig next. I'll let him know about you.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogPartingShout.ogg]]

#### RogGossipTujen
He's as loyal a friend as you'll ever find. He would never admit this, but all his scars and injuries are the result of diving in to take a blow for one of us. By all rights, Gwennen should be half-mauled, and I should be missing a leg... but Tujen leapt between. I only feel safe enough to do my job because he's around.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogGossipTujen.ogg]]

#### RogGossipGwennen
She'll never lie to you, Exile. Take that as you will.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogGossipGwennen.ogg]]

#### RogGossipDannig
Our charismatic leader is a man worthy of his position. He takes the front, the lead. I prefer to support things from a safe distance, and he, great man that he is, lets me do it. I've been on my fair share of quests and campaigns, and they keep trying to arm me and train me for fighting, telling me it was the only way I would find renown... but I aim to be the world's first famous supplymaster. That Rog, they'll say, he brought food and drink and equipment forth so promptly and so consistently, it amazed the warriors on both sides and helped win the day. Dannig tells me that this is a worthy dream to pursue. He's a good friend.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogGossipDannig.ogg]]

#### RogGossipTheKing
Oh... I... please don't ask me about him. He is King of the Kalguur, and there are honours and levels of respect that he is due... should we speak of him. If we disrespect him... {he'll know.}
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogGossipTheKing.ogg]]

#### RogGossipTheOrderOfTheChalice
I am bound by honour to discover the fate of Uhtred and the Order of the Chalice. I'll trade you for any relics that you find with their marks and runes. They were the primary priesthood and religious order that went with the initial ships to Wraeclast. They interpreted the stars and the workings of mysterious forces, such as alchemy, machinery, and runes. I've always wanted to join the Order. I quite like the idea of spending my days sequestered in a laboratory doing research.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogGossipTheOrderOfTheChalice.ogg]]

#### RogGossipUhtred
Thousands of years ago, the last news coming back to the homeland painted Uhtred in quite the negative light. Some called him a traitor, but the details were sparse and confused. I'm here to clear his name... or condemn him. The truth stands above all.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogGossipUhtred.ogg]]

#### RogGossipUhtredAndStory
It certainly sounds like Uhtred was indeed a traitor, but I feel like the story is not yet complete. Before I send word of this back home, would you find out the rest, Exile? It's... a matter of importance to me.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogGossipUhtredAndStory.ogg]]

#### RogGossipUhtredDefeatedStoryIncomplete
Uhtred has finally been put to rest? I understand. If nothing else, we've ended the suffering of one of our ancient heroes. I am descended from Owen, the son Uhtred sent back for safety, so it lifts my heart to know one of my ancestors is not out in the darkness continuing to suffer.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogGossipUhtredDefeatedStoryIncomplete.ogg]]

#### RogGossipUhtredDefeatedStoryComplete
If Uhtred did not have the Triskelion Flame, then he was not a traitor. He performed many questionable acts, sure, but from what I can tell, they were done for the right reasons. I will send what you have gathered back to the homeland to ensure his name is honoured, not scorned. Thank you, friend. You've illuminated a piece of our history... my history, in fact. I am descended from Owen, the son Uhtred sent back for safety. You've washed clean a black mark on our lineage. This may change the balance of power back home...
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogGossipUhtredDefeatedStoryComplete.ogg]]

#### RogGossipOlrothAndUhtredDefeatedStoryComplete
Dannig told us that you encountered Olroth and defeated him together! A battle for the ages, no doubt! However, I remain confused. If Uhtred didn't have the Triskelion Flame, then Olroth must have been the one to steal it. Dannig insists the Flame was not with Olroth, so... who took it? Who burned the boats and sailed away on that final fateful day? Something's off. I don't like this feeling, Exile. It leaves me with the ominous sense that there was someone or {something} moving through these events without leaving a trail... it reminds me that we have but small scraps of the true picture, and that our history is only what we tell each other it is. We have not unearthed {the} truth, merely {a} truth, and I am left shaken and isolated from my forebears. All we can do is carry on, my friend.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogGossipOlrothAndUhtredDefeatedStoryComplete.ogg]]

#### RogReopenDealRandom
Our deal remains an option.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogReopenDealRandom.ogg]]

#### RogEncounterCompleteRandom
Stay safe!
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogEncounterCompleteRandom.ogg]]

#### KingsmarchRogIntroduction
Oh, it's you! Welcome to my shop, Rog's Rare Reagents. Let me know if you have any questions.
![[Rog, the Dealer - KingsmarchRogIntroduction.ogg]]

#### KingsmarchRogOnKingsmarch
Oh, Kingsmarch? It's what we Kalguurans call this little port town of ours, and also the region around it. This has all been authorised by the king... and we certainly pay enough taxes that we can never forget that...
![[Rog, the Dealer - KingsmarchRogOnKingsmarch.ogg]]

#### KingsmarchRogOnTheKing
There is no greater a concentration of loyal and dedicated followers of the King than here in this fair port town... {friend.}
![[Rog, the Dealer - KingsmarchRogOnTheKing.ogg]]

#### KingsmarchRogOnKalguurans
What to say about my people? Many of us here on Wraeclast are in various guilds. I'm in the Meridian Free Traders, that's the trade guild that owns the charter for Kingsmarch. You can't beat our logistics! Dannig is in the Artificers' Guild these days. Tujen's a freelance harbourmaster, but he stays close. You gotta keep the family together, you know?
![[Rog, the Dealer - KingsmarchRogOnKalguurans.ogg]]

#### KingsmarchRogOnShop
This shop is my pride and joy. I been dreaming of running my own place since my younger days, even though that was impossible back home. I always knew I'd have to leave. I was never one for grand quests, even though it was one of those that brought me to this land. Always preferred sorting logistics from the back. The wife says I'm the real hero, because I actually have a job and support my family. She might just be buttering me up, but I still take it to heart.
![[Rog, the Dealer - KingsmarchRogOnShop.ogg]]

#### KingsmarchRogOnGrandQuest
The grand quest that brought me here? Oh, no, that's a long story. I couldn't possibly.
![[Rog, the Dealer - KingsmarchRogOnGrandQuest.ogg]]

#### KingsmarchRogOnGrandQuestAgain
Alright then, if you insist, I'll tell the tale! Two decades ago, our glorious leader, Dannig, led us on an expedition across the stormy and dangerous oceans to look for an artefact called the Triskelion Flame. Our search took us to the forsaken continent of Wraeclast, a land filled with horrible monsters and raving mad exiles! But we excavated many ancient sites, uncovering some of the lost history of our people's short residence here. Long ago, Kalguurans tried to settle on Wraeclast, and, well... it didn't go well. In the end, they did not survive, and they lost the Triskelion Flame. We've been looking for it for over twenty years now, and, to be honest, we've gotten a bit sidetracked, but my wife refuses to give up on the dream.
![[Rog, the Dealer - KingsmarchRogOnGrandQuestAgain.ogg]]

#### KingsmarchRogOnWife
You'll run into her out there on the islands, I'm sure. She intends to excavate them all, one by one. At this point, I think she just enjoys digging up ancient relics. She gets excited for every single one, because there's always a chance, however small, that it'll all finally pay off. Me? I'm happy to stay here and watch the children. She's never gone too long.
![[Rog, the Dealer - KingsmarchRogOnWife.ogg]]

#### KingsmarchRogOnPreacher
Business has been up ever since he took up residence outside my shop. People duck in here to seek refuge from him, and I make a sale while they hide. It's a win for everybody!
![[Rog, the Dealer - KingsmarchRogOnPreacher.ogg]]

#### KingsmarchRogJustShip
I can sell this haul for you. Should be more than enough to hire a ship. The only captain available is new to the job, but I know her. Her name's Makoru. She'll get you where you need to go.
![[Rog, the Dealer - KingsmarchRogJustShip.ogg]]

#### KingsmarchRogGenericMedicine
That is quite rare! I always like to find a use for... organic remains. I'll have to experiment on a few pieces of equipment to see what effect it might have. Take this for your troubles.
![[Rog, the Dealer - KingsmarchRogGenericMedicine.ogg]]

#### KingsmarchRogGenericTrophy
I don't even want to ask what manner of beast you slew to get that. If you're willing, I might be interested in buying that from you, so long as you don't tell anyone about your battle. If I had that trophy, then maybe it wasn't {you} that won a legendary battle. Maybe it was {me}. That'll impress the wife!
![[Rog, the Dealer - KingsmarchRogGenericTrophy.ogg]]

#### KingsmarchRogEyeballs
These... oh... these are {eyeballs}. I should have eaten less for lunch. Ooh! There's a power about these squishy red orbs. I can feel it. I wonder what effect squeezing their contents onto a piece of equipment would have? I'd like to find out. Here, take this as fair trade.
![[Rog, the Dealer - KingsmarchRogEyeballs.ogg]]

#### KingsmarchRogTongue
Ah, I recognise that scent. Tongue of a sea serpent! It's a mighty fine delicacy, and a decent medicine besides. This one is unusually large... where did you get this? Wait, no, don't tell me. I'll buy it from you no questions asked. Fair trade.
![[Rog, the Dealer - KingsmarchRogTongue.ogg]]

#### KingsmarchRogSerpentHead
You've got the head of a sea serpent, have you? I'll buy that from you, fair trade, but I'm not entirely sure what I'm going to do with it. I'll be taking a loss on this one, but you've done right by us, so I don't mind. Wait... this is enormous! Where did you get this from? Wait, no, don't tell me. It's better that way.
![[Rog, the Dealer - KingsmarchRogSerpentHead.ogg]]

#### KingsmarchRogLiver
This liver... it keeps healing when I test it with a knife. I simply must buy this wonder from you. It could be a perpetual source of medicinal compounds. Fair trade, as always.
![[Rog, the Dealer - KingsmarchRogLiver.ogg]]

#### KingsmarchRogSirenHead
There was a medusa siren in this region? And you cut her head off? I should probably buy her head from you before somebody accidentally gets turned into stone. Fair trade.
![[Rog, the Dealer - KingsmarchRogSirenHead.ogg]]

#### KingsmarchRogSirenCords
The vocal cords of a siren! These are a rare and powerful organ that I've seen used to forge incredible armour. Dannig could put this to use but it'll take a few years to cure them properly... I'll get back to you. In the meantime, here's something for your trouble.
![[Rog, the Dealer - KingsmarchRogSirenCords.ogg]]

#### KingsmarchRogLipRing
Is this the lip ornament of the sulphite tyrant? Why've you brought it here?! Ugh, it smells... I suppose I should buy it from you, since I'm never one to pass up a profit opportunity, and I know certain Karui who hated this man with a passion... fair trade...
![[Rog, the Dealer - KingsmarchRogLipRing.ogg]]

#### KingsmarchRogLipRingDiskThing
Hmm.. I should call this the Kin King's Lip-Ring Disk Thing... heh heh heh...
![[Rog, the Dealer - KingsmarchRogLipRingDiskThing.ogg]]

#### KingsmarchRogScourgeOfTheSkiesTalon
I know more than a few Karui who would pay a hefty fee for proof that avian monstrosity is dead. It'll be a bit safer for them to poach Shrike eggs now. I'd be happy to act as arbitrage and buy that off of you. Here, fair trade.
![[Rog, the Dealer - KingsmarchRogScourgeOfTheSkiesTalon.ogg]]

#### KingsmarchRogPlayerEntersStoreFirst
This is my shop. Rog's Rarities. Please, look around. And if you have any questions, do let me know.
![[Rog, the Dealer - KingsmarchRogPlayerEntersStoreFirst.ogg]]

#### KingsmarchRogPlayerEntersStoreRandom
Welcome!
![[Rog, the Dealer - KingsmarchRogPlayerEntersStoreRandom.ogg]]

#### KingsmarchRogPlayerEntersStore5
What can I do for you?
![[Rog, the Dealer - KingsmarchRogPlayerEntersStore5.ogg]]

#### KingsmarchRogPlayerLeavesStoreRandom
Do come again!
![[Rog, the Dealer - KingsmarchRogPlayerLeavesStoreRandom.ogg]]

#### KingsmarchRogPlayerLeavesStore5
Come back anytime.
![[Rog, the Dealer - KingsmarchRogPlayerLeavesStore5.ogg]]

#### KingsmarchRogPlayerLeavesStore9
Have a good day!
![[Rog, the Dealer - KingsmarchRogPlayerLeavesStore9.ogg]]

#### KingsmarchRogPlayerLeavesStore13
Come back soon!
![[Rog, the Dealer - KingsmarchRogPlayerLeavesStore13.ogg]]

#### KingsmarchRogPlayerLeavesStore17
Until next time!
![[Rog, the Dealer - KingsmarchRogPlayerLeavesStore17.ogg]]

#### KingsmarchRogPlayerLeavesStore20
Bye, then!
![[Rog, the Dealer - KingsmarchRogPlayerLeavesStore20.ogg]]

#### KingsmarchRogPlayerIdleStoreRandom
Take your time!
![[Rog, the Dealer - KingsmarchRogPlayerIdleStoreRandom.ogg]]

#### KingsmarchRogPlayerIdleStore4
Anything catch your eye?
![[Rog, the Dealer - KingsmarchRogPlayerIdleStore4.ogg]]

#### KingsmarchRogPlayerIdleStore7
Can't find something? I can order most things in you know.
![[Rog, the Dealer - KingsmarchRogPlayerIdleStore7.ogg]]

#### KingsmarchRogPlayerIdleStore10
Fancy a different colour? I can make it happen.
![[Rog, the Dealer - KingsmarchRogPlayerIdleStore10.ogg]]

#### KingsmarchRogPlayerIdleStore13
Might break for lunch soon.
![[Rog, the Dealer - KingsmarchRogPlayerIdleStore13.ogg]]

#### KingsmarchRogPlayerIdleStore16
You've been here a while, friend.
![[Rog, the Dealer - KingsmarchRogPlayerIdleStore16.ogg]]

#### KingsmarchRogPlayerIdleStore19
We do close eventually, you know.
![[Rog, the Dealer - KingsmarchRogPlayerIdleStore19.ogg]]

#### RogCraft_AddModMakeRare_Random
Why don't I throw a Regal Orb on this?
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogCraft_AddModMakeRare_Random.ogg]]

#### RogCraft_AddModMakeRare_4
This piece could be much more useful.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogCraft_AddModMakeRare_4.ogg]]

#### RogCraft_AddModMakeRare_7
There's potential in this one!
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogCraft_AddModMakeRare_7.ogg]]

#### RogCraft_AddPrefix_4
With the right incentive, I could do some extra work on this.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogCraft_AddPrefix_4.ogg]]

#### RogCraft_AddPrefix_7
This can retain another attribute, if you like.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogCraft_AddPrefix_7.ogg]]

#### RogCraft_AddSuffix_4
Oops! There's some bits that fell off, want me to put them back on?
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogCraft_AddSuffix_4.ogg]]

#### RogCraft_AddSuffix_7
This piece could hold another attribute, if you like.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogCraft_AddSuffix_7.ogg]]

#### RogCraft_FillEmptyMods_Random
I like you. That's why I'm going to offer you a premium deal, only for my favourite customers. Just don't ask how I do it!
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogCraft_FillEmptyMods_Random.ogg]]

#### RogCraft_FillEmptyMods_4
I've got a special service available at the moment... for the right price.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogCraft_FillEmptyMods_4.ogg]]

#### RogCraft_FillEmptyMods_7
This piece is eminently improvable!
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogCraft_FillEmptyMods_7.ogg]]

#### RogCraft_Generic_Random
I could give this one a few more taps.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogCraft_Generic_Random.ogg]]

#### RogCraft_Generic_4
How about I hammer out some of those little dents?
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogCraft_Generic_4.ogg]]

#### RogCraft_OpenShop_Random
Care to take a look?
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogCraft_OpenShop_Random.ogg]]

#### RogCraft_OpenShop_4
Let's see what trash we can turn into treasure.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogCraft_OpenShop_4.ogg]]

#### RogCraft_OpenShop_7
Are you ready for some crafting?
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogCraft_OpenShop_7.ogg]]

#### RogCraft_OpenShop_10
What's in stock today, you ask? Well, take a look!
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogCraft_OpenShop_10.ogg]]

#### RogCraft_OpenShop_13
Here's a sample of what we got to work with.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogCraft_OpenShop_13.ogg]]

#### RogCraft_RemoveLowestMod_4
I could etch away the part we don't want.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogCraft_RemoveLowestMod_4.ogg]]

#### RogCraft_RemoveLowestMod_7
There's a bit of a straggler on this one, eh?
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogCraft_RemoveLowestMod_7.ogg]]

#### RogCraft_RemovePrefixes_Random
How about we scrap the front of this and start over?
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogCraft_RemovePrefixes_Random.ogg]]

#### RogCraft_RemovePrefixes_4
I think we can do better if we start fresh on the front.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogCraft_RemovePrefixes_4.ogg]]

#### RogCraft_RemovePrefixes_7
Let's cut this in half, so to speak.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogCraft_RemovePrefixes_7.ogg]]

#### RogCraft_RemoveSuffixes_Random
We could scrap the back end and start over.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogCraft_RemoveSuffixes_Random.ogg]]

#### RogCraft_RemoveSuffixes_4
Let's start fresh on the back half of this.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogCraft_RemoveSuffixes_4.ogg]]

#### RogCraft_RemoveSuffixes_7
We could scrub out some of the attributes on this.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogCraft_RemoveSuffixes_7.ogg]]

#### RogCraft_RerollModValuePrefix_Random
There's a bit of instability in this piece that we could take advantage of.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogCraft_RerollModValuePrefix_Random.ogg]]

#### RogCraft_RerollModValuePrefix_4
If I crush up a dried Thornwolf heart, the powder will have some interesting effects.
![[Rog, the Dealer - RogCraft_RerollModValuePrefix_4.ogg]]
