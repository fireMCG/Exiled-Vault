#### TwilightOrderPreacherInterrupt
Friend, I have urgent news for you. Time is short, and the unmaking of the world is nigh. Please listen to what I have to say.
![[Missionary Lorandis - TwilightOrderPreacherInterrupt.ogg]]

#### TwilightOrderPreacherOnTwilightOrder
We are an order of true believers dedicated to the salvation of humanity. To that end, we have given everything, and will continue to give of ourselves until Wraeclast is saved. Surely, we are on the same side! Surely, you will pledge yourself to aid in the cause!
![[Missionary Lorandis - TwilightOrderPreacherOnTwilightOrder.ogg]]

#### Urgent News
The end of days approaches. Something evil has awoken on Wraeclast. You have faced it, have you not? I can see it in your eyes. You have faced the wickedness in the hearts of men. They seek to conquer us, to rule us. They seek immortality at our expense. We must act! We must fight back!
![[Missionary Lorandis - Urgent News.ogg]]

#### TwilightOrderPreacherFightBack
Yes, we must fight back, together! Do you hear that, Kalguurans? Here is one who will join us in the fight! We will save this world. Utopia is a dream, but Wraeclast is a nightmare. Let us choose which we live in, yes?
![[Missionary Lorandis - TwilightOrderPreacherFightBack.ogg]]

#### TwilightOrderPreacherFightBackIsland
Yes, we must fight back, together! We will save this world. Utopia is a dream, but Wraeclast is a nightmare. Let us choose which we live in, yes?
![[Missionary Lorandis - TwilightOrderPreacherFightBackIsland.ogg]]

#### TwilightOrderUtopia
We work toward utopia, even knowing it can never be real until the iniquities and inadequacies of life are defeated. Utopia is not possible while the wickedness in the hearts of men can be rewarded with immortality. Our Saviour will bring about that utopia, and in it, you shall be free. There will be none to rule you, none to tell you how to live. The struggle for freedom from tyranny will finally be over!
![[Missionary Lorandis - TwilightOrderUtopia.ogg]]

#### TwilightOrderLiberator
Our Saviour is not a god, not divine. Merely mortal, but alone among all humanity, the Saviour is being raised free from Corruption. If you wish to know more, you should visit our enclave. It is not too far from here! Already, the Karui are flocking to our island, eager to join the cause and save Wraeclast! Will you pledge yourself to the Twilight Order as well?
![[Missionary Lorandis - TwilightOrderLiberator.ogg]]

#### TwilightOrderPledge
Come to our island. Visit our enclave. There, you can take the pledge, and we can properly induct you. It may just be the most important thing you ever do!
![[Missionary Lorandis - TwilightOrderPledge.ogg]]

#### TwilightOrderKalguurans
We do not despise the Kalguurans. We merely consider them lucky fools. In their faraway land, they have no Corruption or Divinity, so they do not take our struggle here seriously.
![[Missionary Lorandis - TwilightOrderKalguurans.ogg]]

#### TwilightOrderInteractSinA
Foul creature! I have never seen one so obviously guilty of sin!
![[Missionary Lorandis - TwilightOrderInteractSinA.ogg]]

#### TwilightOrderInteractSinB
What manner of being are you, foul creature?
![[Missionary Lorandis - TwilightOrderInteractSinB.ogg]]

#### TwilightOrderInteractDoryani1
That one reeks of Corruption!
![[Missionary Lorandis - TwilightOrderInteractDoryani1.ogg]]

#### TwilightOrderInteractTujenA1
Peg-leg! Have you contemplated salvation?
![[Missionary Lorandis - TwilightOrderInteractTujenA1.ogg]]

#### TwilightOrderInteractTujenB1
Hook-hand! Will you join us in the fight?
![[Missionary Lorandis - TwilightOrderInteractTujenB1.ogg]]

#### TwilightOrderShout1
The unmaking of the world is nigh! We must act!
![[Missionary Lorandis - TwilightOrderShout1.ogg]]

#### TwilightOrderShout4
We must unite to seek salvation!
![[Missionary Lorandis - TwilightOrderShout4.ogg]]

#### TwilightOrderShout7
Our Saviour will come, and we shall be freed!
![[Missionary Lorandis - TwilightOrderShout7.ogg]]

#### TwilightOrderShout10
Utopia is not a dream! It will be made real!
![[Missionary Lorandis - TwilightOrderShout10.ogg]]

#### TwilightOrderShout13
Free yourselves from tyranny!
![[Missionary Lorandis - TwilightOrderShout13.ogg]]

![[Missionary Lorandis - TwilightOrderClassCommentMarauder.ogg]]

#### TwilightOrderClassCommentWarrior
A Warrior, on the campaign trail!
![[Missionary Lorandis - TwilightOrderClassCommentWarrior.ogg]]

#### TwilightOrderClassCommentDuelist
A Duelist, in the flesh!
![[Missionary Lorandis - TwilightOrderClassCommentDuelist.ogg]]

#### TwilightOrderClassCommentMercenary
A Mercenary, a long way from home!
![[Missionary Lorandis - TwilightOrderClassCommentMercenary.ogg]]

#### TwilightOrderClassCommentRanger
A Ranger, in the city?
![[Missionary Lorandis - TwilightOrderClassCommentRanger.ogg]]

#### TwilightOrderClassCommentHuntress
A Huntress, of the humble Azmeri?
![[Missionary Lorandis - TwilightOrderClassCommentHuntress.ogg]]

![[Missionary Lorandis - TwilightOrderClassCommentShadow.ogg]]

#### TwilightOrderClassCommentMonk
A Monk, from the distant Ogham!
![[Missionary Lorandis - TwilightOrderClassCommentMonk.ogg]]

#### TwilightOrderWelcomeMet
Welcome, friend! I'm glad you've decided to come learn more about our Order. Together, we might just save this world!
![[Missionary Lorandis - TwilightOrderWelcomeMet.ogg]]

#### TwilightOrderWelcomeNotMet
Welcome, friend! This is the humble enclave of the Twilight Order. Are you here because you heard our important message?
![[Missionary Lorandis - TwilightOrderWelcomeNotMet.ogg]]

#### TwilightOrderOnThisIsland
Ah, our beautiful little island! We came here and built this enclave so that we might better reach the Karui with our message. They are a strong people, a warrior culture, and have always rejected Corruption. Now we must teach them that they must reject Divinity as well. Many have already begun to question after the death of their god, Tukohama. The rest is up to us!
![[Missionary Lorandis - TwilightOrderOnThisIsland.ogg]]

#### TwilightOrderOnTukohama
Yes, yes, twenty years ago, that mysterious Godslayer rampaged across Wraeclast and showed the world that it could be done! Tukohama died at the hands of a mortal! The gods can be defeated! Humanity does not have to suffer under the Yoke of Ambition!
![[Missionary Lorandis - TwilightOrderOnTukohama.ogg]]

#### TwilightOrderOnYokeOfAmbition
You really must return later for one of my sermons. I'll explain it all in detail! But to put it short, mankind can never truly be free so long as ambition can lead to godhood. Every warlord, every king, every Sekhema will eventually fall to temptation. The very existence of our faith in them corrupts them, changes them. It is a burden that makes civilisation impossible!
![[Missionary Lorandis - TwilightOrderOnYokeOfAmbition.ogg]]

#### TwilightOrderOnCivilisation
That's what our Saviour will seek to bring, my friend. Peace. Prosperity. Utopia will be simple, once we no longer have to suffer the constant problems of Corruption and Divinity. It is a wondrous dream, is it not?
![[Missionary Lorandis - TwilightOrderOnCivilisation.ogg]]

#### TwilightOrderOnTheSpear
You're looking for ancient ruins? On our little island? I suppose I've seen some old weathered stones here and there. Now that I think about it, I'm certain I've seen a graven image of that spear of yours. Do you mind waiting here while I ask the bishop? He would know better than I.
![[Missionary Lorandis - TwilightOrderOnTheSpear.ogg]]

#### TwilightOrderReassures
Wait here. I'll be right back.
![[Missionary Lorandis - TwilightOrderReassures.ogg]]

#### Preacher_Wild_TPConvo1_A
Good day to you, peg-leg!
![[Missionary Lorandis - Preacher_Wild_TPConvo1_A.ogg]]

#### Preacher_Wild_TPConvo1_C
Is something the matter?
![[Missionary Lorandis - Preacher_Wild_TPConvo1_C.ogg]]

#### Preacher_Wild_TPConvo1_E
Oh! meant no offense.
![[Missionary Lorandis - Preacher_Wild_TPConvo1_E.ogg]]

#### Preacher_Wild_TPConvo2_A
Peg-leg! You must visit us again on Arastas.
![[Missionary Lorandis - Preacher_Wild_TPConvo2_A.ogg]]

#### Preacher_Wild_TPConvo2_C
We have some of the best mead you'll ever taste.
![[Missionary Lorandis - Preacher_Wild_TPConvo2_C.ogg]]

#### Preacher_Wild_TPConvo2_E
Bees are useful for many reasons!
![[Missionary Lorandis - Preacher_Wild_TPConvo2_E.ogg]]

#### Preacher_Wild_TPConvo2_F
But yes, we have some of the best mead the world has ever seen!
![[Missionary Lorandis - Preacher_Wild_TPConvo2_F.ogg]]

#### Preacher_Wild_TPConvo3_B
Why does it bother you so, friend?
![[Missionary Lorandis - Preacher_Wild_TPConvo3_B.ogg]]

#### Preacher_Wild_TPConvo3_D
On the contrary. We've had plenty of pledgers arrive from Kingsmarch.
![[Missionary Lorandis - Preacher_Wild_TPConvo3_D.ogg]]

#### Preacher_Wild_TPConvo4_A
You know, there is a brighter future for you, peg-leg.
![[Missionary Lorandis - Preacher_Wild_TPConvo4_A.ogg]]

#### Preacher_Wild_TPConvo4_B
You just have to reach out and take it!
![[Missionary Lorandis - Preacher_Wild_TPConvo4_B.ogg]]

#### Preacher_Wild_TPConvo4_E
Now, now... violence is not necessary.
![[Missionary Lorandis - Preacher_Wild_TPConvo4_E.ogg]]

#### Preacher_Wild_TPConvo4_F
There'll be no need for that in Utopia!
![[Missionary Lorandis - Preacher_Wild_TPConvo4_F.ogg]]

#### Lorandis_Wild_Church_One
Your timing is quite remarkable, you know!
![[Missionary Lorandis - Lorandis_Wild_Church_One.ogg]]

#### Lorandis_Wild_Church_Two
Together, we can witness the birth of a new tomorrow. A better tomorrow.
![[Missionary Lorandis - Lorandis_Wild_Church_Two.ogg]]

#### Lorandis_Wild_Church_Three
Now, I must ask that you wait here a time. I shall fetch the First Herald! He will know how to aid you.
![[Missionary Lorandis - Lorandis_Wild_Church_Three.ogg]]

#### Lorandis_Wild_Church_Four
I am sure he will be delighted to meet you.
![[Missionary Lorandis - Lorandis_Wild_Church_Four.ogg]]

#### Lorandis_Wild_AmbushSpeech_Random
Friend! Give us the pieces. Come now... think this through. We promise you more! Accept Utopia! Embrace the saviour! Pledge now. It is not too late for you. Beauty awaits us all. Search your heart. You know that there is hope for you. You will not be harmed!
![[Missionary Lorandis - Lorandis_Wild_AmbushSpeech_Random.ogg]]

#### Lorandis_Wild_AmbushDefeated
What!? No! Stay back! Saviour... help me!
![[Missionary Lorandis - Lorandis_Wild_AmbushDefeated.ogg]]

#### Lorandis_Wild_PlayerDeath_Random
You should have pledged, friend.
![[Missionary Lorandis - Lorandis_Wild_PlayerDeath_Random.ogg]]
