## Dannig, Warrior Skald
#### DannigOnExpeditionMap
Our expeditions are a private matter of honour. Let's discuss this in your hideout instead.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigOnExpeditionMap.ogg]]

#### DannigLogbookVaalPlusBlackScythe
The translation's tough on this one. The expedition's Remembrancer was clearly a novice. Prosaic lists of landmarks passed on the trek... notable hills, rivers, a mountain range... he goes on at great length about the battles, though. Pages and pages of arbalest bolts 'finding purchase in the necks and hearts of exotically dressed shamblers.' Young men were still the same bloodthirsty whelps thousands of years ago, it seems. Might be a Vaal site from that description, though he doesn't go into detail about their clothing. The use of arbalests hints at Black Scythe work. There are a few locations that might fit the details from this logbook. What do you think?
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigLogbookVaalPlusBlackScythe.ogg]]

#### DannigIntroGeneralTemplar
You're naught but skin and bones, Exile, but you've made it this far. Clearly, you must have some talent. Care to lend your skills to a matter of honour?
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigIntroGeneralTemplar.ogg]]

#### DannigIntroMarauder
Ah, a fellow warrior! You and I must share tales of ancestral bravery around a campfire! But first, I have a request. A matter of honour. I believe it is something you are well-suited for.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigIntroMarauder.ogg]]

#### DannigNotHelping
Time to earn your keep. You handle the fighting.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigNotHelping.ogg]]

#### DannigApproachShoutRandom
Hail!
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigApproachShoutRandom.ogg]]

#### DannigDetonationRandom
Yes!
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigDetonationRandom.ogg]]

#### DannigDetonation4
Beautiful!
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigDetonation4.ogg]]

#### DannigDetonation7
One step closer.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigDetonation7.ogg]]

#### DannigBombPlacementRiskRandom
Taking on some serious danger I see...
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigBombPlacementRiskRandom.ogg]]

#### DannigBombPlacementRisk4
Are you sure about that one? Seems risky.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigBombPlacementRisk4.ogg]]

#### DannigBombPlacementTreasureRandom
That one'll bring up some worthy baubles.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigBombPlacementTreasureRandom.ogg]]

#### DannigBombPlacementTreasure4
Ah, it's treasure you're after!
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigBombPlacementTreasure4.ogg]]

#### DannigBombPlacementDangerRandom
That'll bring a fight, certainly...
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigBombPlacementDangerRandom.ogg]]

#### DannigBombPlacementDanger4
Quite a few dormant dangers there...
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigBombPlacementDanger4.ogg]]

#### DannigAllBombsPlacedRandom
Ready?
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigAllBombsPlacedRandom.ogg]]

#### DannigAllBombsPlaced4
That's it then.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigAllBombsPlaced4.ogg]]

#### DannigAllBombsPlaced7
Ready when you are.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigAllBombsPlaced7.ogg]]

#### DannigDoingDetonationRandom
Detonations incoming!
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigDoingDetonationRandom.ogg]]

#### DannigOrdersSquireDetonateRandom
Squire! Detonate!
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigOrdersSquireDetonateRandom.ogg]]

#### DannigExplainsExchanging
Some relics are more important than others. If you've found anything from the Knights of the Sun, I'll take those in exchange for what the others trade for.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigExplainsExchanging.ogg]]

#### DannigExplainsExchangingAlternate
My quest is to investigate the Knights of the Sun and acquire their relics. I'm willing to trade other less important relics for theirs.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigExplainsExchangingAlternate.ogg]]

#### DanningRerollInventoryRandom
Let's see what else I've got...
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DanningRerollInventoryRandom.ogg]]

#### DanningRerollInventory4
I can scrounge up a few more options.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DanningRerollInventory4.ogg]]

#### DanningRerollInventory7
Interested in something else, are you?
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DanningRerollInventory7.ogg]]

#### DannigOlrothFightTombOpened
The Triskelion Flame lies beneath! I can feel its power!
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigOlrothFightTombOpened.ogg]]

#### DannigOlrothFightFlameSeen
That's it! We've finally found it!
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigOlrothFightFlameSeen.ogg]]

#### DannigOlrothAwakens
Exile! He stirs!
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigOlrothAwakens.ogg]]

#### DannigOlrothDefeatedFirst
While he's down, let's take the Flame!
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigOlrothDefeatedFirst.ogg]]

#### DannigOlrothDamageFlameFirst
We cannot defeat him directly. Use explosives to damage the Flame!
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigOlrothDamageFlameFirst.ogg]]

#### DannigOlrothDefeatedSecond
It's still not over!
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigOlrothDefeatedSecond.ogg]]

#### DannigOlrothDefeatedDamageFlameSecond
Use the explosives again! Damage the Triskelion Flame!
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigOlrothDefeatedDamageFlameSecond.ogg]]

#### DannigOlrothFightEnd
The Flame has been destroyed... but at least Olroth can finally rest.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigOlrothFightEnd.ogg]]

#### DannigOlrothFightEpilogueCommentary
Don't tell the others we destroyed the Flame. They'll lose hope. This quest is about the journey, not the destination.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigOlrothFightEpilogueCommentary.ogg]]

#### DanningHowAboutYourHideout
We're looking for a safe and secluded base of operations. If you have a hideout, that would be ideal. We can plan our expeditions from there.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DanningHowAboutYourHideout.ogg]]

#### DannigReinvitedToHideout
You're quite fickle, but fair enough.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigReinvitedToHideout.ogg]]

#### DannigLogbookKnightsOfTheSun
Remembrancers attached to the Knights of the Sun were often overly poetic. Does anyone actually know what a 'dale' is? This one's used it {three times} to describe a valley, a clearing, and a meadow. Be specific, chronicler! I've deciphered all I can from this logbook. This one's up to you, Exile.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigLogbookKnightsOfTheSun.ogg]]

#### DannigLogbookBlackScytheMercenaries
You can always tell a Black Scythe logbook. Full of martial details and exquisite descriptions of violent combat, strategic decisions, and Vorana's murderous grace on the battlefield. Fairly short on useful logistical markers, though. Your guess is as good as mine, Exile.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigLogbookBlackScytheMercenaries.ogg]]

#### DannigLogbookDruidsOfTheBrokenCircle
This is quietly disturbing, but logbooks written by the Druid Remembrancers often describe natural terrain by what it {was}, as well as what it {might one day be}. I find these logbooks the most accurate to the landscape we see today. They couldn't actually see the future by looking into the past, could they? They were simply experts on nature. Yes, science shrouded in mysticism... an excuse that reassures my soul. Shall we test their guesses, Exile?
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigLogbookDruidsOfTheBrokenCircle.ogg]]

#### DannigLogbookOrderOfTheChalice
Uhtred and his priests had their own secret agendas. Hard to decipher overly religious logbook text that might not even be truthful. Not knocking religion, just their bombastic choice of words. Everything's 'pure' and 'starlit' and 'gleaming.' Makes piecing together a trail an exercise in frustration. There's at least one Order of the Chalice site mentioned. What shall we pursue, Exile?
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigLogbookOrderOfTheChalice.ogg]]

#### DannigLogbookMaraketh
I don't know much about the Maraketh, but this logbook's landmarks might have us treading on one of their ancient sites. I think we can get away with it if we're quick. It's up to you, Exile.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigLogbookMaraketh.ogg]]

#### DannigLogbookVaal
I'm not a treasure-seeker by nature, but this one tempts even me. The logbook describes mountains of gold found in Vaal cities filled with colourfully dressed shamblers. Mountains of gold. Mountains... of gold... Do you think they're still there? Let's find out. Unless you want to travel to other less interesting sites for some reason...
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigLogbookVaal.ogg]]

#### DannigLogbookKarui
This expedition might take us through a Karui site. Now those are an honourable people I'd very much like to get to know. I've spent my life in search of renown, so their Way intrigues me. Shall we learn all we can, Exile?
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigLogbookKarui.ogg]]

#### DannigLogbookEternalEmpire
I'm intrigued by this Eternal Empire. I'd call them not quite Eternal since they're all dead now, but since so many of them are still walking around as shamblers, perhaps they were aptly named. Care to explore one of their ancient sites, Exile?
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigLogbookEternalEmpire.ogg]]

#### DannigLogbookOriathan
The Oriathans haven't been very friendly to us. This expedition might take us through one of their sites, and I've half a mind to desecrate a bit extra on purpose. Interested in some destruction, Exile?
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigLogbookOriathan.ogg]]

#### DannigLogbookSiren
The terrain clues from this logbook could potentially take us to a location once inhabited by Sirens. Sounds like a myth to me, but myths usually contain a kernel of truth. Perhaps I'll stuff my ears to avoid their supposedly enchanting songs. We could then investigate and see the truth for ourselves. What do you say, Exile?
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigLogbookSiren.ogg]]

#### DannigLogbookMonkeyTribe
If I'm translating this logbook correctly, they seem to have met a tribe of... monkeys?... that could communicate with hand signs. They were capable of trade, and even had their own statues of deities unknown. I've been continually astounded by Wraeclast's wonders and dangers, but this one still seems a bit unbelievable to me. Shall we investigate this claim, Exile?
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigLogbookMonkeyTribe.ogg]]

#### DannigLogbookLostMen
I'm not sure I understand what I'm translating. At least one of the locations mentioned in this logbook belonged to a tribe of 'men of no name' who worshipped the bones of a specific kind of long-dead beast whose description makes no sense to me. Your continent is strange. Interested in exploring that area, Exile?
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigLogbookLostMen.ogg]]

#### DannigLogbookVaalPlusKnights
It was the Knights of the Sun that first explored the cursed cities of the Vaal. This logbook was from those early days, right after they arrived on Wraeclast and found that empire glorious, shining... and filled with shamblers. I can't imagine what horrific event might have caused the death of an entire civilisation all at once. Not sure I want to know. Shall we follow in their footsteps, Exile?
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigLogbookVaalPlusKnights.ogg]]

#### DannigLogbookVaalPlusOrder
This logbook has some fairly detailed discussion of Uhtred's declaration that virtue gems were unclean and not to be touched. These gems were often seen on or {in} the shambling dead inhabiting the silent Vaal empire, and the connection was clear. Strange that my people learned that lesson so quickly, but you... well, you know gems better than I do. What shall we do, Exile?
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigLogbookVaalPlusOrder.ogg]]

#### DannigLogbookVaalPlusDruids
This logbook... I don't think I can repeat what I've read. The Druids of the Broken Circle claimed to have the ability to look into the past, so of course they tried to understand the fate of the Vaal Empire that lay dead and empty across Wraeclast. This logbook... No. I can face fear. If you give the word, we'll go, Exile.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigLogbookVaalPlusDruids.ogg]]

#### DannigLogbookGeneric
The landmarks described in this logbook don't match anything particularly notable on our current maps. The terrain has changed too much over the centuries. At best, I'm making guesses here. Do you care to pick a destination?
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigLogbookGeneric.ogg]]

#### DannigLogbookOlroth
This is incredible! We may have finally found it! This logbook contains various final notes from a Remembrancer trying to desperately piece together where their greatest leader might have gone. From the text, it seems as if one of these sites might contain the final resting place of Olroth himself! Care to tread into legend with me, Exile?
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigLogbookOlroth.ogg]]

#### DannigLogbookVorana
It seems a novice Remembrancer followed Vorana's path of carnage during her last stand. We could retrace the steps through the terrain he describes, and perhaps find her final resting place. If I'm honest, I'm a little hesitant to do so. She was a fearsome warrior in life, by all accounts. In death, she may be beyond even your talents. The choice is yours, Exile.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigLogbookVorana.ogg]]

#### DannigLogbookMedved
Of the four great heroes, Medved was the most mysterious. His nature-mystics maintained many guarded sanctuaries in the wild. Even if he lost his senses thanks to Wraeclast's darkness, he may still have used those havens for evil ends. This logbook's details could lead us to his suspected location. It's up to you, Exile.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigLogbookMedved.ogg]]

#### DannigLogbookUhtred
In the final days of our people's history here, the Prime Remembrancer fled with the remaining survivors in a desperate bid to escape the coming doom. This is his logbook, Exile! Apparently, the Order of the Chalice found something... some unknown artifact... all he knew was that even the oldest men recognised its power and built a shrine around it. It was to that shrine that Uhtred fled to escape Vorana's wrath. The survivors expected to meet him there, but the writing stops just short of the destination. Shall we retrace their steps?
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigLogbookUhtred.ogg]]

#### DannigGossipOrigin
We are of the Kalguur. Ours is an existence spent scrabbling in the muck and mire of mortal life in search of scraps of renown. Some find it on the battlefield. Some find it in service. Others volunteer to sail to the edge of the known world on an impossible quest. The choices we make determine what we are, and what we become echoes into legend.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigGossipOrigin.ogg]]

#### DannigGossipRunes
The runes on our armour essentially capture and shape starlight. Sounds poetic, but don't be fooled. The smiths of the Kalguur turned these runes towards killing work long ago, as soon as they discovered that they could compel arrows to find their mark and blades to bite deeper. The greatest smiths became known as artificers, and produced work of singular genius. There weren't many such relics, but there didn't need to be.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigGossipRunes.ogg]]

#### DannigGossipTriskelionFlame
The most powerful artifact in our known tales was brought to this continent by the first expedition thousands of years ago. The songs tell of it incinerating evil, purifying tainted fields, and warding off those of ill intent. We could certainly use a relic like that now, in these troubled times... but to find it, we'll have to retrace the steps of those long ago souls. Only they can tell us the Triskelion Flame's unknown fate.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigGossipTriskelionFlame.ogg]]

#### DannigGossipGems
I believe that {you} believe that these coloured gems give you power, Exile. I've handled one of them, even tried to 'activate it' the way that local Tarkleigh described, but it didn't do a damn thing. Call me a skeptic, but to me, it seems like the power was inside you all along.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigGossipGems.ogg]]

#### DannigGossipGods
I've never heard of this 'gods' thing before setting foot here, but I know of at least one... {man}... who would fancy himself a god. Best we not mention Divinity to those back home.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigGossipGods.ogg]]

#### DannigGossipTheKing
I'll not speak on the matter of that... {man}.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigGossipTheKing.ogg]]

#### DannigSagaBeforeArrival
It was impossible to decipher the true meaning of the omen, but none could deny that it had happened. The land shook, the night-clouds fled, the people quavered and hid, startrails arced across the sky to set fire to our forests where they fell, and a crimson sun rose on the horizon. Such was the power of the glow, the half moon became full and ruddy.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigSagaBeforeArrival.ogg]]

#### DannigSagaTheJourneyI
Something wondrous and terrible had happened, so King Cadigan the Third commissioned an expedition toward that horizon, led by our greatest warriors and carrying the Triskelion Flame for protection. Bound to the Flame by duty, I signed on as Prime Remembrancer. We departed within the month.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigSagaTheJourneyI.ogg]]

#### DannigSagaTheJourneyII
The lost journey across unruly and angry seas took nearly two seasons, during which we rarely saw the sky through the clouds of black beset by crimson lightning. We could not drink the rain, nor eat the fish, until the Flame cleansed the water and purified the meat. Even then, the sustenance was hollow. Our supplies were depleted and our men hungry by the time land emerged in the distance.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigSagaTheJourneyII.ogg]]

#### DannigSagaArrivalI
The first foot set upon this land was crushed by unseen jaws beneath the sand. Omens are rarely so clear. We carved a grisly path across the dunes, driving back creatures of the water, only to find ghastly horrors shambling between the trees. Every step came with a cost in blood.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigSagaArrivalI.ogg]]

#### DannigSagaArrivalII
On the seventh night, the grim clouds finally parted for a time, and our blessed stars emerged. Olroth staked the Triskelion Flame in the center of our fortifications. The barrier rites complete, we gained some small measure of safety. From there, everything stemmed, like a bloom under the embrace of a tree.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigSagaArrivalII.ogg]]

#### DannigSagaArrivalIII
As the Knights of the Sun moved further inland, we found the remnants of a tremendous empire to rival that of our homeland. Countless bodies lay charred, but countless others refused to rest. Many were adorned in glittering gems that drew the eye and called to us. Those abominations that still walked often bore the gems within their very limbs. Seeing this, Uhtred declared such crystals unclean. None among us wished to argue.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigSagaArrivalIII.ogg]]

#### DannigSagaArrivalIV
Vast mountains of gold lay throughout the dead empire, often guarded by the most dangerous and most opulently dressed of the undying. Even in their monstrous state, these nobles and priests lurked near the treasures, unwilling to give up that which had meant more to them than their own lives. They had not died in the streets like those attempting to flee. They had locked and barricaded their temples, sealing themselves in their own tombs.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigSagaArrivalIV.ogg]]

#### DannigSagaArrivalV
The nobles of Utzaal had opened their own waterways and purposely drowned themselves, not as a mercy, but to spite would-be looters. This had been an empire ruled by madmen. They were successful in their spite, for we could not drain the deadly waters. Their treasures would remain lost for all time. The other cities, however, proved a slow and steady source of wealth beyond imagination.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigSagaArrivalV.ogg]]

#### DannigSagaColonisationI
King Cadigan the Third considered this new land and its treasures an open bounty. The craftsmen arrived first, soon followed by ships brimming with merchants and freemen. The women and children naturally followed, and, by the third year, the first village charter was established. All was prosperous so long as the Triskelion Flame burned bright, but there were soon too many of us to remain fully within the grace of its protection.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigSagaColonisationI.ogg]]

#### DannigSagaColonisationII
The mercenaries of the Black Scythe, under Vorana, developed strategies for defense and culling that expanded what territory we could protect. Distance was key. Wielding crossbows and remaining behind sturdy walls, her men could savage horrors one at a time, ripping them to shreds until they no longer moved. We had the audacity to believe we could master this forsaken continent through such simple and mundane means. Ten more villages were established that year.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigSagaColonisationII.ogg]]

#### DannigSagaColonisationIII
Trade began with island-men and mountain-men along distant routes, although we shared no language and could not understand one another. I recorded some of the island-men's songs for future deciphering, and I met survivors of the fallen empire among the mountain-men.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigSagaColonisationIII.ogg]]

#### DannigSagaColonisationIV
To the last, the scant survivors of the fallen empire bore none of the gems we had seen on the shambling dead. When I drew the shape of a gem in the dirt, a great panic arose, and we were banished from the mountains. Upon hearing of this, King Cadigan the Third officially banned the crystals, and none were procured nor shipped to the homeland.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigSagaColonisationIV.ogg]]

#### DannigSagaDarknessDescendsI
By the time King Cadigan the Fourth came to power in the homeland, we numbered too many villages to fully count. Dissidents, pariahs, religious factions, and lost-men had all come to build new lives in a new land, and had no wish to report to the Knights. It was these outlying enclaves that suffered the first of the new horrors, often in silence, unwilling to admit to outsiders they were facing dangers they could not defeat on their own.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigSagaDarknessDescendsI.ogg]]

#### DannigSagaDarknessDescendsII
Each man or woman that fell on the fringes became another shambling creature lurking in the night. The curse of the land had not been lifted by the Triskelion Flame, merely held at bay. The deaths of our people strengthened the curse.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigSagaDarknessDescendsII.ogg]]

#### DannigSagaDarknessDescendsIII
Medved's nature-mystics announced that they had found a breath or a vapor that left a man upon his death, visible only when that man died near one of the forbidden gems, and only as the vapor was drawn to it. Medved declared that all men must possess some essence as yet not understood. For this, Uhtred declared him a blasphemer, and was set to banish his order to the fringes. Medved paid a great sum to avert this exile, and the matter was settled.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigSagaDarknessDescendsIII.ogg]]

#### DannigSagaDarknessDescendsIV
In the winter of that year, caravans and runners sent to the fringes no longer returned. Olroth took the Knights of the Sun through the cold forests and hills to seek them. It was found that the men of the fringes had lost a great many of their number, and were beset by horrors never before seen.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigSagaDarknessDescendsIV.ogg]]

#### DannigSagaDarknessDescendsV
Olroth and his Knights evacuated the fringes and set fire to the forests there. From the southern rivers to the northern sands, a vast line of flame burned. None would speak of the reason for this drastic action. Upon his return, Olroth expanded the influence of the Triskelion Flame, although the starlight barrier would be far weaker over such a vast territory. It was necessary to protect the villages. Olroth the Gallant retreated into seclusion often, and became known as Olroth the Grim.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigSagaDarknessDescendsV.ogg]]

#### DannigSagaOlrothsJournalI
What fell spring this is! Upon the dark of the moon, the Empty-Eyed Fiend has taken another of our number. This one was a young woman slated to begin warrior training upon her Second Passage. Many fell to the horrors of this accursed land in the early days, but I believed we had mastered the darkness with our purification rituals. I was mistaken. Growing unpoisoned food is not the same as securing safety from the nightbreeds. It is as if the very land itself is learning from our victories, twisting creatures in new ways that subvert our defences.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigSagaOlrothsJournalI.ogg]]

#### DannigSagaOlrothsJournalII
A new war tactic has been crafted by Medved and his nature-mystics, a strategy formerly forbidden by their beliefs. He observed the capability of the horrors here to rapidly grow and change, and he suggested that our mistake lay in the incompleteness of our task. When we culled all but the hardiest of the twisted Vorniculia, the ones that remained spawned more of their ilk with inherited lethality. To ensure a true victory and protect our burgeoning towns, we must eliminate whole breeds from existence. We must amputate a piece of nature entirely. Anything less only serves to draw ever tighter the vise of doom.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigSagaOlrothsJournalII.ogg]]

#### DannigSagaOlrothsJournalIII
The Vorniculia are slain to the last, and will stain this land with their noxious poisons no more. There are countless other nightbreeds lurking in the shadows of this accursed land, but a small victory is still a victory. The skill of my knights and of Vorana's men was great enough that no lives were lost in the burning of forest and heath. There is no cause for mourning this rare day. My thoughts turn to my unfinished duty. The Empty-Eyed Fiend is the only one of its kind I have seen. I must ensure it, too, vanishes from this world at the behest of torch and blade.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigSagaOlrothsJournalIII.ogg]]

#### DannigSagaOlrothsJournalIV
Half of the Knights of the Sun lie strewn across the hills and trails of the hunt for the Empty-Eyed Fiend. I scored a direct blow with my sword against its neck, but the wound did not bleed. It is not a living thing. It feasts with its countless arm-teeth not to survive by eating, but to enjoy the screams of its victims. I saw this in the twin voids set in its rotting face. It... smiled at me... as it bit my squire in half. Mortal flame found no purchase. Mortal weaponry drew no blood. I am driven to consider the forbidden. Medved and his nature-mystics cast aside their primary virtue to make survival here possible, and now I must do the same. The mountain-men warned us against the gems of power, but now I believe there is no choice...
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigSagaOlrothsJournalIV.ogg]]

#### DannigSagaOlrothsJournalV
Exhilarating! Enthralling! I journeyed into the night alone, a forbidden gem embedded in the pommel of my formerly useless sword. This time, I returned with the head of the Fiend, still grinning in final death, but now conquered. The gem blazed with the light of my fury, casting forth a beam of starlight that turned a missed slice into a cutting lethal blow. We have been fools to deny this power. Too many of our people have suffered for this mistake. When the morning glow hits the treetops, I will command the surviving Knights of the Sun to search for more of the forbidden gems. It is time to conquer this land and make it safe for all time.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigSagaOlrothsJournalV.ogg]]

#### DannigSagaTheBrokenCircleI
The summer that the Knights of the Sun began affixing the forbidden gems to their weapons and armour, Medved of the Druids of the Circle went among the people. "The future-past has become clouded. Scrying pools in this land often remain tainted with crimson fog, but this is something new. The night that Olroth departed alone, I could no longer see the past. Thus, the future is unknown." Thereafter, his order became known as the Druids of the Broken Circle.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigSagaTheBrokenCircleI.ogg]]

#### DannigSagaTheBrokenCircleII
A hooded woman spoke to Medved in the square, under the pike that held the head of the Empty-Eyed Fiend. "Have you lost your faith, then, High Druid?" Medved replied, "A man that does not study the past cannot escape repeating it, but a man that cannot study the past has no future at all. The Circle has been Broken." The woman then lifted her hood and revealed herself as Vorana, leader of the Black Scythe. She replied, "Take up arms, then, and we shall fight our way across the gap between past and future." Medved accepted her gift of two axes, and began training his order for battle. The two axes had gems fixed along the handles which offered tremendous power.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigSagaTheBrokenCircleII.ogg]]

#### DannigSagaTheBrokenCircleIII
The Druids of the Broken Circle and the mercenaries of the Black Scythe marshalled their forces near the fringes, aiding the Knights of the Sun, who had lost half of their number in the hunt for the Empty-Eyed Fiend. The starlight barrier was extended and weak, but the newly empowered warriors used the might of the gems to hold the night-stalking horrors at bay. A stalemate held for a number of seasons, during which many great heroes rose to prominence for their deeds. Annest, daughter of Medved and Vorana, was sent back to the homeland to be raised in safety. Olroth's son, nearing his First Passage, went with her as her guardian.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigSagaTheBrokenCircleIII.ogg]]

#### DannigSagaTheBrokenCircleIV
Dread swept through the ranks when the unthinkable happened: a leader arose among the twisted horrors, capable of intelligent deeds and direction. Creatures began striking where the starlight barrier was weakest, or where the patrols did not cross. Possessed by some horrible notion he would not share, Medved sent a messenger into the dark. The messenger was allowed to return alive with a parchment. The words written on it seemed to confirm Medved's fears, and he traveled into the night to challenge the new leader of the enemy. He did not return.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigSagaTheBrokenCircleIV.ogg]]

#### DannigSagaThePriesthoodI
The priests had eyes and ears everywhere by the season of Medved's disappearance. High Priest Uhtred suspected treachery, and kept initiates silently observing the comings and goings of other leaders. They found that, after each day spent tirelessly fighting to utter exhaustion, Olroth the Grim would return to his seclusion. Then, after some time, he would leave through another door, stealing into the night without being observed. In these excursions, his eyes were closed, as if he were asleep.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigSagaThePriesthoodI.ogg]]

#### DannigSagaThePriesthoodII
Uhtred made many devious plans, during which he sent his son Owen to the homeland to avoid retribution. A week after the harvest, in the cold of evening, a dozen priests awaited Olroth outside his keep. They used daggers of the sacrament to stab Olroth in his sleepwalking state. He was wounded seventy-one times, and fell. Vorana entered like a black wind and removed the heads of the twelve in one stroke.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigSagaThePriesthoodII.ogg]]

#### DannigSagaThePriesthoodIII
Olroth was laid upon a bier and attended with medicines, bandages, and herbs. The people roared for the blood of the priesthood, but Uhtred claimed no knowledge of these twelve traitors. The greatest leader of the people lay at the edge of death. They encased him in glass to keep his breath from escaping.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigSagaThePriesthoodIII.ogg]]

#### DannigSagaThePriesthoodIV
A hooded woman spoke to Uhtred in the square, under the pike that held the head of the Empty-Eyed Fiend. "Why do you suppose your priests assaulted Olroth?" Uhtred replied, "Why do you suppose Olroth was stealing into the darkness? He is the new leader of the twisted horrors. By day, he fights for us, and by night, for them." The woman then lifted her hood and revealed herself as Vorana, leader of the Black Scythe. She replied, "For these words, I should kill you where you stand." A scythe to his throat, Uhtred replied, "Kill me in one week if you wish it. If the enemy becomes disorganized and listless while Olroth lies in glass, then you will know the truth of my words." Vorana promised, "I will feed you to the head of the Empty-Eyed Fiend, here, if you are wrong." Then she departed. The enemy did not become disorganized or listless that week, and Uhtred went into hiding at an ancient site of power.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigSagaThePriesthoodIV.ogg]]

#### DannigSagaTheLastToFallI
The week Vorana made her oath, a new leader among the horrors arose. It wielded two axes, and sought the heroes that had made names for themselves, challenging them to personal combat. It slew forty-two, one each night. When Vorana faced this abomination, she understood it was her beloved Medved, but could not believe it. She ordered a full retreat, and refused to answer the challenge. Two villages were destroyed.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigSagaTheLastToFallI.ogg]]

#### DannigSagaTheLastToFallII
Understanding that Uhtred had been right in speaking ill of great men, she sent a runner to speak with him. A plan was devised to entreat the Triskelion Flame and draw back the starlight barrier. It could safely protect a few villages completely, rather than the entire region weakly. All the surviving people were evacuated to the core lands, and Vorana found the proper rites in Olroth's journal to adjust the Flame. This, she sent to Uhtred by messenger.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigSagaTheLastToFallII.ogg]]

#### DannigSagaTheLastToFallIII
The core villages were crowded to full, and the beleaguered warriors of the Knights of the Sun, the Black Scythe, and the Broken Circle had all drawn back. The starlight barrier did not retreat. Instead, it vanished. In haste, Vorana went to the Triskelion Flame's altar, but found it missing. The ships in the harbour had all been burned and sunk as well, save one, which had departed. To the people, she shouted, "Uhtred the Traitor has taken the Flame!" The people wailed in despair as the horrors closed in from all sides. Without the starlight barrier, there was no protection. The core villages became a fortress tomb, defended by wall and by iron, but inescapable. Many of us retreated to Olroth's resting place, only to find his glass case shattered. He has arisen, and we must believe he is out in the dark fighting to save us, no matter what Uhtred the Traitor claimed.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigSagaTheLastToFallIII.ogg]]

#### DannigSagaTheLastToFallIV
Vorana sent messengers to the island-men and the mountain-men for aid, but their fate was unknown. The defenders were valiant, but new food could not be purified without the Flame. Famine set in, and the seasons refused to slow their passing. Thin and wasting away, Vorana realized that waiting meant death. She knew there was a way to increase her power, so she performed the forbidden rite and placed gems inside her own flesh.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigSagaTheLastToFallIV.ogg]]

#### DannigSagaTheLastToFallV
She arose, then, and went out from the walls, reaping death among the night-horrors with each vast swing of her scythes. They could not stand against her might. She called to us, "I will not rest until every single abomination lies dead!" Some among us believe she can personally slay every monster in this forsaken land herself. Others are not so idealistic. If Vorana should not return, there is still one way out, one we dared not risk before, hidden under the earth and older than the oldest men... We must keep hope alive. This is not the end of our people in this land. Night falls, but there will be a dawn.

#### DannigA4OnKingsmarch
This little jewel on the sea might have been granted an official charter by the King, but it's those of us here on Wraeclast that have built it into the trading hub it is today. Many of us came here to investigate the ancient colonisation of this land, and somehow, we ended up following the footsteps of our intrepid ancestors.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigA4OnKingsmarch.ogg]]

#### DannigA4OnTheKing
The King commissioned this port through a trading company charter after we'd already been operating it as an outpost for many years. We ourselves would like to investigate the remnants of our own culture, he is... {very} interested... in Vaal artefacts instead.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigA4OnTheKing.ogg]]

#### DannigA4OnColonisation
Kingsmarch is actually our second attempt at colonising Wraeclast. Our first expedition, thousands of years back, was mysteriously lost. My colleagues and I came here two decades ago in search of that ancient historical truth, and in search of the artifact of power they brought with them to Wraeclast. It has become my life's work: the search for the Triskelion Flame!
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigA4OnColonisation.ogg]]

#### DannigA4OnTriskelionFlame
The most powerful artifact in our known tales was brought to this continent by the first expedition thousands of years ago. The songs tell of it incinerating evil, purifying tainted fields, and warding off those of ill intent. We could certainly use a relic like that now, in these troubled times... we've been searching for it for nigh on twenty years now, and we're just as motivated as ever. I still intend to get out there and excavate, I just get bogged down by the work of running Kingsmarch.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigA4OnTriskelionFlame.ogg]]

#### DannigA4OnRunes
The runes on our armour essentially capture and shape starlight. Sounds poetic, but don't be fooled. The smiths of the Kalguur turned these runes toward killing work long ago, as soon as we discovered we could compel arrows to find their mark and blades to bite deeper. The greatest smiths became known as artificers, and produced work of singular genius. I'm not quite there yet, but it's only a matter of time and determination.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigA4OnRunes.ogg]]

#### DannigA4OnVirtueGems
We've had twenty years on Wraeclast, and those gems you use continue to perplex me. Clearly, they grant you mystical abilities, but they simply don't do anything in the hands of a Kalguuran. We have our own methods of mystical power, to be fair, but your gems remain an enigma. Somehow, I suspect the power is actually inside {you}, and these 'virtue gems' are just the particular way you believe the world works. I'm no priest, though, so take my opinion for what it's worth.
![[Dannig, Warrior Skald - DannigA4OnVirtueGems.ogg]]

#### DannigA4OnGods
There's something about you natives of Wraeclast. I didn't believe your gods existed until I saw the leader of a murderous cult begin to... {change}. It was about eighteen years ago now, when our expeditions took us into the wrong little enclave. His worshippers' faith had a physical effect on his appearance, and his strength grew even as we fought him, because they were watching and becoming further inspired by his prowess. It was a legendary battle, one with a clever solution: we slew his worshippers instead. That put an end to the problem, at least for the moment. The route to godhood still exists for every little despot {this} side of the ocean. We must all remain vigilant against men of dark ambition.

I wish I could tell you more about our grand quest, hero, but the time isn't right. You could say, we're trying to put right what once went wrong. With the power of refined Verisium, we're rupturing a few holes in Wraeclast's skin, in search of a particular triumph of Kalguuran artifice. We seek... the Triskelion Flame! Oh, you haven't heard of it yet? Yes, of course. We need it for something very important, and time is growing short...

#### Logbooks
To retrace the steps of our forebears, we'll need to find their logbooks. The men and women who recorded our journeys were known as Remembrancers, and they wrote down every detail for posterity. Logbooks were designed to be durable, and to survive through the ages, so you should still be able to find them... wherever they've ended up. Bring them to me, and we'll set up an expedition. Ultimately, we must find the resting place of Olroth, the legendary hero... and with him, hopefully, the Triskelion Flame!

Wraeclast is a torturous mistress... all we can do is press on. Triumph is not found in a single victory, but in the will to keep working on a task that may never end.

#### DannigEndgame_OnTriskelionFlame
Twenty years is a very long time to search for something. I've wanted so badly to find the Flame, and for so long... it's an agonizing feeling, a close kin to madness, to finally find what you seek only to cause its destruction. For years, I lived with that secret, that pain, that I kept from the others. And then... I found Olroth again. The Flame, too. Was the first a fake? My heart soared at the prospect of another chance, only to have my hopes dashed for a second time. Then, a third. And a fourth. Every few years, Wraeclast twists the knife in my gut. Are these memories real? Are they nightmares? This land has become my home, but I'll never feel truly at ease so long as the very earth itself offers up twisted lies... and I can never give up, either, because I still hold on to the maddening hope that the next one might really be it... or the hope that, if I send you instead, things might turn out differently...

It seems that our forebears scouted a few islands before settling on the mainland. The Remembrancer that wrote this logbook is usually one of my favorites, but in this one, he simply drew an X and wrote, "Frogs." That's... strangely ominous. I might chalk this one up to our natural Kalguuran distrust of warmer and wetter climates. Nothing like the crisp acrid air of a volcanic mountainside to wake a man up in the morning!
