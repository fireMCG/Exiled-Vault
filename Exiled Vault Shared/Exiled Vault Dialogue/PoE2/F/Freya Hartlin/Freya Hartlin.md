#### ImposterWomanWildShout
Stop! Don't come near the circle.

#### LilyRothMumAmbientRandom
What are you doing? Help me!
![[Freya Hartlin - LilyRothMumAmbientRandom.ogg]]

#### LilyRothMumAmbient2
Hello? Can you see me?!
![[Freya Hartlin - LilyRothMumAmbient2.ogg]]

#### LilyRothMumAmbient3
Who are you? I'm trapped!
![[Freya Hartlin - LilyRothMumAmbient3.ogg]]

#### LilyRothMumTotemDestruction
That's it! Hurry!
![[Freya Hartlin - LilyRothMumTotemDestruction.ogg]]

#### LilyRothMumTransform
Heh heh... thank you kindly... I am finally free!
![[Freya Hartlin - LilyRothMumTransform.ogg]]

#### ImposterWomanIntroduction
Cadigan preserve me! I thought you were going to blunder in here like I did. I've been stuck in this ancient trap for days, and you're the only {living} person I've seen on this horrible isle of the dead. My son and his crew went to search for some Verisium to crack this mystical prison open, but they haven't come back... please find him! He'll know what to do!
![[Freya Hartlin - ImposterWomanIntroduction.ogg]]

#### ImposterWomanTotems
These totems might {look} like relics of an abandoned Karui settlement, but I can assure you that there is more to them than meets the eye. When I walked in here, they flared brightly with power, and now I can't get out! This is clearly some sort of Karui prison imbued with their ancestral magic. The only thing I can think of that would break this type of trap might be the metal we came here to find in the first place, Verisium.

#### ImposterWomanVerisium
You don't know about Verisium? Oh, dear. It's a metal found in craters when rocks fall from the sky. It's the foundation of all Kalguuran smithing and runework. We call it Verisium, or 'truth metal,' because what is runed becomes reality...
![[Freya Hartlin - ImposterWomanVerisium.ogg]]

#### ImposterWomanRunes
You really don't know about these things? Oh, {dear}. How do I explain this? Hmm... if a smith imprints the rune for 'deadly' on a sword, that sword {becomes} deadlier, in accordance with the smith's own skill. Similarly, my son was hoping to imprint some spikes with the proper runes to break me out of this prison...
![[Freya Hartlin - ImposterWomanRunes.ogg]]

#### ImposterWomanKedgeBay
It was my son's idea, as captain of our family's vessel, to come here. This island is widely considered cursed. The stories say that if the mists open and reveal themselves to you, it is only as a siren song, a vision dancing before the mind. Dozens of ships have broken themselves upon these shoals, and we thought we could slip through the mists and salvage their Verisium cargo for our own. I warned my son, but he didn't listen...
![[Freya Hartlin - ImposterWomanKedgeBay.ogg]]

#### ImposterWomanTrove
While climbing along a ridge, we sighted a large amount of Verisium on the far side of the island. When I became trapped here, my son took his crew in search of that trove. Please, find them! It's been so long, I'm certain they must have run into trouble!
![[Freya Hartlin - ImposterWomanTrove.ogg]]

#### ImposterWomanPlayerReturnsWithVerisium
My boy is dead? In my heart, I knew. He'd been gone so long. My family line is over, and life no longer has meaning. I don't know what to do now. Please, forge that Verisium into spikes and get me out of here, so that I may go lay down and die next to the body of my son.
![[Freya Hartlin - ImposterWomanPlayerReturnsWithVerisium.ogg]]

#### ImposterWomanPlayerReturnsWithSpikes
My boy is dead? I knew. In my heart, I knew. He'd been gone so long. My family line is over, and life no longer has meaning. I don't know what to do now. Please, use those spikes and get me out of here, so that I may go lay down and die next to the body of my son.
![[Freya Hartlin - ImposterWomanPlayerReturnsWithSpikes.ogg]]

#### ImposterWomanOnBlacksmith
You should be able to find a skilled blacksmith among the Kalguurans at Kingsmarch. He can't be just anyone. He has to be able to forge runes.
![[Freya Hartlin - ImposterWomanOnBlacksmith.ogg]]

#### ImposterWomanOnDannig
Yes, I know Dannig. As the leader of Kingsmarch, he should be able to direct you to a Kalguuran blacksmith with the proper skills!
![[Freya Hartlin - ImposterWomanOnDannig.ogg]]

#### Verisium Spikes
You have the Verisium spikes? Quickly, impale these totems!
![[Freya Hartlin - Verisium Spikes.ogg]]

#### Freya_Wild_FreyaTrapped_A
Please hurry! I feel I could die at any moment. Oh! Cadigan preserve me!
![[Freya Hartlin - Freya_Wild_FreyaTrapped_A.ogg]]

#### Freya_Wild_FreyaTrapped_C
You must forgive me. This has been a nightmare.
![[Freya Hartlin - Freya_Wild_FreyaTrapped_C.ogg]]

#### Freya_Wild_FreyaTrapped_F
We crashed upon these unseen shoals.
![[Freya Hartlin - Freya_Wild_FreyaTrapped_F.ogg]]

#### Freya_Wild_FreyaTrapped_G
Oh, how I've missed home!
![[Freya Hartlin - Freya_Wild_FreyaTrapped_G.ogg]]

#### Freya_Wild_FreyaTrapped_H
I long to walk once more under the sun, in those softly waving fields...
![[Freya Hartlin - Freya_Wild_FreyaTrapped_H.ogg]]

#### Freya_Wild_FreyaTrapped_J
Oh! My head... it aches.
![[Freya Hartlin - Freya_Wild_FreyaTrapped_J.ogg]]

#### Freya_Wild_FreyaTrapped_M
Yes... I think I'll rest now.
![[Freya Hartlin - Freya_Wild_FreyaTrapped_M.ogg]]

#### Freya_Wild_FreyaTrappedIdle_A
What are you doing? Please... help me.
![[Freya Hartlin - Freya_Wild_FreyaTrappedIdle_A.ogg]]

#### Freya_Wild_FreyaTrappedIdle_C
I can't go on... much... longer...
![[Freya Hartlin - Freya_Wild_FreyaTrappedIdle_C.ogg]]

#### Freya_Wild_FreyaTrappedIdle_E
I see a light... Oh... it's so bright and lovely...
![[Freya Hartlin - Freya_Wild_FreyaTrappedIdle_E.ogg]]
