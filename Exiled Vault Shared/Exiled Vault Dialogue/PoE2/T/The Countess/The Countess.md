Cedrus! Does your betrayal have no limit?

Oh my dear friend, it already is.

Kill them!

#### A5CountessEncourage_02
Don't hold back!

#### A5CountessEncourage_03
Utopia is within our grasp!

#### A5CountessLumeriusDeathReact_01
No! {No!} My son! What have they done!

#### A5CountessLumeriusDeathReact_02
No! There is still time! We will have utopia!

Ah! {Arghhhhhh!}

#### CountessA1SoMean
I think not. I expected so much more from you. Since you are too weak to do the job, I'll find someone who can. Goodbye, {'husband.'}

#### CountessA1PlayerDies1
That corpse should prove rather exceptional. Feed it to the Beast!

Yes, protect the Beast!

#### CountessA2Opener1
You again! The fool under the Hooded One's sway. Do you even know what he is? No matter. You'll find my King far more capable than Count Geonor. My King take the power you were promised. Put an end to this nuisance!

I always do.

Show them the might of the Faridun, my King!

We're running out of time. End this!

You really are becoming quite a nuisance...

#### CountessA4_OverlordFight_PreEmerge
My life's work is about to be finished. The Twilight Order will see to it that the world is remade. A world without gods... without suffering... without the disease of Divinity. You and your shade cannot stop us. First Herald... deal with them.

#### CountessA4_OverlordFight_EndFight
You will be remembered.
