Please, please, please! Take me with you, please!
![[Kanu - Kanu_Wild_DigsitePlead.ogg]]

#### Kanu_Wild_PleadOnBeast
Agh! Wait... wait, wait, I know where they're keeping the Beast! Oriath! They're in Oriath - please, forgive me Makoru!
![[Kanu - Kanu_Wild_PleadOnBeast.ogg]]

#### Kanu_Wild_DeathLine
What? Wha... no no -
![[Kanu - Kanu_Wild_DeathLine.ogg]]

#### Kanu_Banter_ReturningHome_B2
Makoru is no weakling. I couldn't {twist her mind} even if I tried. You know that.
![[Kanu - Kanu_Banter_ReturningHome_B2.ogg]]

#### Kanu_Banter_BigFish_A1
So Chieftain, how's the fishing out there lately?
![[Kanu - Kanu_Banter_BigFish_A1.ogg]]

#### Kanu_Banter_BigFish_B1
You are one of the best fishermen I've seen! Come on... any big ones?
![[Kanu - Kanu_Banter_BigFish_B1.ogg]]

#### Kanu_Banter_BigFish_C1
Twice the size of Fat Kono?
![[Kanu - Kanu_Banter_BigFish_C1.ogg]]

#### Kanu_Banter_BigFish_D1
Damn. That {is} big.
![[Kanu - Kanu_Banter_BigFish_D1.ogg]]

#### Kanu_Banter_BigFish_E1
I have my own flow these days. That's my 'Way'.
![[Kanu - Kanu_Banter_BigFish_E1.ogg]]

#### Kanu_Wild_IntroCallout
Ahoy there, mate! Over here!
![[Kanu - Kanu_Wild_IntroCallout.ogg]]

#### Kanu_Wild_IslandTalkInterruption_Random
Oh... okay then.
![[Kanu - Kanu_Wild_IslandTalkInterruption_Random.ogg]]

#### Kanu_Wild_IslandTalkInterruption_4
Fine, fine. Talk later.
![[Kanu - Kanu_Wild_IslandTalkInterruption_4.ogg]]

#### Kanu_Wild_IslandTalkInterruption_7
Okay, good luck then.
![[Kanu - Kanu_Wild_IslandTalkInterruption_7.ogg]]

#### Kanu_Wild_IslandTalkInterruption_10
Alright. I'll talk to myself.
![[Kanu - Kanu_Wild_IslandTalkInterruption_10.ogg]]

#### Kanu_Wild_IslandTalkInterruption_11
Alright. I'll just talk to myself.
![[Kanu - Kanu_Wild_IslandTalkInterruption_11.ogg]]

#### Kanu_Wild_IslandTalkInterruption_12
Phiff, impatient aren't you?
![[Kanu - Kanu_Wild_IslandTalkInterruption_12.ogg]]

#### Kanu_Wild_IslandTalkInterruption_15
Ahh... don't wanna know, eh?
![[Kanu - Kanu_Wild_IslandTalkInterruption_15.ogg]]

#### Kanu_Wild_IslandTalk_IsleOfKin
Be wary here. The Kinfolk are a bit crazed lately... They used to be nothing more than a nuisance. But now that volcano rumbles like it's hungry, and you can see them carting sulphite down there non-stop. The mountain must be alive... and oh boy, it's got an appetite.
![[Kanu - Kanu_Wild_IslandTalk_IsleOfKin.ogg]]

#### Kanu_Wild_IslandTalk_JourneysEnd
We shouldn't be here. This place hates us. Can't you feel it?! I keep seeing angry faces in the fog...
![[Kanu - Kanu_Wild_IslandTalk_JourneysEnd.ogg]]

#### Kanu_Wild_IslandTalk_Whakapanu
This island looks nice... beautiful even. But they say anyone who settles here goes missing. The thing is, I spent a week on this beach a couple summers ago. I didn't see a damn thing. I did drink pretty heavily though. Nah. Rumours and tales. You'll be fine!
![[Kanu - Kanu_Wild_IslandTalk_Whakapanu.ogg]]

#### Kanu_Wild_IslandTalk_EyeOfHinekora
Oh... I'm in awe. My family has come here to speak to our ancestors on occasion... but I've never been. Feels strange to think I'll end up here one day. Well... that's assuming they let me in... heh.
![[Kanu - Kanu_Wild_IslandTalk_EyeOfHinekora.ogg]]

#### Kanu_Wild_IslandTalk_AbandonedPrison
In the Kingsmarch tavern, sailors whisper about clanking and roaring coming from that prison. Though it was abandoned long ago, it seems there are still folks kicking around in there. I don't know much more about this place. No one does. Watch your back.
![[Kanu - Kanu_Wild_IslandTalk_AbandonedPrison.ogg]]

#### Kanu_Wild_IslandTalk_ShrikeIsland
I left Ngakanu before I was even old enough to run the Isle of Shrikes. Because of that, in the eyes of the Karui, I'm not a man. I didn't pass the test. It's a ridiculous tradition... and I know a few ladies who can vouch for my manhood...
![[Kanu - Kanu_Wild_IslandTalk_ShrikeIsland.ogg]]

#### Kanu_Wild_IslandTalk_Arastas
They're nice here. They'll feed you and give you a bed for the night. And there's always a listening ear. Taken them up on it a couple times myself, when I had nowhere else to go.
![[Kanu - Kanu_Wild_IslandTalk_Arastas.ogg]]

#### Kanu_Wild_IslandTalk_Ngakanu
They're polite to me here, but I can tell they consider me an outsider now. It shouldn't be like this... Maybe one day, things will be different. Just probably not while Tavakai leads the tribe.
![[Kanu - Kanu_Wild_IslandTalk_Ngakanu.ogg]]

#### Kanu_Wild_IslandTalk_TreasureIsland
I used to dream about exploring. Finding buried treasure. Still do! But, uh, I'll wait in the boat for this one.
![[Kanu - Kanu_Wild_IslandTalk_TreasureIsland.ogg]]

#### Kanu_Wild_IslandTalk_PirateIsland
The Brinerot are rough buggers. Heard some stories from the crew about what they get up to. Hard to believe pirates are still out and about, causing mayhem, pillaging the sea. I won't bat an eye for whatever you put them through. It's probably deserved.
![[Kanu - Kanu_Wild_IslandTalk_PirateIsland.ogg]]

#### KanuA4_ClimbDownToBoat_Random
Ahoy!
![[Kanu - KanuA4_ClimbDownToBoat_Random.ogg]]

#### KanuA4_ClimbDownToBoat_5
Let's go!
![[Kanu - KanuA4_ClimbDownToBoat_5.ogg]]

#### KanuA4_ClimbDownToBoat_9
As you wish!
![[Kanu - KanuA4_ClimbDownToBoat_9.ogg]]

#### KanuA4_ClimbDownToBoat_13
I'm on it!
![[Kanu - KanuA4_ClimbDownToBoat_13.ogg]]

#### KanuA4_ClimbDownToBoat_17
Land ahoy!
![[Kanu - KanuA4_ClimbDownToBoat_17.ogg]]

#### KanuA4_RowFinish_Random
There you go!
![[Kanu - KanuA4_RowFinish_Random.ogg]]

#### KanuA4_RowFinish_5
Watch your step, aye?
![[Kanu - KanuA4_RowFinish_5.ogg]]

#### KanuA4_RowFinish_9
We made it.
![[Kanu - KanuA4_RowFinish_9.ogg]]

#### KanuA4_RowFinish_13
Here we are.
![[Kanu - KanuA4_RowFinish_13.ogg]]

#### KanuA4_RowFinish_17
We've arrived.
