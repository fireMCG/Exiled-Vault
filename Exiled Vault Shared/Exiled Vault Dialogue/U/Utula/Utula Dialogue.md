## Utula Dialogue
#### Introduction
I do not know you, nor you me, but I honour you all the same. Anointed in Templar blood, you come to us, give us the reason, the hope, to rise up. The Tormented One has spoken. Kitava, the immortal slave, understands our plight like no other. He speaks through you, warrior. He tells us that we shall be free. Utula Makora is what they call me, and I've the miserable task of being chief to this lot. Well, I put the steel in their hands. I tell them where to stab, where to run, where to die. If that doesn't make me a chief, what does, eh?
![[Utula - Introduction.ogg]]

#### Introduction_2
Templar murders Templar. Not a pretty sight, but it was enough to get this sorry lot up and fighting. The Tormented One promised us a sign. You're not quite what I expected, but then who am I to argue with Kitava, the immortal slave. He speaks through you, Templar. He tells us that we shall be free. Utula Makora is what they call me and I've the miserable task of being chief to this lot. Well, I put the steel in their hands. I tell them where to stab, where to run, where to die. If that doesn't make me a chief, what does, eh?
![[Utula - Introduction_2.ogg]]

#### Introduction_3
Hah! After everything I've done, it took an Oriathan to get these slaves up off their shackled arses and fighting. I guess the Templar should have treated their 'lessers' better than their slaves, eh? Well, I'm not about to turn down a gift from Kitava. If he wants slave and outcast to join hands then let's remind these Templar that they're flesh and blood, just like us. Utula Makora is what they call me. I'm what passes for a chief around here. Well, I put the steel in their hands. I tell them where to stab, where to run, where to die. If that doesn't make me a chief, what does, eh?
![[Utula - Introduction_3.ogg]]

#### Justicar Casticus
Blood isn't the only currency we need to earn to buy our freedom. We can kill all the Templar mongrels we like out there. It won't matter a damn if we don't get inside their stronghold, the Templar Courts. Might as well put my bloody chains back on right now! Problem is, there's some sort of witchery surrounding the place. Only those who 'see the truth with faithful eyes' are getting in there. The power of Innocence... it's all in the eyes, you see. Yet blessed Kitava has answered my prayers and sent us just the pair of eyes we need. The ever faithful Justicar Casticus. He's there in the Control Blocks right now, smiting my people with self righteous fury. Find him, and rip his faithful eyes out. Then I'm sure the good Justicar will be kind enough to 'see' you into the Templar Courts.
![[Utula - Justicar Casticus.ogg]]

#### Justicar Casticus_2
Hah! So you made Justicar Casticus 'see the light', did you? Couldn't have happened to a nicer fulla. Yet now I've an even more charming chap for you to make the acquaintance of. He's over at the Chamber of Innocence, beyond the Templar Courts, and I bet he's just dying to meet you. It's High Templar Avarius I'm talking about, although he's so filled to the eyeballs with Innocence that it's hard to tell where the man ends and the god begins these days. That's good news for us. Kill the man and you kill the god. And what are the Templar without their god? Lambs in a slaughterhouse.
![[Utula - Justicar Casticus_2.ogg]]

#### Slave Pens
Take a deep breath. Inhale the twin stink of exploitation and oppression. Yes, these pens and cells have been our home away from home since the first Karui were brought here by Marceus Lioneye. Their great 'Hero of the Empire', one of the best slavers they ever had. Not that he was the only one. Captain Sigmund Fairgraves funded many an expedition off the whipped backs of Karui children. High Templar Dominus was only the latest in a long line of men to grow rich by trading in misery. Oriathan wealth was built on Karui poverty. Oriathan gold will forever be stained red by Karui blood.
![[Utula - Slave Pens.ogg]]

#### Lani
Lani's a pretty tough girl, for a half-blood. Her mother was Karui, but her father... a lord with a nose for island flowers. Despite that Oriathan stain in her blood, Lani risked her life, time and time again, slipping us the information that she bore between the lords and ladies of Theopolis. Honestly couldn't have put the pieces of this uprising together without her. And she's a fighter. Struck down two overseers before a third managed to put that scratch on her. Don't worry, it won't slow her down for long. Not Lani.
![[Utula - Lani.ogg]]

#### Vilenta
If it weren't for Lani, I'd have cut that bitch's throat the moment I met her. But Vilenta seems to know her medicine, so she gets to live... until Lani is better. Then Vilenta will answer for her crimes against us.
![[Utula - Vilenta.ogg]]

#### Overseer's Tower
Overseer's Tower, this place is called. And you know the worst thing about the men who stood here, watching us, cursing us, descending to whip and kick us like curs? They were slaves, like us, willing to turn on their brethren for a bigger cage and a few extra rations. I can't quite put into words what a pleasure it was to take this tower, to rip the greedy eyes from those traitors. Did they see it coming? I hope so.
![[Utula - Overseer's Tower.ogg]]

#### Kitava
Well... I know his other names. The Black Spirit. The Cannibal King. The Ravenous One. He was all of those things, before Tukohama slashed out his eyes, before Valako drowned him in the sea, before Hinekora whipped him and condemned him to immortal darkness. Kitava has learned from the suffering inflicted upon him. Learned what cruelty is from his own flesh and blood. Learned what it means to be a slave. Now he hungers for freedom. Not merely for himself. For all of us who have suffered under whip and shackle. Kitava is the Tormented One, destined to rise up from the darkness and banish cruelty from this world. And we, his children, rise with him.
![[Utula - Kitava.ogg]]

#### Innocence
Old red eyes. He's been quiet for a long time. Just like Kitava... and Tukohama. All of the old gods. Now Innocence has woken up, and with him, power like I've never seen the Templar wield before. It's alright though. We slaves, we've got our own god looking out for us now. I can see him in the eyes of my brothers and sisters, smell him in the blood we've spilled, hear his call in the screams of the fallen. I don't rightly know where the gods have been or what's brought them crawling back. Nor do I really care. All I need to know, my friend, is that we're not alone anymore.
![[Utula - Innocence.ogg]]

#### Templar Court
There's two parts to the Templar. The grim face and the spotty arse. Out front you've got the Templar Courts, usually the last place our {hatungo} see if they're stupid enough to preach their craft within a Templar's hearing. Oriath's wood-mongers must do a roaring trade with that place. When the wind blows right, you can even smell the aroma of barbequed blasphemer from here. The arse end, that's the Chamber of Innocence. It's where the real earnest believing gets done. Where the young Templar go to pay their respects to God almighty and get the good sense baptised out of their heads. I've not seen inside the chamber myself, but you can feel it from over a block away. Like there's an eye in your gut, peering through your insides, looking for even the tiniest stain of Sin. I tell you, sane people go in one end of that place, ash and apostles come out the other. Watch yourself in there.
![[Utula - Templar Court.ogg]]

#### High Templar Avarius
With Dominus away in Wraeclast, someone had to keep the wheels of oppression turning. Avarius was only too happy to take the job. He'd had plenty of practice already, of course. It was Avarius who led some of the largest and most crippling raids upon the Ngamakanui and the Ngakuramakoi. It was on his orders that men, women and children were shackled and shipped like cattle to Theopolis. And it was Avarius who spent five thousand Karui lives building his Templar Courts and his Chamber of Innocence. Who had wives and daughters scrub their husbands' and fathers' blood from the stones so as to preserve their 'purity'. When you meet Avarius, feel free to exact a little extra vengeance in the name of Karui suffering.
![[Utula - High Templar Avarius.ogg]]

#### UtulaRuinedSquare
Cup your hands, children of Kitava. Drink of the hot, sweet wine of Oriath. And let us stay ourselves from the feast no longer. For our king is ravenous!

May this 'pillar of tradition' fall!

Arrogant and aloof leaves one alone and ripe for defeat!

I've never even heard of Kahuturoa! What are we watching?

Burn it all down, Kaom the conqueror!

We are not here to 'have fun,' half-blood! Act like a real Karui!
![[Utula - UtulaCommentsOnAhuana.ogg]]

#### UtulaFightBeginsPlayerWonLast1
You were lucky last time! Your luck is about to run out!

#### UtulaFightBeginsPlayerLostLast1
You're about to lose again. No mercy!
![[Utula - UtulaFightBeginsPlayerLostLast1.ogg]]

#### UtulaFightBeginsPlayerMoreSoldiers1
Surrounding yourself with other warriors won't save you!

Ha! We outnumber you! This will be easy!
![[Utula - UtulaFightBeginsPlayerLessSoldiers1.ogg]]

#### UtulaFightBeginsPlayerMoreItems1
So much equipment. Your chains are all the heavier!
![[Utula - UtulaFightBeginsPlayerMoreItems1.ogg]]

#### UtulaFightBeginsPlayerLessItems1
You seem rather unprepared for this battle!
![[Utula - UtulaFightBeginsPlayerLessItems1.ogg]]

Look at this battlefield. So strategic. It won't change the outcome!
![[Utula - UtulaFightBeginsPlayerMoreFieldItems1.ogg]]

#### UtulaCommentRecruitRecruit1
Fine.
![[Utula - UtulaCommentRecruitRecruit1.ogg]]

#### UtulaCommentRecruitRecruit3
Go ahead then.
![[Utula - UtulaCommentRecruitRecruit3.ogg]]

#### Ahuana's Defeat
Maybe defeating the half-blood will dim her relentless positivity, but somehow I doubt we're that lucky.
![[Utula - Ahuana's Defeat.ogg]]

#### Ahuana's Victory
I'm sure the smiling half-blood will be kind about defeating you. How ridiculous.
![[Utula - Ahuana's Victory.ogg]]

#### Akoya's Defeat
Yes! Akoya must be feeling the sting of defeat right about now. Delicious.
![[Utula - Akoya's Defeat.ogg]]

#### Akoya's Victory
Don't let Akoya win again. She's already the worst one here.
![[Utula - Akoya's Victory.ogg]]

#### Kahuturoa's Victory
Kahuturoa is a good example of why we must change this place. He hardly cares that he lost to you. I doubt the dumbarse even knows what's going on.
![[Utula - Kahuturoa's Victory.ogg]]

#### UtulaPlayerLostVsKahuturoa
I was not aware that ancient Karui like Kahuturoa could fight like that. Why have we not advanced more in all this time?
![[Utula - UtulaPlayerLostVsKahuturoa.ogg]]

#### Kiloava's Defeat
The famed Kiloava, the first Herald of War, defeated by one such as yourself. These people are so disappointing.
![[Utula - Kiloava's Defeat.ogg]]

#### Kiloava's Victory
Kiloava is a name I heard in stories as a child. Our {hatungo} spoke of him as the first Herald of War. It's no surprise he beat you.
![[Utula - Kiloava's Victory.ogg]]

#### Maata's Defeat
What fools they are, bringing a peacemaker here. Of course you kicked his arse.
![[Utula - Maata's Defeat.ogg]]

#### Maata's Victory
You lost to an old man, a {diplomat}. I knew his kind in the slave pens. He'd have turned on his own to become an overseer. I'd cut his throat if he weren't already dead.
![[Utula - Maata's Victory.ogg]]

#### Rakiata's Defeat
Rakiata fights strangely. Your victory over her made waves among the others. Keep doing that. Keep winning.
![[Utula - Rakiata's Defeat.ogg]]

#### Rakiata's Victory
Hmm... fight Rakiata again, even though you lost. I'm suspicious of something... I must see her fight more.
![[Utula - Rakiata's Victory.ogg]]

#### Tawhanuku's Defeat
It was good that you got one over on Tawhanuku. I have yet to determine whether the Hinekora tribe are our jailors, or fellow slaves. We shall see.
![[Utula - Tawhanuku's Defeat.ogg]]

#### Tawhanuku's Victory
If you cannot defeat the Hinekora Tribe in battle, then we will never get out of here. Try harder.
![[Utula - Tawhanuku's Victory.ogg]]

#### Ikiaho's Defeat
Ikiaho knows something. Something hides behind her grimness. Keep defeating her. We must demoralise her. Then, maybe she will talk to me...
![[Utula - Ikiaho's Defeat.ogg]]

#### Ikiaho's Victory
Strange, how well Arohongui's brood fights. I'll keep an eye on them.
![[Utula - Ikiaho's Victory.ogg]]

#### Kaom's Defeat
You defeated the legendary Kaom in battle. I've never seen anything quite like it.
![[Utula - Kaom's Defeat.ogg]]

#### Kaom's Victory
Kaom united an empire of squabbling Karui tribes, and unleashed a sequence of events that eventually destroyed the Eternal Empire. Of course you lost to him. Get over it.
![[Utula - Kaom's Victory.ogg]]

#### Utula's Defeat
You take this nonsense far too seriously.
![[Utula - Utula's Defeat.ogg]]

#### Utula's Victory
You will not defeat me so easily. I suppose we have a very long time for you to try again, since I can never leave this place.
![[Utula - Utula's Victory.ogg]]

#### Match Win
Perhaps you are the ally I am looking for in this prison...
![[Utula - Match Win.ogg]]

#### Match Loss
If we are going to stage a prison break here, I am going to need you to be far stronger than that.
![[Utula - Match Loss.ogg]]

#### UtulaCommentOnPurchaseItemKaom
Yes, Kaom, give your aid...
![[Utula - UtulaCommentOnPurchaseItemKaom.ogg]]

#### UtulaCommentOnPurchaseEliteKaom
Not bad.
![[Utula - UtulaCommentOnPurchaseEliteKaom.ogg]]

#### UtulaRandomShout1
Kitava will one day return to consume all the souls in this domain!
![[Utula - UtulaRandomShout1.ogg]]

#### UtulaRandomShout2
Forget the rules! Let us revel in blood and madness!
![[Utula - UtulaRandomShout2.ogg]]

#### UtulaRandomShout3
How do I get to the Chambers of the Dishonoured! I should be there, not here!
![[Utula - UtulaRandomShout3.ogg]]

#### UtulaRandomShout5
Why must we remain in this place?
![[Utula - UtulaRandomShout5.ogg]]

#### UtulaRandomShout6
I miss the sun!
![[Utula - UtulaRandomShout6.ogg]]

#### You
So, it's you. Come to kill me again? Tough luck, since I'm already dead. Did you get yourself killed too? No, I can sense some tether to life about you. Whatever. I don't care.
![[Utula - You.ogg]]

#### Kitava's Defeat
The Father of Hunger may be dead, but his essence lives on in his people. I challenge my fellow Karui. How dare we accept this fate? How dare we accept these Halls of the Dead? We should be free, to roam the world, or enter oblivion if we wish! Kitava once promised to devour all the souls in this domain, and it seems I must fulfill that promise!
![[Utula - Kitava's Defeat.ogg]]

#### The Halls of the Dead
Imagine my surprise when you killed me and I found myself in this dank and dour dungeon. I didn't even know about this place. I grew up in the slave pens, and my knowledge of my own culture was fragmented at best. When the blood spilled out of me and my heart stilled, I thought I was finally free. No. I still exist, because Hinekora scooped up my soul, and they even 'honoured' me with a position here. You know what I'll be doing? Fighting. Bleeding. Dying. {Forever.} I died! I'm dead! But I'm still imprisoned! This is a load of horse dung the size of Wraeclast! This place will burn!
![[Utula - The Halls of the Dead.ogg]]

#### Hinekora
Hinekora is our jailer. I imagine she had good intentions when she made this place. Preserve the souls of the Karui so that they may guide their descendants, sure. Sounds lovely. Then, she went to sleep for thousands of years. All the souls of my people have been collecting here unattended ever since. That seems like a massive blunder. I don't care that she's awake now. She's hardly present. There's no way she's the same as she was, not after a sleep like that. We're stuck in a prison without a warden, and there is {no way out.}
![[Utula - Hinekora.ogg]]

#### Rakiata
You know what's strange? I always thought Rakiata was a man. I suppose I don't know much about my own people, beyond the remnants of knowledge the slaves passed on in Oriath's pens. Coming here, I'm furious at how much of my own history was denied me. I'm basically locked in a permanent family reunion with relatives I've never met.
![[Utula - Rakiata.ogg]]

#### The End of Time
They tell me I am here until the end of Time itself. When I ask how long that is, they all give me a different answer. I don't think any of them actually know. They console themselves with tales of endings and rebirths, but I think they're terrified of the most likely possibility. What if Time never ends at all? What if we are here {forever?} That Rongokurai chieftain has been here thousands of years already, and he's gone a bit off. What happens when we've all been here for ten thousand years? A {million} years? We'll be stark raving mad, and we'll {never get out}, unless we unite and assault the walls of this prison directly!
![[Utula - The End of Time.ogg]]

#### The Karui Way
The Way means nothing to me. Where were my fellow Karui tribes when we prisoners were rotting in slave pens since the time of Lioneye? I guess nobody was very interested in rescuing us. What does all that strength matter if it only benefits the strong? I was born into slavery. I never had a choice. I refuse to continue being a prisoner in my own afterlife!
![[Utula - The Karui Way.ogg]]

#### UtulaConversationsWithKaomOne
By the hand of the same Exile that recently showed you a thing or two.
