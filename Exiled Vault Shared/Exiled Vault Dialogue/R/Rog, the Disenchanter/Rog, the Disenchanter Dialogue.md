Hello, stranger. Come to grow this little town with us? With some hard work, we'll make it our own. I've got dreams, too. One day, my own shop, right here in Kingsmarch. I'm going to call it 'Rog's Rare Reagents.' Til then, I'll pay my dues. I know a thing or two about {disenchantment.} We should build an apothecary here. You might be surprised at what we discover.

We're out of funding. Can't do anything at the moment.

Ho hoh, things are looking up!
![[Rog, the Disenchanter - RogSettlersAddItemGeneric_14.ogg]]

#### RogSettlersAddItemGeneric_17
Onward and upward, as Dannig might say.
![[Rog, the Disenchanter - RogSettlersAddItemGeneric_17.ogg]]

#### Kingsmarch
When we first arrived, we didn't intend for this to be anything permanent. It was more of a supply dump so we wouldn't have to keep going back to our ship. That was {my} idea. Heh heh! In the course of our expeditions, we built it up bit by bit. Eventually, it felt something like home. People back in Kalguur became interested in joining us, for adventure, opportunity, or freedom. Word must have gotten out, because that's when Johan arrived with the King's charter.
![[Rog, the Disenchanter - Kingsmarch.ogg]]

#### The Charter
The charter for Kingsmarch brings many Kalguuran laws to Wraeclast, including our guild associations and criminal penalties. There is very little enforcement for most of it right now... there are only two things on Wraeclast the King seems to truly care about. One of those things is {taxes.} Ugh.
![[Rog, the Disenchanter - The Charter.ogg]]

#### Taxes
I like to think I'm a kind man. I mean, don't we all? But these taxes ooh, I just no, no, Rog, don't let it get to you... the dream is still alive...
![[Rog, the Disenchanter - Taxes.ogg]]

#### RogSettlersOnKalguurans
Oh, what to say about my people? Many of us here on Wraeclast are in various guilds. I'm in the Meridian Free Traders, the trade guild that executes the King's charter for Kingsmarch. You can't beat our logistics! Heh heh. Dannig is in the Artificers' Guild these days, and, Tujen's a freelance harbourmaster, but he stays close. Gotta keep the family together, you know?
![[Rog, the Disenchanter - RogSettlersOnKalguurans.ogg]]

#### Ideas List
Rog's Fantastical Items... Rog's Apothecary Extraordinaire... Rog's Rare Amazements... Rog's Amazing Rarities... Rog and Gwennen's Extraordinary Emporium...?
![[Rog, the Disenchanter - Ideas List.ogg]]

#### RogSettlersWildBuildShop
One step closer to the dream.
![[Rog, the Disenchanter - RogSettlersWildBuildShop.ogg]]

#### RogSettlersWildToHimself_Random
In our next game, I should have them fight one of those 'gods'...
![[Rog, the Disenchanter - RogSettlersWildToHimself_Random.ogg]]

#### RogSettlersWildToHimself_2
Dannig can attend that night, but Tujen can't...
![[Rog, the Disenchanter - RogSettlersWildToHimself_2.ogg]]

#### RogSettlersWildToHimself_3
Tujen can attend {that} night, but Gwennen can't...
![[Rog, the Disenchanter - RogSettlersWildToHimself_3.ogg]]

#### RogSettlersWildToHimself_4
Gwennen can attend the day before, but Dannig can't...
![[Rog, the Disenchanter - RogSettlersWildToHimself_4.ogg]]

#### RogSettlersConvoTujen
Oh, who knows, It's tough getting everyone together at the same time.
![[Rog, the Disenchanter - RogSettlersConvoTujen.ogg]]

#### RogSettlersConvoIslaOne
We do! Would you like to join us? It involves roleplaying.
![[Rog, the Disenchanter - RogSettlersConvoIslaOne.ogg]]

#### RogSettlersConvoIslaTwo
Uhh... we might be talking about different things.
![[Rog, the Disenchanter - RogSettlersConvoIslaTwo.ogg]]

#### RogSettlersConvoDannig
Oh, you know, one step at a time.
![[Rog, the Disenchanter - RogSettlersConvoDannig.ogg]]

#### RogSettlersOnApproachNoShop_Random
Hello!
![[Rog, the Disenchanter - RogSettlersOnApproachNoShop_Random.ogg]]

#### RogSettlersOnApproachNoShop_3
Hellooo!
![[Rog, the Disenchanter - RogSettlersOnApproachNoShop_3.ogg]]

#### RogSettlersOnApproach_5
We're always open.
![[Rog, the Disenchanter - RogSettlersOnApproach_5.ogg]]

#### RogSettlersOnApproach_9
Come on in.
![[Rog, the Disenchanter - RogSettlersOnApproach_9.ogg]]

#### RogSettlersOnApproachNoShop_5
What can I do for you?
![[Rog, the Disenchanter - RogSettlersOnApproachNoShop_5.ogg]]
