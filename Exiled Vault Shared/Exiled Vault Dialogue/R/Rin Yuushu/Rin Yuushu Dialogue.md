## Rin Yuushu Dialogue
#### RinPrimaryDefenderStartsFightZero
You are a blight on this beautiful continent. We are the cure.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinPrimaryDefenderStartsFightZero.ogg]]

#### RinPrimaryDefenderStartsFightOne
That you've made it this far is an insult, muckblood.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinPrimaryDefenderStartsFightOne.ogg]]

#### RinPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwo
Robbery, is it? Where I come from, we skin robbers alive.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwo.ogg]]

#### RinPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThree
It seems a rat has wandered into our hallowed halls.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThree.ogg]]

#### RinPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFour
The trap is sprung, little rat.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFour.ogg]]

#### RinPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFive
All that time in the darkness has only made me hate you more.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFive.ogg]]

#### RinPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSix
I can't believe I debased myself by cutting a deal with you.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSix.ogg]]

#### RinPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSeven
My loyalties have been realigned, muckblood. Don't expect a repeat of when last we met.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSeven.ogg]]

#### RinPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEight
I can still feel the cold creep of death when I close my eyes. Don't worry, you'll feel it soon enough.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEight.ogg]]

#### RinPrimaryDefenderStartsFightNine
Do you remember your defeat at my hand? You will.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinPrimaryDefenderStartsFightNine.ogg]]

#### RinPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTen
Run, run, little rat. My arrows will still find you.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTen.ogg]]

#### RinPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEleven
A riddle for you, Exile. How can one person be everywhere at once?
![[Rin Yuushu - RinPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEleven.ogg]]

#### RinPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwelve
Embrace the snow, or be buried.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwelve.ogg]]

#### RinPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThirteen
The blizzard answers my call!
![[Rin Yuushu - RinPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThirteen.ogg]]

#### RinPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFourteen
With these boots I can shrug off the elements, even though the cold never bothered me anyway!
![[Rin Yuushu - RinPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFourteen.ogg]]

#### RinSafehouseLeaderIntroZero
We are born leaders. You? You were born to serve us.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinSafehouseLeaderIntroZero.ogg]]

#### RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero
You've let them see too much. Slaughter them.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero.ogg]]

#### RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne
Imbecile! Don't neglect the cargo!
![[Rin Yuushu - RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne.ogg]]

#### RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo
Feels as though the walls are closing in, doesn't it Exile?
![[Rin Yuushu - RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo.ogg]]

#### RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree
We are everywhere.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree.ogg]]

#### RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour
Watch carefully, Exile. You won't see much else.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour.ogg]]

#### RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive
I'm honoured to serve such a noble cause.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive.ogg]]

#### RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix
Can your people do nothing right, Karui?
![[Rin Yuushu - RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix.ogg]]

#### RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven
The sooner this is over, the sooner you can go back to the seas, pirate.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven.ogg]]

#### RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight
Don't make me regret this, disgusting demon.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight.ogg]]

#### RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine
Disgusting. Fight like a nobleman, Ezomyte.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine.ogg]]

#### RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalTen
Try not to get us killed, fire worshipper.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalTen.ogg]]

#### RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalEleven
We fight for a pure future!
![[Rin Yuushu - RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalEleven.ogg]]

#### RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwelve
I'd sooner kill you myself than lose our claim here.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwelve.ogg]]

#### RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirteen
The others will be so sad to hear of your untimely demise...
![[Rin Yuushu - RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirteen.ogg]]

#### RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalFourteen
You should never have crossed me.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalFourteen.ogg]]

#### RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalFifteen
I'm here to clean up your mess, yourself included.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalFifteen.ogg]]

#### RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalSixteen
Brinerot, I'll make you wish you went down with your ship.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalSixteen.ogg]]

#### RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeventeen
First, you, then the rest of your filthy little clan, Thane.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeventeen.ogg]]

#### RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalEighteen
Korell, it was only a matter of time. I'm just making the first move.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalEighteen.ogg]]

#### RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalNineteen
The Syndicate would be better off without you or your sadism.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalNineteen.ogg]]

#### RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwenty
You're devious, Maloney. Think you can keep up with me?
![[Rin Yuushu - RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwenty.ogg]]

#### RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyOne
Muckbloods, the purification begins now.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyOne.ogg]]

#### RinReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero
You won't live to regret this.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero.ogg]]

#### RinReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne
You opportunistic little worm.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne.ogg]]

#### RinReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo
You'll never see daylight again, scum.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo.ogg]]

#### RinReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree
When this is through, you'll be naught but meat for the ants.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree.ogg]]

#### RinReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour
Oh, no, you won't see it coming.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour.ogg]]

#### RinReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive
Yuck. Your kind makes even the Brinerot seem appealing.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive.ogg]]

#### RinReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix
Don't you dare touch me, beast!
![[Rin Yuushu - RinReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix.ogg]]

#### RinReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven
So that's how it is. I'm just 'Mutewind' again, like before.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven.ogg]]

#### RinReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight
Don't get caught in your own trap, beast.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight.ogg]]

#### RinReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine
Hah!
![[Rin Yuushu - RinReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine.ogg]]

#### RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyTwo
The wolves are circling you now...
![[Rin Yuushu - RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyTwo.ogg]]

#### RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyThree
It's over for you now, Exile.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyThree.ogg]]

#### RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFour
Bow to your betters, trespasser.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFour.ogg]]

#### RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFive
We will tear you to shreds.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFive.ogg]]

#### RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySix
Try not to lose another limb, underling.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySix.ogg]]

#### RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySeven
Bossing around a Brinerot? This feels right.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySeven.ogg]]

#### RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyEight
Your queen commands you to fight in her name, creature!
![[Rin Yuushu - RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyEight.ogg]]

#### RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyNine
Cunning, not might, will win the day here. Follow my orders to the letter, Thane.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyNine.ogg]]

#### RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirty
Serve me well, Korell, or I will be forced to extinguish you.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirty.ogg]]

#### RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirtyOne
Do as I have instructed you, and victory is assured.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirtyOne.ogg]]

#### RinKillPlayerZero
Good riddance.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinKillPlayerZero.ogg]]

#### RinKillPlayerOne
Lowlife. Keep moving!
![[Rin Yuushu - RinKillPlayerOne.ogg]]

#### RinKillPlayerTwo
Just another body, now.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinKillPlayerTwo.ogg]]

#### RinKillPlayerThree
Good. What's next?
![[Rin Yuushu - RinKillPlayerThree.ogg]]

#### RinEscapeZero
Worthless.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinEscapeZero.ogg]]

#### RinEscapeOne
Success was inevitable.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinEscapeOne.ogg]]

#### RinEscapeTwo
You can't win.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinEscapeTwo.ogg]]

#### RinDefeatedZero
How humiliating...!
![[Rin Yuushu - RinDefeatedZero.ogg]]

#### RinDefeatedOne
All is lost.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinDefeatedOne.ogg]]

#### RinDefeatedTwo
Unfathomable!
![[Rin Yuushu - RinDefeatedTwo.ogg]]

#### RinDefeatedThree
Our chance... squandered...
![[Rin Yuushu - RinDefeatedThree.ogg]]

#### RinDefeatedFour
No, no more prison!
![[Rin Yuushu - RinDefeatedFour.ogg]]

#### RinDefeatedFive
Gods... not again!
![[Rin Yuushu - RinDefeatedFive.ogg]]

#### RinDefeatedSix
I'm better than this!
![[Rin Yuushu - RinDefeatedSix.ogg]]

#### RinDefeatedSeven
I face death... again...
![[Rin Yuushu - RinDefeatedSeven.ogg]]

#### RinDefeatedEight
Thought it'd be as easy as last time...
![[Rin Yuushu - RinDefeatedEight.ogg]]

#### RinDefeatedNine
Damn. Miscalculated.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinDefeatedNine.ogg]]

#### RinDefeatedTen
I was blinded by fury...
![[Rin Yuushu - RinDefeatedTen.ogg]]

#### RinOfferBargainZero
Not even the Redblade are as... brutal as you. I will do as you ask, so long as you spare me.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinOfferBargainZero.ogg]]

#### RinOfferBargainOne
Kill me and prove yourself to be the savage I know you are, or... surprise me. Set me free. I can bring someone into the fold on your behalf. Talk some respect into them. Please.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinOfferBargainOne.ogg]]

#### RinOfferBargainTwo
Is my life really worth sacrificing your chance to know more? That is what you would be doing were you to kill me, Exile. Instead, let me show you how useful I could be to you. I am quick to make friends, and even quicker to learn what it is I wish to learn. Allow me the chance to prove my talents to you, and all I learn is yours.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinOfferBargainTwo.ogg]]

#### RinOfferBargainThree
I'm ill-fit for this duty. You've proven that quite clearly. Is that a crime worthy of death? I think not. Rather, I ought to look for more suitable work, don't you think?
![[Rin Yuushu - RinOfferBargainThree.ogg]]

#### RinOfferBargainFour
My Mutewind brothers and sisters warned me that leaving them would bring me nothing but darkness. Perhaps they were right. I think, if you'll allow me, I will take my leave of the Syndicate.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinOfferBargainFour.ogg]]

#### RinOfferBargainFive
You are a bloodthirsty little beast, aren't you? I almost admire it. I think if I called your bluff I'd wind up dead, so instead, I offer you this: knowledge. Knowledge of all I have learned in my post here.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinOfferBargainFive.ogg]]

#### RinOfferBargainSix
I could offer you pure Mutewind blood, or I could offer you material compensation. Take your pick.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinOfferBargainSix.ogg]]

#### RinBargainAcceptedZero
Consider me surprised. I'll do as you asked.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinBargainAcceptedZero.ogg]]

#### RinBargainAcceptedOne
I'll keep my end of the deal. Just remember this in the future.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinBargainAcceptedOne.ogg]]

#### RinBargainAcceptedTwo
You won't regret this!
![[Rin Yuushu - RinBargainAcceptedTwo.ogg]]

#### RinBargainAcceptedThree
When you meet the Lifegiver, give my regards... with a blade.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinBargainAcceptedThree.ogg]]

#### RinBargainAcceptedFour
I knew you could be... reasonable.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinBargainAcceptedFour.ogg]]

#### RinBargainAcceptedFive
A fair trade. Until next time!
![[Rin Yuushu - RinBargainAcceptedFive.ogg]]

#### RinOfferBetrayalZero
Know why the Immortal Syndicate failed here? Because they didn't have Mutewind leadership. Instead they had some muckblood running the show. Well, how about we change that?
![[Rin Yuushu - RinOfferBetrayalZero.ogg]]

#### RinOfferBetrayalOne
This is what I get for putting my trust in foreign might. Free me, and I'll show the others here how the Mutewind handle failures.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinOfferBetrayalOne.ogg]]

#### RinOfferBetrayalTwo
If you think I go into battle without a plan for every possible situation, well, you don't know me at all. My plan for this outcome? Shove the blame onto someone lesser-than. One of the nincompoops here will do, don't you think?
![[Rin Yuushu - RinOfferBetrayalTwo.ogg]]

#### RinOfferBetrayalThree
I'm not stupid. I know what you want. You want information. If you'll leave me living, I can tell you a great deal about my crewmates here.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinOfferBetrayalThree.ogg]]

#### RinOfferBetrayalFour
Gods, how I've wanted a reason to stick it to that Brinerot scoundrel. Don't disappoint me, Exile.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinOfferBetrayalFour.ogg]]

#### RinOfferBetrayalFive
Hillock's little more than a walking, talking avalanche. We Mutewind know how dangerous an avalanche can be. You should be wary, too.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinOfferBetrayalFive.ogg]]

#### RinOfferBetrayalSix
Wait! I may be a Syndicate lackey for the moment, but Jorgin has committed fratricide. Would you really let a brother-killer just walk?
![[Rin Yuushu - RinOfferBetrayalSix.ogg]]

#### RinOfferBetrayalSeven
I cannot even begin to describe how much I'd enjoy watching that fire-worshipping, muckblooded Redblade lowlife squirm.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinOfferBetrayalSeven.ogg]]

#### RinOfferBetrayalEight
Look at Maloney's eyes. The cogs are turning. He's planning something. Do you want to wait to find out what, or shall we put him in his place?
![[Rin Yuushu - RinOfferBetrayalEight.ogg]]

#### RinOfferBetrayalNine
I hate you, Exile, but only a little more than any of these other subservients. I'd harm any one of them to keep breath in my lungs.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinOfferBetrayalNine.ogg]]

#### RinOfferExecuteZero
Death is not the deterrent it once was.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinOfferExecuteZero.ogg]]

#### RinOfferExecuteOne
In front of my captain, I'll die bravely.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinOfferExecuteOne.ogg]]

#### RinOfferExecuteTwo
Let me demonstrate the proper way to die.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinOfferExecuteTwo.ogg]]

#### RinOfferExecuteThree
Enough interrogation. You insult me. Death is the only choice I'll give you this time.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinOfferExecuteThree.ogg]]

#### RinReplyToBetrayalAcceptedZero
You think I didn't expect betrayal? I'm two steps ahead.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinReplyToBetrayalAcceptedZero.ogg]]

#### RinReplyToBetrayalAcceptedOne
What did I ever do to you, Vagan?
![[Rin Yuushu - RinReplyToBetrayalAcceptedOne.ogg]]

#### RinReplyToBetrayalAcceptedTwo
You've lived down to your reputation, Brinerot.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinReplyToBetrayalAcceptedTwo.ogg]]

#### RinReplyToBetrayalAcceptedThree
Did... did you just betray me as a gift? You are the stupidest of stupid!
![[Rin Yuushu - RinReplyToBetrayalAcceptedThree.ogg]]

#### RinReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFour
I do it simply to annoy you, Jorgin, because you can never return home.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFour.ogg]]

#### RinReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFive
I thought you said the Syndicate makes past ties irrelevant.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFive.ogg]]

#### RinReplyToBetrayalAcceptedSix
I already have plans in motion to account for this betrayal, believe me.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinReplyToBetrayalAcceptedSix.ogg]]

#### RinInterrogatedZero
I'll only tell you what I want to tell you.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinInterrogatedZero.ogg]]

#### RinInterrogatedOne
No matter how many times you interrogate me, I will never break.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinInterrogatedOne.ogg]]

#### RinInterrogatedTwo
I thought we had an understanding!
![[Rin Yuushu - RinInterrogatedTwo.ogg]]

#### RinReplyToExecutionZero
The price of failure.
![[Rin Yuushu - RinReplyToExecutionZero.ogg]]

#### RinReplyToExecutionOne
You... you savage!
![[Rin Yuushu - RinReplyToExecutionOne.ogg]]

#### RinReplyToExecutionTwo
Silver linings!
![[Rin Yuushu - RinReplyToExecutionTwo.ogg]]

#### RinSafehouseLeaderDefeatedZero
I had it all planned out. How could I lose? I... I must have been sabotaged! But by who?
![[Rin Yuushu - RinSafehouseLeaderDefeatedZero.ogg]]
