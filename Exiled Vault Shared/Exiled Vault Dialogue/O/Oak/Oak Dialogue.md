## Oak Dialogue
#### The Darkness
Come to shelter from this strange weather, have you? This storm of the unreal. My usual guests knock instead of slaughtering my doormen... but you're not 'usual', are you?
![[Oak - The Darkness.ogg]]

#### The Darkness_2
It's a shame you felt compelled to dispel the climate of shadow. I was using it to my tactical advantage against those more confused remainders of Kraityn and Alira's camps. You should have checked with me before taking such dramatic action within my kingdom.

#### Hand in Amulets
Quite the rush to the head, that. You keep this, as a souvenir of your fine efforts. Now be on your way. Find yourself a patch of dirt to call your own, far from here. As you may have gathered, I have little tolerance for neighbours.

#### Oak's Rivals
I knew you were worthy. Rid this troubled land of two of its worst ailments... and before the light leaves Kraityn's and Alira's eyes, be sure to tell them that Oak sent you.

#### Oak's Rivals_2
And so a new enemy of hope rises from the ashes. Time to put you out, little flame.
![[Oak - Oak's Rivals_2.ogg]]

#### Oak's Rivals_3
Now, I could have sworn we had concluded our business and said our cordial farewells. An understanding of mutual exclusion was reached. Perhaps you need a little reminder to jog your memory... a medicinal tap on the head like I administered to Kraityn.

#### Oak's Rivals_4
You strike me as someone who craves a higher purpose. Something worthy. Something like peace. Three tribes battle for this forest. Every day my brethren and I battle and die with Kraityn's rats of the bridge, and Alira's thralls of the old road. To spare the lives of many, you need take only two. But if peace isn't reward enough for you, bring me the amulets that hang around Kraityn's and Alira's worthless necks. When joined with mine, those trinkets will forge us a new strength, you and I. The strength to bring about peace.

#### Oak's Rivals_5
So an enemy of hope has fallen. Kraityn will not be missed. Did you do it for a higher purpose, perhaps? Something worthy... like peace? Every day my brethren must battle and die with Alira's thralls of the old road. To spare the lives of many, you need take only one. But if peace isn't enough reward for you, bring me the amulet that hangs around Alira's worthless neck. I trust you have Kraityn's in hand already? I thought so. When joined with mine, those trinkets will forge us a new strength, you and I. The strength to bring about peace.

Every day my brethren must battle and die with Kraityn's bridge rats. To save the lives of many, you need take only one. But if peace isn't reward enough for you, bring me the amulet that hangs around Kraityn's worthless neck. I trust you have Alira's in hand already? I thought so. When joined with mine, those trinkets will forge us a new strength, you and I. The strength to bring about peace.

#### Oak's Rivals_7
The halfwit and the whore are dead? I never thought I'd see the day. Now I am king, unquestioned, unrivaled. A fine feeling indeed. Not much of a kingdom to speak of, but at least it's a peaceful one. But if peace isn't reward enough for you, give me the amulets that Kraityn and Alira wore around their worthless necks. When joined with mine, those trinkets will forge us a new strength, you and I. The strength to continue to do what we must.

#### Oak's Rivals_8
Kraityn sent you? But you strike me as someone who craves a higher purpose than that. Something worthy. Something like peace. Every day my brethren and I battle and die with Kraityn's rats of the bridge, and Alira's thralls of the old road. To spare the lives of many, you need take only two. But if peace isn't reward enough for you, bring me the amulets that hang around Kraityn's and Alira's worthless necks. When joined with mine, those trinkets will forge us a new strength, you and I. The strength to bring about peace.

#### Oak's Rivals_9
So Alira has fallen. A worthy achievement on your part. And yet you serve Kraityn? Not so worthy. You strike me as someone who craves a higher purpose than that. Something like... peace. Every day my brethren must battle and die with Kraityn's bridge rats. To spare the lives of many, you need take only one. But if peace isn't reward enough for you, bring me the amulet that hangs around Kraityn's worthless neck. I trust you have Alira's in hand already? I thought so. When joined with mine, those trinkets will forge us a new strength, you and I. The strength to bring about peace.

So Kraityn has fallen. A worthy achievement on your part. And yet you serve Alira? Not so worthy. You strike me as someone who craves a higher purpose than that. Something like... peace. Every day my brethren must battle and die with Alira's enthralled wretches. To spare the lives of many, you need take only one. But if peace isn't reward enough for you, bring me the amulet that hangs around Alira's worthless neck. I trust you have Kraityn's in hand already? I thought so. When joined with mine, those trinkets will forge us a new strength, you and I. The strength to bring about peace.

#### Oak's Rivals_12
And so an enemy of hope falls... I doubt Kraityn knew what hit him. Alira won't be so straightforward. There's some twisted mana in her veins. Still, a dagger in the belly? Best cure I know for unwanted enchantments.
![[Oak - Oak's Rivals_12.ogg]]

#### Oak's Rivals_13
And so an enemy of hope falls... I doubt that Alira knew what hit her. Kraityn won't be so straightforward. Those twin blades of his? He calls them his "daughters", and two sharper-tongued maidens you will never meet.
![[Oak - Oak's Rivals_13.ogg]]

#### Oak's Rivals_14
Today I am king. Unquestioned, unrivaled. A fine feeling indeed. Not much of a kingdom to speak of, but it's a start. Now, hand me those amulets so that I may reward my most resourceful of subjects.
![[Oak - Oak's Rivals_14.ogg]]

#### Oak's Rivals_15
This forest bleeds from the wounds of a pointless war, and yet here you stand, idle. Perhaps you are not the ally of action I took you for.
