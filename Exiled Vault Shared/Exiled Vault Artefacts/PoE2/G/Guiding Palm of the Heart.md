## Guiding Palm of the Heart
"When the Third Pact was written in stone, the Dreamer gave the alliance of men and
beasts knowledge. In return, they gave him a drop of blood; one from each of the
races of Wraeclast. In the centuries that followed, his Will began to subtly change."
- Book of the Benevolent Dreamer, Histories 220:5
