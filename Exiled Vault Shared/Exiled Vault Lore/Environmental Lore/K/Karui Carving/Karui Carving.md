## Karui Carving
#### Read
By command of fallen blood, leave your habitat and fill the cup of Tukohama. Cleave the heads of our enemies from shoulders unworthy, and adorn the belt of Tukohama. And to the Lord of War, I kneel, with boldness at your feet and demand to be drowned in your Valour. Let me look upon my foes without fear, drive me to kill without hesitation, and sear that sinful voice of conscience so I will not feel remorse. For this is war and you, my lord, are its father.
