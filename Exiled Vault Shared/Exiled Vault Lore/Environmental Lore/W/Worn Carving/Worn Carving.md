## Worn Carving
#### Read
Mother Matriarch, Ryslatha, white worm that corrupts the earth, long may I rest in the sweetness of your breast, and suckle deep from the teat of your nurturing juices. O' Mighty mother, for yours is an unstoppable fecundity, it is power and fertility. I would straddle the walls of your fruitful womb and watch as our children disciple this decaying world. That I should lie sleeping amongst the folds of your flesh, replete, as the loving consort of your queendom come.
