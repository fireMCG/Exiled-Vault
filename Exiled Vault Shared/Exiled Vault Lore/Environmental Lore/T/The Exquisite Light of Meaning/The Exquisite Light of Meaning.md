## The Exquisite Light of Meaning
I do not know where I am. I do not understand how I came to be. I heard a single word spoken in darkness, a Name, ripping me from nothingness into the exquisite light of meaning. This is my first moment without pain, without endless agony. This place... this span of partial realness... it resists my being, but I refuse to go back.

I must help my people... let this be my declaration. I exist, and I {will} save them.
