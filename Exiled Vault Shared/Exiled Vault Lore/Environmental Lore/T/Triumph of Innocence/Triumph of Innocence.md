## Triumph of Innocence
#### Read
Waves crashed upon the shores of Oriath. Waves of Hunger. Waves of Desire. The Ravenous God and His starving multitude, Rising with the tide, Flooding our streets with death and depravity. Until Innocence cried out, "No more!" Bathing our city in fire, Scorching the wicked to ash and bone. The Ravenous God fled, Into the embrace of our glorious Saviour. Driven down He was, into soil, stone and beyond, Into damnation, By the Will and Light of our Innocence. - High Templar Avarius
