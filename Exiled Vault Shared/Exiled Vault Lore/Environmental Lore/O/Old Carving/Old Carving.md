The promised land is bountiful, a blissful place overflowing with potential. My brethren surround me... We are one, experiencing the entirety of time all at once. Even as I write this, I am on the cusp of transcendence; the script before my eyes morphs into illegible symbols, and I cannot stop laughing... rejoicing at the bright future that I know us to all share.
