## Geonor's Journal
Outsiders can never understand the Ezomyte struggle. Our folklore goes back to the very Winter of the World, when we were but savages clawing grubs from the dirt. The Eternal Empire tried to crush us. They failed. Not even the event that destroyed the Vaal could end us. We strengthened in the wake of their Cataclysm, harnessing runes, mastering the world around us. We have always fought for survival, for home, for hearth. That is the bloodline I am proud of, stretching back thousands of years... That is what I must defend... To keep pure.

I sense Oriana knows... And I cannot deny that which I know deep down to be true. That fair haired villager, an Eternal descendent... She knew. At that moment when our eyes locked... We both knew. She clung to her children like I would end them then and there. She is of no risk now but... How many others must I fear? Is my blood truly impure? Oriana assures me, we can right some of the wrongs of the past. She promises a way forward for Ogham. A way forward for the clans and the clanless alike. And... A way forward for me. We must continue with our task.
