# The Azmeri Verses, 2:10-14
For many days, the sun did hide, no hand to guide it home And icy moon hung in the sky, a queen perched on her throne. Beneath the earth, Solaris cried, her pain too great to bare. As instruments of sharpened steel caused skin and flesh to tear. In the rarest slice of rest and respite, faithful Kulric came. He cut her bonds and dressed her wounds and freed her from her pain. Rising from beneath the hills, Solaris sprang a trap. Her sister snared in flaming nets, Solaris brought her back. A vow she made, a promise struck, to repay her kin in kind. A sharpened blade, and broken luck, she'd rend her sister blind.
