## Etchings on Wood 4
#### Read
Three lunari gone now, since it all began. Perhaps I am the only one who still looks upon Lunaris, who remembers her name. Soon, I will be gone and the moon will go on, alone. My husband has returned and he hunts for me. My dead husband hunts me. Corin too, and my uncle. Corpses rise and walk and feed. My girls, they walk now... and feed. God has forsaken us. Lunaris is my witness. Tonight, I return to my family. {-Tani}
