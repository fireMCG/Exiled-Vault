# Kaom's Stronghold 1
The Eternals opened the gate and invited Kitava into this land. The Karui paid the price. Kitava cut us off from the Ancestors, raised the Remembered as His children, tortured our dreams. Kitava murdered the Karui Way. I will found a new Way, for I have been chosen. I gather my forces so that I might wage war on Kitava. I am the son of Tukohama, and I will lead the Karui back to glory.
