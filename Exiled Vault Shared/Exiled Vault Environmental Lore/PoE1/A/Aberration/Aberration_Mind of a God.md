# Aberration_Mind of a God
Belief can elevate. It can also erase. I've seen it in men... and in those who rose to godhood. There is no greater irony in all of Wraeclast than the name Innocence – a symbol of supposed purity, used to justify untold atrocities. From the time I was a child, I saw what belief in his name could do. What it {did}. Such memories do not fade. Faith, when unchallenged, becomes a force no less dangerous than any god. And the Atlas... is no different. It does not ask for worship. But it rewards devotion, in a twisted sense of the word. It remakes those who follow it – not into saints, but into zealots. I need look no further than Sirus... or my father...
