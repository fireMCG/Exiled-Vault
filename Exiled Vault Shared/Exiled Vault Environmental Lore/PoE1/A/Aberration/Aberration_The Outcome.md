# Aberration_The Outcome
I believed I had set enough safeguards in place to prevent him from following in my footsteps. More fool I, to underestimate one such as him. That he came this far – that he reached so deep into the Atlas – perhaps it was inevitable. A part of me cannot help but feel... proud. He overcame every obstacle I placed before him. But there remains one barrier he must never breach. Some truths unravel more than they reveal. Each thread he plucks in search of answers draws us nearer to disaster.
