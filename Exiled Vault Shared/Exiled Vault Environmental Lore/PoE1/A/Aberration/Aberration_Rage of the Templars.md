# Aberration_Rage of the Templars
Few can claim to have as much blood on their hands as the Templars. In their thirst for power, they cared not who they trampled – whose lives were ruined, whose families were torn apart at the seams. A handful of men, and yet they commanded thousands. Thousands willing to commit horrors in the name of 'virtue'. My own memories of the Templars are nothing short of brutal. What they did to my family... what they did to so many... And always, behind it all, the Atlas – the great unspoken prize. They saw it not as a danger, but as a weapon. A path to dominion. When power is given form, it invites those willing to twist it. The Templars did just that – and the scars remain, burned into the world... and into those of us who survived.
