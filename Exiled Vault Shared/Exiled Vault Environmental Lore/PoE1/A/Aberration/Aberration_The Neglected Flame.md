# Aberration_The Neglected Flame
Sirus and I enjoyed a simple collegial relationship, at first... it was hard not to be impressed by him. He was the finest of the Elderslayers – the brightest mind I had ever encountered. Together, we wholly dedicated ourselves to combating the growing threat within the Atlas. But as with all singular pursuits, we grew blind to the dangers around us. Too possessed by purpose to consider the cost – to ourselves, and to one another. Over time, the Atlas took hold of Sirus. His transformation was not merely of flesh, but of purpose. Twisted into something... unrecognisable. Whatever existed between us, died alongside who he once was. Perhaps it was my fault. I should have seen the signs, should have prepared him for what awaited us. I should have seen many things... now, I choose not to see. I choose not to see the decay, the distortion... the misery. What happened to Sirus must never happen again. No more will be lost. No more pain. It is why my work with the Atlas remains not only vital, but necessary.
