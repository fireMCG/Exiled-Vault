# Aberration_The Success
The odds against success were... beyond measure. And yet, somehow, it worked. I set the threads in motion across time and space, and intervened before the timeline that would have consumed him began to take shape. What he remembers - what he {believes}... is enough. He lives, untethered to the Atlas, unburdened by what came before – or after. It was the only way to save him. And perhaps, the only way to save us all.
