# Aberration_Uncle
A man came to visit today. Father called him Uncle Eramir, but I know that mother didn't have any brothers. I think Father is just trying to make me feel better, like it's not just us. But it is. It is just us now. I won't be sad, because I know Father is. I'll be sad later, when it's not just us anymore, so maybe Father won't feel so lonely.
