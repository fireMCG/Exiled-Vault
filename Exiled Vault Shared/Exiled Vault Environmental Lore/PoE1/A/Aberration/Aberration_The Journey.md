# Aberration_The Journey
There was a time I saw the Atlas as a miracle a gateway to infinite potential. How naïve I was. It is no promised land. It is none of the things I, or my father, once hoped it might be. The Atlas has become a lure for the ambitious. A tool for those who would shape reality to their will – and a trap for those who cannot see the cost. By the time they understand what it truly is, if they ever do, it's already begun to take hold. It does not consume you all at once. It wears you down. Thought by thought. Layer by layer. Until you are something else entirely. I wish I could say that I knew how to stop it. But I will find a way. I have to.
