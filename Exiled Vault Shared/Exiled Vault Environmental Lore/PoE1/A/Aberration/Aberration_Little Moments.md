# Aberration_Little Moments
Little moments... few and far between... mountains, canyons apart... twisting and shaping us, without warning, without us even being aware. For better or worse, father meant well. He meant well for all of us. He meant well for me. And I shall always admire him for it. Even now as the Atlas tries to betray our hearts, I love him. He is still my father. He is still... our Valdo.
