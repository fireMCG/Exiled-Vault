## Determination
I am beginning to understand more of this Wildwood, as a traveler called it. There is a consciousness in all things. This place dances with motes of meaning, of thought, of belief. The dust of reality, bright and many-coloured. They are beautiful, but they will impede my efforts. I must become darkness if I am to save my kind from eternal torment. I have no choice.
