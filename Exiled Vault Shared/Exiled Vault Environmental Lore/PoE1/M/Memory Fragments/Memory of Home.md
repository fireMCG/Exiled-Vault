# Memory of Home
The raids have become an almost nightly occurrence. The neighbourhood is changing. Septimus and his family have not been seen for a week, and I fear the rumours of the High Templar's secret trials and exiles may be true.

High Templar Venarius is far more puritanical than even Voll, and has been vigilantly tracking down and destroying important historical text and artifacts that he deems heretical. It seems as though he is also getting rid of those who, own such items.

He doesn't see that without history there is no progress. Or he just doesn't care. I'm not sure which is more dangerous. I can't in good conscience let important information simply vanish. I have a responsibility to my family and to the world to ensure that the boundaries of knowledge are pushed ever forward, no matter the risk.

As I left the academy this morning, bleary-eyed and sleepless, my daughter followed me again. I tucked her back in bed and kissed her goodbye. I worry about the world she will grow up in. There's a chance that I might survive living in exile, but she... She is still just a child. She needs me.

I will have to be careful.
