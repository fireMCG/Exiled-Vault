# Memory of Grief
They took my daughter... They took my daughter. They took her from my home and threatened her life. They threatened to kill her if I didn't tell them everything I knew. They meant it. I should have been more careful but I wasn't.

Four of the High Templar's personal guard escorted my daughter into my lab. They demanded to see what I have seen... I knew they would call me a heretic... I've seen what they do to 'heretics' and their families. I had to save my baby girl.

I watched them fall into dream, and I chose my moment to strike. I grabbed her hand and gripped it tight, and I threw the device into the ground, I watched it fracture into ten thousand golden pieces.

I felt a tight grip on my shoulder, and I watched the world ripple like the surface of a pond disturbed by a stone. I was being pulled into the dream! and so was she! I let her go... I had to let her go. I felt my daughter's tiny fingers slip through mine... Gone... Gone...

I saw nothingness swirling before my eyes. I saw the fabric of creation in its most primordial form. I felt the templars grip loosen and slip away. I lay there, in the emptiness between worlds, for an eternity.

Then, for the first time in my life, I truly awoke.
