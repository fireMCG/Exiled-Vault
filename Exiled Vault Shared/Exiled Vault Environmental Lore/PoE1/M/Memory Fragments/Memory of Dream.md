# Memory of Dream
Today, in the presence of the golden device, I slipped into yet more dreams.

Mountains that reached far into the clouds, with no sign of any summit. Woods, warm and dense and tangled with vines. Caverns larger than this entire city, yet so quiet you could hear a butterfly flap its wings. Unfamiliar beaches that reach into the horizon, where I took off my shoes, and I could feel the cold, wet sand, shifting between my toes.

It all seemed so real. This device is nothing short of a miracle.

I seem to be able to exert some degree of control over my dreams now. I can explore for days, wandering in these fantastical worlds with no sensation of hunger or urgency. But I worry what influence this may be having on my mind. When I tried to leave today, I could not find my shoes. Perhaps someone is playing a trick on me. Perhaps I'm playing a trick on myself.

At least my pounding headache provided ample distraction from the embarrassment, of walking home barefoot.
