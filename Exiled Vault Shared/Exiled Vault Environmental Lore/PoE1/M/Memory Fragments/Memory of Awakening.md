# Memory of Awakening
Force is met with force. Push against the earth, and the earth pushes back. But if you quiet the earth, if the earth slumbers beneath your hand, it does not resist, and you slip through. Push hard enough against the sleeping earth and you enter the emptiness between worlds. Push further into that and you fall into another world altogether.

Oriath is an island on an island in a sea whose depths know no limits, and whose every drop hides an infinite number of yet more islands. My sweet daughter lies stranded, lost in the tumultuous abyss.

That world is not for her. No world in the countless I have seen is worthy of her, worthy of being home for her, for us. We people have sprung up independently across the abyss like a blight. And like a blight, all we leave in our wake rots... decays... suffers.

If I cannot find a world where my daughter and I might be happy, I will create one. I will forge a world anew, breathe life into it, and create the paradise we deserve.

Then, I will ensure that no blight may ever sprout again.
