# Memory of Intrigue
High Templar Venarius and his inquisitors paid a visit to the academy today. Closely guarding a heavy box they brought with them. When I enquired as to its origin, I was promptly reminded that such matters were none of my business, and that my only concern would be the assembly and operation of its contents. One can only assume that it came from another 'secret' expedition to Wraeclast.

Upon examination of the contents I was bewildered. The intricate golden instruments within steer the mind towards navigation tools, yet are far more refined. Imagine something akin to a sextant... or an astrolabe, but a hundred times more intricate, more precise. Imagine scales and measurements with proportions and axis that defy logic.

Once correctly assembled I expect these pieces to form some kind of device. Though its purpose and function for now remain a mystery, whatever it is, this device is either the work of a madman, or a genius. Perhaps both.
