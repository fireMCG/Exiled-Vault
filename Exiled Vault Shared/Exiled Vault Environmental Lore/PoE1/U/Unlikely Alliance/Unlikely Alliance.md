## Unlikely Alliance
We were largely indifferent to the struggles of humanity for millennia. Their suffering has become our own, now that we have a common goal to unite us. The hostile entities that threatened to overwhelm us still lurk deep beneath the surface of our world. We must ally with mankind in order to keep them at bay.
