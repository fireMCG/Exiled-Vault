"For centuries, our people have been conducting experimental breeding programs in order to expand our empire and further our knowledge. Some may refer to it as 'playing god', but I know that the true gods smile upon us when we experiment with nature, for we are emulating their processes of creation and destruction. Our most recent creations were once considered to be mere dreams, but we made them a reality, and so we named them 'Chimerals'. The Chimerals are among our finest undertakings, for they possess immeasurable beauty and serve well as our pets. The Chimera, however, was a hideous experiment gone wrong – and yet it is still a wonder to behold; a fantastical and savage beast which can barely be contained, let alone slain. How did we achieve such mastery over nature, you ask? Through thaumaturgy; through the raw, red energy of corruption itself, which enabled us to bend genetics to our will." – Zalatl, Architect of Thaumaturgy
