# Order of the Red Thane
By the order of the Red Thane, They still resist our new master's message. Hunger does wonders for a man's faith. Raze their fields. Kill their cattle. Crush their resistance, but keep them alive. We need worship, not corpses. Bring them to Wolvenhold. Oswin will take care of the rest. Tarry not. The Wendigo watches from the shadows. If we dally, it will know.
