# Solstice Celebration
Dear mountain-born of Kriar, Another solstice is upon us. We shall be joined at the week's end by the fine hunters of Draelyn for a feast most spectacular. Ready the meat and the mead. Bring your most splendid of songs. We shall dance and sing, merry, into the longest night.. Spirit guide you always, Elder Crovan Madox
