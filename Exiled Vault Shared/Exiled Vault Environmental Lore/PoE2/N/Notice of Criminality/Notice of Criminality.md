# Notice of Criminality
I have received reports of a number of villagers hiding at the Clearfell logging site. Travel there and convey my order to return. Anyone refusing my Authority should be considered a traitor and a criminal. Deal with them as you see fit, but bring their bodies back to the Manor.
