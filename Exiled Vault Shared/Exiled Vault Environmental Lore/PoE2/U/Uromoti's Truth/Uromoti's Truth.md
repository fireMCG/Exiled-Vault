# Uromoti's Truth
My devotion. My lifetime of service. Has it really come to this? We cut our way through this remote mountain like cowardly dogs, hiding our treason from our own ruler. To merely think such a project would mean death, since it implies we doubt her leadership. I hesitate to imagine what she will do to us to my children if she finds out we actually built it. There is only one way to ensure my children live on. I must send them into the vault without me. I will finish this task, then return to Atzoatl to play my part. I was ever the good servant. Here, then, is my last accomplishment, after the Vault: this simple carving, left for history, left for any who might survive. The Queen is mad, and I hope she finds the immortality she seeks. May Yaomac deny her death's journey, so that we may finally be free of her!
