# The Cuachic Purpose
We have one task, and one task alone: to survive with our dignity in-tact. It is the dignity of the Vaal, of all those who came before. We were born in this Vault, and we will die in this Vault. We are not allowed the freedoms we read of; the freedoms we dream of. We cannot couple for love, or have children as we choose. We cannot choose our roles. We cannot wander an open world as we see fit. We must accept that our Now is not At Long Last, and we must bring stillness to the dream. As your new High Priest, alongside my sister, I will endeavour to bring calm to your minds, to bring numbness to the pains in our hearts. That is the greatest calling our Now has to offer.
