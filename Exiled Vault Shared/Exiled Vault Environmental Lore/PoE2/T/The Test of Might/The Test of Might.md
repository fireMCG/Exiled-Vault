## The Test of Might
#### The Test of Might
You are not yet a warrior, but soon, you will be! Climb these cliffs, and collect one Shrike egg. If you feel you cannot go on, turn back. You can always try again next season. We seek to build wisdom and strength, not to destroy you. A corpse does your Tribe no good. No matter what you choose to do, return with a grand tale of what you faced. Tavakai, Chieftain of the Tukohama Tribe
