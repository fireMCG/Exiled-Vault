# The Cuachic Legacy
One day soon, the Vaal will spread from this place like wildfire. The decline in detected Corruption that began twenty years ago continues at pace; soon, we will reach the threshold left for us by our great forebears. Ready yourselves! Zolin and I have long served you, crafting the blood euphorics and eradicating pain. No longer! We must be sharp-eyed and sharp-minded. After countless years, our Now is about to become At Long Last! We will be remembered as the heroes that went forth and repopulated. You may now couple and bear children as you wish. The carnal pleasures are ours once more! The Limit is lifted! The new Vaal empire begins here, Now, with us!
