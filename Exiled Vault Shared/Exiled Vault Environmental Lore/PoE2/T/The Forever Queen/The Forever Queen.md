# The Forever Queen
Our gods abandoned us long ago. Now, we live in a forsaken time... in a world gone mad. Atziri is a capricious Queen, prone to using her power to randomly punish or reward those who dare come to her attention. I once said this to her face, when I could no longer contain myself. After the words escaped me, I expected torture and... a deserved death. But to my surprise, instead, she laughed darkly, and named me her personal Architect... it was then that she knew... I was hers. What better goddess could we ask for? This is the purpose of a divine leader, to serve as a symbol of fear and adulation. Will she lift you up for your adoration? Or cast you down for your insolence? That uncertainty is the source of her power. She will shape our future around her. She is the hope of our people to stand against the ravages of time! The Empire will live on forever, a monolith, held strong as stone by the terror in our hearts!
