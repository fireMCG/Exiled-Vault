# Tattered Diary
Our mistake was holding on to hope. Even after the sky turned crimson and the sea raged, even after we cowered inside these walls and rode out the chaos, we believed the Empire would come... Not for the prisoners! But for us. We kept them all caged for weeks, as our supplies dwindled. The fish we caught were rotting and dead, yet... still moving. The rain was slick like grease, and men who touched it began to burn from the inside out, as if an unseen flame had caught within them. No ship from the Empire came. No ships passed at all. The prisoners were growing more and more restless, and were certain to become violent. We told them nothing, but they'd felt it... So... we began to feed them. We cut chunks of meat... they kept growing back... so we cut some more... and that quelled the prisoners. They had no idea what we'd done. When they learn what they've been eating... gods help us...
