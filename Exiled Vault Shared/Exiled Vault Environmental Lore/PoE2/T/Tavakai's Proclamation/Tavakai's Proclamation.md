# Tavakai's Proclamation
Let slip the chains of mercy! The era of the Mighty has begun! Let each man and woman fight to be their own Chieftain, to battle for supremacy, until only one remains. The True Ngakuramakoi will be the last to stand, and their body will become the new world. Their blood will spring forth the new Karui that will inherit Wraeclast! The End of Time has come!
