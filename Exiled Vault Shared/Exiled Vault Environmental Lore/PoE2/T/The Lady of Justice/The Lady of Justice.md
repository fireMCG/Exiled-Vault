## The Lady of Justice
#### Founding Plaque
You have been weighed and measured, and you have been found wanting. You are unworthy, but fear not, for redemption is a grace which may be earned by the willing. Until then, the Empire shall be your Father, and your Mother. 3rd Lunaro of Phreci, 1315 I.C.
