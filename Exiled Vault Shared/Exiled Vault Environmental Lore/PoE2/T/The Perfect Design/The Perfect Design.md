# The Perfect Design
Over and over... I pore over my designs constantly... I know Doryani, or his proxies, will try to stop Atziri's Ascension. Fools! I've calculated every result, every possible nuance... my perfect mechanism is not {one} design. It is a living machine, a temple construct, that can modify its internal structure to change and adapt. History will show... {I} am the greatest genius of the Vaal, not you, {old friend}...
