# Broken Canister
I will follow my orders to the letter. Do not doubt my loyalty. Deception is our life. Yet, I still believe Kulemak's forces will not attempt to steal back his divine spark during the current crisis... it would do nothing for them if the Beast is successfully regrown. We should be more honest with our allies if we are to earn their trust long-term.
