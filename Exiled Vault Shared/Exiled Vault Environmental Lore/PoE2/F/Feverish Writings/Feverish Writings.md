# Feverish Writings
My Voltaxic Canaries! How is it that you're runnin' scared of this blind beasty? It can't even bloody see! They're whispering in the dark every moment now, licking at our fear, tasting our sweat... We need more sulphite! Here we are all lying about, sick as dogs, evil closin' in around us! Get that sulphite, no matter what it takes. This green lot won't stand in our way. Not with all we've got down here... Give it time, my sweethearts, give it time... Your master, Niko
