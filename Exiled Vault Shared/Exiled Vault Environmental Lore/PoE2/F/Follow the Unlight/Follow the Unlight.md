# Follow the Unlight
Rot before us in eternal autumn... Beltimber bark. Wilt to ruin by word and curse... Of the everdark. Catch their screams and hold them close... Then still their eyes. Deliver them to us by the morn... So the Wendigo may drink them dry. Against the dead of night... The Blackwood coils forth and craves. Now you, worthy fellspring... Follow the Unlight, all your days.
