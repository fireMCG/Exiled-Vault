## Adrapheme's Bidding
#### Adrapheme's Bidding
This is a far cry from the saline depths of Tsoatha, a place which harboured boundless depth and majesty, and yet this is where we will carry out our finest work yet. Tsoatha was the domain I shared with The Brine King – may he rest forever in the depths of oblivion – but these caverns are ours to make our own! Go forth, my handmaidens, and enact the fates that wayward explorers deserve upon them; these voyagers must be punished for encroaching upon the infinite bounty of the ocean, which our kind shall have dominion over! – Adrapheme, Voice of Death
