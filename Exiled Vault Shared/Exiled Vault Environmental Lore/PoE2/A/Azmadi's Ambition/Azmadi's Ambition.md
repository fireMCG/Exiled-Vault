# Azmadi's Ambition
Too long have the Faridun bent beneath the Maraketh bootheel. We were penned to the desert's edge, called lesser, denied even the right to exist. Every revolt broke upon the same stone - no 'legitimacy,' no voice the {akharas} would heed. So I made a new covenant. Zarokh, keeper of the ages, showed me the path through the Trial of the Sekhemas - and lent me the strength to walk it. I passed. The first Faridun in history. In that moment, the lie of our illegitimacy died. When I take the mantle of {Sekhema} of {Sekhemas}, every {akhara} will be bound by oath and custom to obey me. Not just the Maraketh, not just the Faridun - all of the Vastiri. They will not dare question my rule. And with Zarokh's gift, I will unite this land beneath my banner... for all time. Azmadi, the Faridun Prince
