# Disloyalty
Once again, Doryani and I argued over the consequences of the Red Communion. I suspect him. I believe he is moving against the Queen. I would inform her and have him tortured... but the other Architects would not support me in this. I will wait until I have proof. Perhaps his intellect will triumph over his emotions. We have all worked our entire lives to make this possible. The greatest minds humanity has ever known carried us this far, and they will carry us forward. The Vaal Empire will not fall. Atziri {will} ascend, and transfigure life as we know it. This much is certain.
