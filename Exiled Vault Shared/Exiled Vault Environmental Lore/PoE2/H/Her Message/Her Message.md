# Her Message
My valiant Wulfric, You drive me forward. You give me purpose. I am but dust without you... and Him. But we must have more. My skin grows tired. My heart grows heavy. My brow wrinkles and my bosom betrays me. I must have what was promised. I must have his desire! Oswin will prepare the Scarlet Bathing. In a fountain of fatality, the lifeblood of youth shall make me whole. There you and your hound must take your renewed Pale Bride, as to please the watching Master. I cannot wait. Yours, Elswyth
