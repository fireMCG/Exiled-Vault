# His Message
My dearest Elswyth, His Voice grows clearer by the day. I can feel his presence. He thirsts so deeply for this world. I know that we shall be rewarded beyond measure upon his arrival. I am so proud. The night we committed to Him is still vivid in my mind. You gave so much, so willingly. On the cusp between he and I, you fell to and fro. Your flesh pale white against the moon. I am eternally yours. As we are His. Your Wulfric
