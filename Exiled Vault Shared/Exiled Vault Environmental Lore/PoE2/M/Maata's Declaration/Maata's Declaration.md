## Maata's Declaration
#### Maata's Declaration
Tawhoa is the Son of the Forest, and its Father. His alone is the perspective of the ages, of centuries of life, growth, death, and decay. Inner peace can only be attained by accepting that life and death are inevitable. This is something you will learn as the ages pass here, in the Halls of the Dead.
