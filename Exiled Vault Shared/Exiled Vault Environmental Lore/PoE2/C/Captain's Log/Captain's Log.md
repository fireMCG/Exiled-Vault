## Captain's Log
#### Captain's Log
She called to me! I heard her voice! How could she have gotten here, when I left her in Middengard? It sounded like she was hurt, so I turned the ship toward this island, against the protests of the crew. The weather was clear, and the sea was calm... until we struck upon shoals we couldn't see. Soon after, the crews of other marooned ships came to greet us, smiling and embracing each of us in turn. My men screamed shouts of joy, but then turned to smile and embrace others. Overwhelming fear gripped me, but I could not say why. I ran. I had seen nothing wrong, but in my heart, I knew my crew was dead. Soon, I will join them.
