## Rakiata's Declaration
#### Rakiata's Declaration
Tasalio is the Father of Water, but he does not require you to believe. He is the essence of the moment, of flowing from one second into the next. Be who you are. Be what you are. Be nothing other than this, and you will know peace. You will be here until the End of Time, but that is no wait at all if you exist only in this moment. In this Way, this Flow, you will find it pleasant here, in the Halls of the Dead.
