# Red Thane's Decree
By the order of the Red Thane, Mark the walls. Mark their doors. Mark their fate! The Wendigo beckons. We must rise to the occasion! Those that deny his Voice must pay with blood. Use it to rouse the sign of the heretical! Brandish it! Once marked, Oswin will have them. And so shall we. Lend your ear to the Voice. Drink your fill of that sweet embrace. Give yourself to the eternal night.
