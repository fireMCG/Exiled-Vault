## Word of Akoya
#### Word of Akoya
The {Ngakuramakoi} are those who truly embody our culture. If you wish to become one of us, you do not have to be Karui by blood. But you must follow the Way. Pass your test, at the Isle of Shrikes, or elsewhere. Live by our traditions. Live through strength. But most of all, do not let the Way shift or falter. Stand strong when others would seek to dominate or subvert you. This is how we will survive as a people.
