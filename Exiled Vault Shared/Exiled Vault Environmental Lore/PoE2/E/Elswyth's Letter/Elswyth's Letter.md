# Elswyth's Letter
Dear Oswin, The Red Thane and I are thrilled with your attention to detail. The Scarlet Bathing was an exquisite moment that we shall not soon forget. That you were able to acquire so many heretical younglings in such a short time... well, we cannot thank you enough. The whispers grow deeper. He sees us. He sees you. We shall know unfathomable prosperity by his grace! The Red Thane, the Pale Bride, and their loyal hound. A hound most faithful. A hound most strong. I must away, for tonight I shall dance once more. Join us to feast. Look upon me as you will. Elswyth
