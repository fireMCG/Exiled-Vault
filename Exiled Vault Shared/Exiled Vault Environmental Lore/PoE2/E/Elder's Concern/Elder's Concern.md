# Elder's Concern
The solstice draws near, but the owls bring me worrisome tidings. They speak of erratic behaviour, of whispers in the night. The Spear of Draelyn has been attacking animals for cruel sport, rather than as a necessary hunt. Her tribe push and rough each other, raging at random, only to grow eerily calm moments later. It is perhaps not concerning enough to cancel our coming celebrations, but we should be wary, and have our hunters remain vigilant. I doubt Lythara and her tribe would dare behave like that in our presence...
