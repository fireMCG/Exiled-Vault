# Karui Carvings II
On the night of the full moon, one among us vanished. When the second month passed and another of our number vanished on the full moon, concern began to arise. The statues... Karui men and women running and screaming... terrified. They are crying out, silent, unmoving, about some danger behind me. I am fearful, but when I turn, there is nothing there.
