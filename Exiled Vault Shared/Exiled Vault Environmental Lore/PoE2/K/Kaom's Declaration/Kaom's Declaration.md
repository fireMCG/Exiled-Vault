# Kaom's Declaration
Ngamahu is the mother of Fire. She lends it to us in life, but here, in death, we return it to Hinekora. We exist now to give our wisdom to our descendants, until we are all returned to the volcano. When the world is forged anew, a new line of Karui will emerge, to conquer a savage world. Until then, we linger here, in the Halls of the Dead.
