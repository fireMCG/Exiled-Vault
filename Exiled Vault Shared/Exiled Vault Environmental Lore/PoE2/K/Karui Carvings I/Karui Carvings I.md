# Karui Carvings I
We reached these shores under the first full moon. Tasalio made the sea here rich beyond measure. We slept deeply, and knew nothing of the dangers of this place. Tawhoa offered us living wood, and Valako was kind. We sang for the bounty of our new home, and to Ramako, and to the beautiful Arohongui as she watched from Lani Hua's palace in the sky. We found abandoned homes. Others lived here before us. This was a sign that we had chosen well. We didn't see the statues until much later.
