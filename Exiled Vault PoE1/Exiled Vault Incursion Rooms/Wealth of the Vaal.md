# Wealth of the Vaal
An empire's stash survives the ash.

## Properties
**Tier:** 3
**Architect:** [[Estazunti, Architect of the Vault]]

## Alva's Comments
1. Shall we make a bet exile? I bet Estazunti has flooded that room with finery and treasure by this point. An exciting thought isn't it?
2. By the gods... Exile, you're a genius.

## Chronicle of Atzoatl
In their paranoia, the Architects of Atzoatl hoarded wealth beyond any reasonable measure. - Icius Perandus, Antiquities Collection, Vaal Golden Idol
