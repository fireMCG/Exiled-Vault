## Alva's Comments
1. You've allowed Matatl to live, and as thanks he's put traps everywhere. I'm not entirely sure you've thought this through...
2. Remind me again why you let them fill this place with traps?
## Chronicle of Atzoatl
Expedition logs suggest quite a few explorers sought Atzoatl over the centuries. The Architects planned against this potential plundering, however, with ingenious and lethal traps. - Icius Perandus, Antiquities Collection, Corroded Spring Mechanism
