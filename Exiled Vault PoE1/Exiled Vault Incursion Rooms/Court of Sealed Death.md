## Alva's Comments
1. A whole room filled with dangerous strongboxes packed to the brim with treasure. You're my favourite person, Exile.
## Chronicle of Atzoatl
Zantipi is said to have spent most of his considerable talent devising ambushes that used the promise of treasure as a lure for would-be looters. - Icius Perandus, Antiquities Collection, Broken Locking Mechanism
