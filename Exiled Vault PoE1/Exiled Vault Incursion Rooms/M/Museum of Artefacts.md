# Museum of Artefacts
Heirlooms, rotten, long-forgotten.

#
## Properties
**Tier:** 3
**Architect:** [[Juatalotli, Architect of the Hoard]]
## Alva's Comments
1. With another rival dead, the Architect of the Hoard's going to fill that room with all sorts of valuables. Good thinking.
2. What a pack-rat! These relics will fetch a pretty penny back home!
## Chronicle of Atzoatl
Much could be learned from the relics said to be kept in Atzoatl. We consider the Vaal ancient, so what did they consider ancient in turn? - Icius Perandus, Antiquities Collection, Vaal Mural
