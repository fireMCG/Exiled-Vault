The Dreamer's reach extends through the breach.

## Properties
**Tier:** 3
**Architect:** [[Zilquapa, Architect of the Breach]]
## Alva's Comments
1. Great, Zilquapa's madness has given eldritch... {things}... ingress to the temple. Was that your intention, or should I applaud you for your foolhardiness?
2. From crimson blood to purple flame, this cult must be put to rest.
## Chronicle of Atzoatl
Atzoatl played host to the Cult of the Purple Flame. I do not know what powers they worshipped, but my educated guesses leave me shaken. - Icius Perandus, Antiquities Collection, Embalmed Claw
