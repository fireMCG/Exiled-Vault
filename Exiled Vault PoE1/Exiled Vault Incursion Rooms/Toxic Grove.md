## Properties
**Tier:** 3
**Architect:** [[Tacati, Architect of Toxins]]
## Alva's Comments
1. You've freed Tacati of opposition. Now he's free to fiddle with all his nasty poisons. All I'm saying is, this better not make me ill.
2. Maybe they'd not have killed so many of each other if they'd grown fruit instead.
## Chronicle of Atzoatl
The Vaal had little concern for the externalities of their engineering. The toxins produced by their manufacturing may have poisoned the entirety of Atzoatl. - Icius Perandus, Antiquities Collection, Desiccated Corpse of a Vaal Citizen
