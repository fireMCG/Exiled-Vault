# Hall of Champions
Blood spills for cheap thrills.

#
## Properties
**Tier:** 3
**Architect:** [[Ticaba, Architect of the Arena]]
## Alva's Comments
1. So you left Ticaba to reminisce in the shadow of his arena champions... Hopefully eternity will reward your actions.
2. For a relatively peaceful empire they sure made a lot of weapons.
## Chronicle of Atzoatl
At the height of their civilization, the Vaal took to ritual combat to solve all of their disputes. As a result, their surviving warriors were among the best in history. - Icius Perandus, Antiquities Collection, Rust-coated Sword
