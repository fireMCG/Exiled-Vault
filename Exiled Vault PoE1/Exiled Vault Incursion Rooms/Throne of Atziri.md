## Alva's Comments
1. Want to guess whose buttocks will grace the Throne Room you've let the Royal Architect establish?
2. How is this possible!? She should be long dead!
## Chronicle of Atzoatl
Evidence suggests that Atzoatl's influence grew great enough that Atziri herself moved her seat of power to within its walls. - Icius Perandus, Antiquities Collection, Royal Decree cast in Bronze
