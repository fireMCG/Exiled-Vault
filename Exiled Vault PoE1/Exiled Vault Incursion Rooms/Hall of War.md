# Hall of War
Death dwells in small cells.

#
## Properties
**Tier:** 3
**Architect:** [[Cholotl, Architect of the War]]
## Alva's Comments
1. You've let Cholotl turn that chamber into a sanctuary for the most war-mad Vaal out there. I hope this doesn't come back to bite us.
2. They trained an army. But why? To protect from you?
## Chronicle of Atzoatl
A great many warriors were stationed at Atzoatl, ostensibly due to repeated invasion by something referred to as 'a haunting death.' - Icius Perandus, Antiquities Collection, Carved Interment Records
