## Properties
**Tier:** 3
**Architect:** [[Uromoti, Architect of Expansion]]
## Alva's Comments
1. Uromoti's exploration is on a scale like I've never seen. What are they looking for? What could {possibly} be left to explore?
2. Madness spread. These maps, all the places on them... None of them exist!
## Chronicle of Atzoatl
In its last days, the Architects of Atzoatl became increasingly obsessed with fictional lands. Wondrous lands, by their description, but fictional. Very odd. - Icius Perandus, Antiquities Collection, Unidentified Angular Device
