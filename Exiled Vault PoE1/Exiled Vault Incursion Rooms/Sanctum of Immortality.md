# Sanctum of Immortality
Flesh rending for life unending.

## Properties
**Tier:** 3
**Architect:** [[Guatelitzi, Architect of Flesh]]

## Alva's Comments
1. Guatelitzi has really made those pools his home. Let's hope this plays out well in the present day.
2. The waters look clean enough. Couldn't pay me to drink it, though.
