# Doryani's Institute
The enlightened fall victim to Doryani's dark dictum.

## Properties
**Tier:** 3
**Architect:** [[Zalatl, Architect of Thaumaturgy]]

## Alva's Comments
1. They should call that room Zalatl's jewellery box! Imagine what their value will be today!
2. Goodness, if Chitus had ever found these... he'd have been unstoppable.

## Chronicle of Atzoatl
Doryani himself conducted gem research at Atzoatl in its final days. What brilliant discoveries were lost with that temple? - Icius Perandus, Antiquities Collection, Third Ciphered Tablet
