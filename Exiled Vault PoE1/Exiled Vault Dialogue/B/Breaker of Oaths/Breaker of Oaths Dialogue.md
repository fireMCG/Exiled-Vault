## Breaker of Oaths Dialogue
#### BreakerWildGreeting
Approach, traveler. Or don't. I don't care.
![[The Breaker of Oaths - BreakerWildGreeting.ogg]]

#### Introduction
If you have a name, do not speak it aloud. Names have power in this place. Not even I can protect you, if you foolishly give out your name here. Call things by what they are, and people by what they do. Unfortunately for me, that means I'm best described as an oathbreaker... take it or leave it. I'm not sure what to call you, though. How strange that the Sacred Wisps dance around you...
![[The Breaker of Oaths - Introduction.ogg]]

#### Teaching
Ah, you wish to walk the path of a Warlock of the Mists. I am not averse to filling the role of master, especially for an apprentice graced by Sacred Wisps. We shall see if you have the stomach for our unsavoury work.
![[The Breaker of Oaths - Teaching.ogg]]

#### BreakerBecomeWarlockFromNone
You will be the shadow the darkness fears.
![[The Breaker of Oaths - BreakerBecomeWarlockFromNone.ogg]]

#### BreakerBecomeWarlockFromWarden
The Maji are fools. You've made a wise choice.
![[The Breaker of Oaths - BreakerBecomeWarlockFromWarden.ogg]]

#### BreakerBecomeWarlockFromPrimal
Glad to see you've finally picked a side.
![[The Breaker of Oaths - BreakerBecomeWarlockFromPrimal.ogg]]

#### BreakerPurchased1
Pleasure doing... business.
![[The Breaker of Oaths - BreakerPurchased1.ogg]]

#### BreakerPurchased4
Don't ask where I got it.
![[The Breaker of Oaths - BreakerPurchased4.ogg]]

#### BreakerPurchased7
Enjoy that one.
![[The Breaker of Oaths - BreakerPurchased7.ogg]]

#### BreakerPurchased10
That one will serve you well.
![[The Breaker of Oaths - BreakerPurchased10.ogg]]

#### Return Later
You are not ready for the darker secrets of our craft. Go, learn what you can, and return to me when you are ready. Only then will I teach you further.
![[The Breaker of Oaths - Return Later.ogg]]

#### Culling the Cultists
Your first task shall be a simple culling. The King in the Mists has created a religion to ensnare travelers through the Wildwood. These unwitting travelers have become his fanatical followers, and their faith fuels his plans. Diminish that fuel by eliminating his cultists. Return to me when the bloody work is done, and we shall see about your schooling.
![[The Breaker of Oaths - Culling the Cultists.ogg]]

#### Culling the Cultists Complete
Ah, I see you have attuned yourself with Wild energies by trafficking in death, exactly as I intended. You are ready to learn more.
![[The Breaker of Oaths - Culling the Cultists Complete.ogg]]

#### Become the Darkness
It is time to expand our campaign against the King in the Mists. Key to his plans are countless ritualistic altars that he has built throughout the forest. These altars are nails hammered through three layers of meaning: your world, the Wildwood, and the void of the Nameless. It is time we bent one of those nails. I task you with finding the King in the Mists during one of his rituals. Cause as much havoc as you can. A ritual disrupted may cause far more damage than meets the eye... return to me after you enact mayhem, and I will teach you further.
![[The Breaker of Oaths - Become the Darkness.ogg]]

#### Become the Darkness Complete
Just as I predicted: when you disrupted that ritual, the energies involved burned back onto existing altars, severing his connection to several of them, and leaving them free for a new master. Yes, yes... this is a fruitful tactic... it is time I taught you darker secrets...
![[The Breaker of Oaths - Become the Darkness Complete.ogg]]

#### War for the Wildwood
You are ready, my apprentice. We must make our greatest move yet. Find the King in the Mists himself, and engage him directly. You must defeat his physical form in combat, however you see fit. It will not slay him utterly, but it will banish him for a time... and that will give me an opportunity to begin tapping into the flow of devotion from his altars. Go, complete this final task, and then I will make you a full Warlock.
![[The Breaker of Oaths - War for the Wildwood.ogg]]

#### War for the Wildwood Complete
The nectar of victory is utterly sweet, and so is the drink of devotion I am now sapping from his altars. Together, we have taken the first steps toward harnessing the Wildwood's curse for our own ends. There are no more lessons, just a sip of raw faith... yes, drink it down, savour the taste... that is the lifeblood of living souls, Sacred humors made manifest, given willingly by fools... delicious, yes? Now, you have truly become a Warlock of the Mists.
![[The Breaker of Oaths - War for the Wildwood Complete.ogg]]

#### Oathbreaker
My order spent untold centuries doing battle with the King in the Mists. Whole generations of Maji dedicated their entire lives to eroding his mysterious power. It was an impressive effort for otherwise unremarkable mortal men and women, but I have no desire to join them in futile toil. There must always be evil opposite goodness. That is inherent in the balance of this Wildwood, and perhaps of the world itself. That balance means we can never truly rid ourselves of evil. Thus, I know what I must do. I will not destroy the King in the Mists... I will replace him.
![[The Breaker of Oaths - Oathbreaker.ogg]]

#### Replacing the King
When {I} am the dark power at the heart of this forest, I will impose my own ethics on the evil within. Travelers will be granted safe passage, so long as they do not tarry. Children, especially, will have nothing to fear. The dark affliction that plagues us will remain within the borders of the Wildwood. I believe I can enforce those rules, at least. The best answer, all along, was not to aspire to heroism... but to become more ethical masters of darkness ourselves.
![[The Breaker of Oaths - Replacing the King.ogg]]

#### Ritual Altars
Allow me to describe the situation thus: a man comes upon an altar in the wild. He knows not who the altar serves, but he pays tribute to it nonetheless. It grants him a paltry gift, a trinket, nothing more. He imagines all the possibilities. He imagines wealth. Ever after, he seeks out more of these altars, and continually pays tribute to his unknown benefactor, in the vain hope that his life will change. Thus it is with all religions. The man is a devout follower, though he knows it not. His faith fuels his own gradual doom.
![[The Breaker of Oaths - Ritual Altars.ogg]]

#### Travelers
Ach, your ilk are my blessing, and my bane. I have none of my own kind with which to converse, so you keep me sane, but the vast lot of you end up as cultists for the King in the Mists. I know I should poison any travelers I meet, but then who would I have tea with?
![[The Breaker of Oaths - Travelers.ogg]]

#### The King in the Mists
He is clever. I'll give him that. He's very motivated, too, and quite ruthless. I find fault with his ethics, however. He has visited general misery upon the entire Wildwood, and thus made unnecessary enemies. I do not know his ultimate goal, only how he goes about it... and I intend to subvert his altars to my own ends.
![[The Breaker of Oaths - The King in the Mists.ogg]]

#### The Nameless
The Nameless prowl about in the curse of darkness brought by the King in the Mists. They crawled out of the endless void of nothingness from whence he came, though not necessarily alongside him. There have been others, like the Porcelain Queen, who I gather was no ally to the King in the Mists. I was raised with the fable that the Nameless served {her}, but she is gone, and now they seem quite mad with eternal grief.
![[The Breaker of Oaths - The Nameless.ogg]]

#### The Wildwood
Consider this realm my laboratory. Here, I am able to investigate deeper mysteries, from within. I am aware of the Old World, and have undertaken two journeys there. I find your people strange and literal, and your land cold, exhausting, and miserable. I quite liked snow, however. We have frost and rime during our winter, but the Wildwood hardly transforms the way your realm does under a heavy snow. Perhaps, when I replace the King in the Mists, I will bring the first real snow to this forest. That beauty may sway my people to see the pragmatism of my path.
![[The Breaker of Oaths - The Wildwood.ogg]]

#### The Realm of the Nameless
The border between the Wildwood and the realm of the Nameless does not exist. That is not to say, however, that it cannot be reached. It is {there}, if you stretch the definition of the word {there}. You cannot walk a path to find it. To enter it, is to cease to be. Even gazing upon it scalds mortal eyes, for we do not have the faculties to perceive that which is not. Everything you can possibly experience, be it good, evil, light, dark, birth, death, or anything else in the Draíocht all of it is part of our web of meaning. The realm of the Nameless is not the web. It cannot be, yet it is. This all sounds like nonsense, I'm sure, but it's the only way we can refer to things we cannot comprehend. In fact, the moment you do comprehend something from the realm of the Nameless the moment you imagine it, understand it, Name it it takes on meaning and becomes part of life's web. It ceases to {not be}. Quite literally, we can never truly understand nothingness, for if we did, it would no longer be nothing.
![[The Breaker of Oaths - The Realm of the Nameless.ogg]]

#### The Maji
I am no beast. I miss my people, and the communion with my fellow Maji. For my views, I have been outcast for many seasons, enough that I barely remember them. I hold out hope that they continue to survive deeper in the Wildwood, but neither hide nor hair of their presence has presented itself in a very long time. Here on the border 'twixt our worlds, I have only travelers for company. My long toil has cost me dearly, but I know that my way is right, and I will accomplish what the Maji never could.
![[The Breaker of Oaths - The Maji.ogg]]

#### The Draíocht
There exists a sliver of power in all living things, by definition. We walk upon a web of meaning spun with the silk of perception. That web shivers with every little shift in thought or idea. Beings like the King in the Mists and the Porcelain Queen are spiders that crawl the strands, seeking to ensnare us and drain us. The Draíocht, however, mystify me. The Sisters Three, or the original Goddess, whatever one might believe her to have been... she was selfless. Humble. She gave her essence back to the living beings from whence it came, and then some. This act may have come with profound consequences that we still do not yet understand. There is a reason I study corpses especially ancient ones. The oldest bones are fundamentally different, and I am determined to decipher their mysteries.
![[The Breaker of Oaths - The Draíocht.ogg]]

#### The Four Humors
Primal, Vivid, Wild... Sacred. There are four humors that underlie the web of life. Each comprises a precious substance our natural world requires to function. Each is also produced by the natural world, and by living beings. The cycle is self-sustaining, so long as balance is maintained.
![[The Breaker of Oaths - The Four Humors.ogg]]

#### Wild Humors
A Warlock such as myself primarily works with that which we call Wild, for it is unpredictable, but strong. A keen mind can harness Wild humors, either despite their volatility, or because of it. The most difficult lesson for an apprentice is usually the most basic: life and death ooze from the same sap. A corpse becomes a haven for budding life, which grows, then is eaten, nurturing more life, which dies... a cycle beautiful in its simplicity, unpredictability, and reliability. You might equate Wild humors with the blood of the body of nature.
![[The Breaker of Oaths - Wild Humors.ogg]]

#### Primal Humors
Primal humors flow from life's struggle for supremacy and change. When a creature's continuing line of progeny grows more suited to its habitat, or when the strong battle for dominance, you will find Primal energies present.
![[The Breaker of Oaths - Primal Humors.ogg]]

#### Vivid Humors
Vivid humors flow from the cooperation of living beings. Whereas Primal humors are derived from competition and change, Vivid humors arise when disparate creatures achieve harmony. Consider the argoleth, a small reptilian creature that rides the fur of an ape. It feeds from castoffs and enjoys greater mobility, and in return, picks off parasites and cleans the ape's fur. There it is. Vivid humors arise. Civilisation itself is a rather heavy source of Vivid energies... but we don't have much of {that} around here.
![[The Breaker of Oaths - Vivid Humors.ogg]]

#### Sacred Humors
I have yet to understand the full import of Sacred humors. They are intimately connected, somehow, with the mind and the heart. What you think, what you believe, what you long for... at some level, it is a fluid, and it flows from you in measure equal to your passions. I have come to believe that, in some sense, the Draíocht is the flow of Sacred secretions, or contains its will. The King in the Mists harvests it with his deceitful altars. I dare say the secrets of the Wildwood itself are synonymous with the true nature of Sacred humors. We will uncover all in due time.
![[The Breaker of Oaths - Sacred Humors.ogg]]

#### The Wisps
Have you guessed what they are yet, apprentice? Few think upon their presence, upon their meaning. They are far more than pretty lights dancing in the darkness. The Sacred Wisps chose you. They aid you. That alone should tell you something.
![[The Breaker of Oaths - The Wisps.ogg]]

#### The Warden of Eaves
I do not resent {her}. She holds a grudge against {me} for my betrayal of the ways of the Maji, but I am doing what I must to finally win this ancient war. When I have wrested control of the Wildwood's darkness, she will see that I am no enemy.
![[The Breaker of Oaths - The Warden of Eaves.ogg]]

#### The Primal Huntress
There is no room for bystanders in my philosophy. A pox on those who sit idly by and do nothing!
![[The Breaker of Oaths - The Primal Huntress.ogg]]

#### Strange Harvests
So, you have seen someone's attempt to harvest the four Humors directly. I have seen plots of strange and twisted plants myself. We could achieve mastery over nature {if} we learned proper control, but my science is in its infancy. We would need vast and complex machines, and the risk would be great, but the ambition is a worthy one...
![[The Breaker of Oaths - Strange Harvests.ogg]]

#### The Scourge
You have seen our intrusive demon interlopers, I take it. From whence they hail, I know not, though I am certain the Wildwood is not their goal. For travelers, it never is, and those demons are travelers like any other. The Draíocht diverts them here for reasons beyond my ken. They do try to eat everything they see and I do mean {everything} but careless consumption in the Wildwood is a mistake that none live to repeat.
![[The Breaker of Oaths - The Scourge.ogg]]

#### Formal Greeting
You have impressed me beyond measure, and, perhaps, surpassed me in some ways. I think I can trust you with my True Name. I am called Dromion Ley, and it has been a pleasure teaching you.
