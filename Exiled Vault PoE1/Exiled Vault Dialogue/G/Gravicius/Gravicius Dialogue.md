## Gravicius Dialogue
#### GraviciusIntro1
I shall purify you in flame, whore of nightmare!
![[Gravicius - GraviciusIntro1.ogg]]

#### GraviciusIntro2
You've forgotten your place, Karui slave. Let me remind you.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusIntro2.ogg]]

#### GraviciusIntro3
You're God's greatest disappointment, heretic!
![[Gravicius - GraviciusIntro3.ogg]]

#### GraviciusIntro4
You're not the only one who wields death as a weapon, boy!
![[Gravicius - GraviciusIntro4.ogg]]

#### GraviciusIntro7
God gave this world to Man, not to you, little girl!
![[Gravicius - GraviciusIntro7.ogg]]

#### GraviciusIntro6
Give up the fight, Duelist! Your soul was lost long ago!
![[Gravicius - GraviciusIntro6.ogg]]

#### GraviciusDeathRandom
I fought for God. Who do you fight for, exile?
![[Gravicius - GraviciusDeathRandom.ogg]]

#### GraviciusDeath3
My place is at God's side. Where will your journey end, exile?
![[Gravicius - GraviciusDeath3.ogg]]

#### The Game
There is no turning back now. The Trial has begun, and death waits for no one. Descend into the depths and conquer the demons within, and your valiant efforts will be immortalised in the hearts and minds of our patrons. But only the worthy will return alive and triumphant. God be with you, brave challenger.

#### GraviciusDescent2Aggro
Incurable fool! You will not be the one to complete this Trial!

#### GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightZero
I serve a new God now, Exile.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightZero.ogg]]

#### GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightOne
Man the defenses! Bring me the Exile's head!
![[Gravicius - GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightOne.ogg]]

#### GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwo
You dare desecrate these sacred grounds?
![[Gravicius - GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwo.ogg]]

#### GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThree
God tests our mettle! Protect the cargo!
![[Gravicius - GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThree.ogg]]

#### GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFour
Had you been a little earlier, you would have made a fine subject for these experiments.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFour.ogg]]

#### GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFive
God's judgement awaits you!
![[Gravicius - GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFive.ogg]]

#### GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSix
No prison can hold a true servant of God.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSix.ogg]]

#### GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSeven
Ah, the bargainer! Let steel taste blood once more.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSeven.ogg]]

#### GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEight
Perhaps we'll politick again, Exile, if you survive!
![[Gravicius - GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEight.ogg]]

#### GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightNine
A true servant of God can never be defeated. Your efforts are futile.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightNine.ogg]]

#### GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTen
I slew you, yet you return! I wonder how many times I'll get to kill you?
![[Gravicius - GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTen.ogg]]

#### GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEleven
God's might is granted to a chosen few. Witness!
![[Gravicius - GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEleven.ogg]]

#### GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwelve
My legions are immortal.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwelve.ogg]]

#### GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThirteen
I will crush you!
![[Gravicius - GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThirteen.ogg]]

#### GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFourteen
Charge into the fray!
![[Gravicius - GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFourteen.ogg]]

#### GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFifteen
I shall purify you in the flame of God's wrath!
![[Gravicius - GraviciusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFifteen.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSafehouseLeaderIntroZero
You dare foul this sanctuary? To the death!
![[Gravicius - GraviciusSafehouseLeaderIntroZero.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero
These grounds will not be defiled!
![[Gravicius - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne
Do your work. Protect the cargo!
![[Gravicius - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo
The work of the chosen must not be delayed.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree
God's judgement is swift and final.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour
Worry not Exile, your doom is certain!
![[Gravicius - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive
Time for me to clean up yet another of your messes, Karui.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix
The crusade never ends, brother. Allow me to aid you.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven
Protect the noble bloodline!
![[Gravicius - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight
Cameria, remember your lessons.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine
My new God appreciates your cruelty. I offer aid.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTen
Time for me to clean up yet another of your messes.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTen.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalEleven
This sanctuary will not fall as long as I remain standing.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalEleven.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwelve
Walls under the command of a fool are no more than sand shaped by a child.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwelve.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirteen
If the Syndicate wanted this cargo stolen, they certainly chose their defender well.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirteen.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalFourteen
The best way to take down multiple enemies is to strike when they are fighting each other!
![[Gravicius - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalFourteen.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalFifteen
This victory shall be mine.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalFifteen.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalSixteen
I shall put you in your place, Karui.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalSixteen.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeventeen
Can you feel God's disappointment in you, heretic?
![[Gravicius - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeventeen.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalEighteen
This world was made to be bent to Man's will. As were you, little girl!
![[Gravicius - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalEighteen.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalNineteen
You think death is your weapon alone, boy, but you are dearly mistaken.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalNineteen.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwenty
I wish you had listened, Cameria.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwenty.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyOne
You've had your chance. Now a real leader must step in.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyOne.ogg]]

#### GraviciusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero
Luckily I have the skill to destroy all comers!
![[Gravicius - GraviciusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero.ogg]]

#### GraviciusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne
This cargo will not be yours, traitor!
![[Gravicius - GraviciusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne.ogg]]

#### GraviciusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo
Careful, traitor, lest you end up a test subject at our next lab.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo.ogg]]

#### GraviciusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree
Just more souls to deliver to God!
![[Gravicius - GraviciusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree.ogg]]

#### GraviciusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour
I think not.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour.ogg]]

#### GraviciusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive
God becomes what we want him to be, and thus we can do no wrong in his name.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive.ogg]]

#### GraviciusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix
Mercy is not in me, assassin. Neither given, nor receivable.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix.ogg]]

#### GraviciusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven
I know full well the golden blood of your line of traitors!
![[Gravicius - GraviciusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven.ogg]]

#### GraviciusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight
Sentari was a fool. If I had been there, the Ezomytes would have been cut down to the last man.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight.ogg]]

#### GraviciusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine
Disappointing, but not unexpected. Let my final lesson begin!
![[Gravicius - GraviciusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine.ogg]]

#### GraviciusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalTen
Be quiet.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalTen.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyTwo
Now we cannot fail!
![[Gravicius - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyTwo.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyThree
This cargo will not be yours, Exile!
![[Gravicius - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyThree.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFour
You'll never succeed now, Exile.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFour.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFive
You are doomed now, Exile!
![[Gravicius - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFive.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySix
And so you find yourself in your destined role, Karui: under my command!
![[Gravicius - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySix.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySeven
God promised immortality, Elreon, but the Eternal One delivered. This is my crusade now.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySeven.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyEight
You were born a weapon, Hillock, and I will wield you on behalf of the Syndicate.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyEight.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyNine
It is good that you believe 'might makes right,' Thane. That means we agree I should be in charge here.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyNine.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirty
Bend your carving to the will of warfare, Aisling.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirty.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirtyOne
This is my crusade to lead now.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirtyOne.ogg]]

#### GraviciusKillPlayerZero
You will never achieve victory fighting only for yourself.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusKillPlayerZero.ogg]]

#### GraviciusKillPlayerOne
Secure the cargo, and make sure that one is fully dead.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusKillPlayerOne.ogg]]

#### GraviciusKillPlayerTwo
Pile this carcass with the others.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusKillPlayerTwo.ogg]]

#### GraviciusKillPlayerThree
You brought this on yourself.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusKillPlayerThree.ogg]]

#### GraviciusEscapeZero
God's plan continues apace. Until next time, Exile.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusEscapeZero.ogg]]

#### GraviciusEscapeOne
There shall be no prize for you this day.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusEscapeOne.ogg]]

#### GraviciusEscapeTwo
A pity, Exile. You were so close.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusEscapeTwo.ogg]]

#### GraviciusDefeatedZero
Is no defense enough?
![[Gravicius - GraviciusDefeatedZero.ogg]]

#### GraviciusDefeatedOne
You brute!
![[Gravicius - GraviciusDefeatedOne.ogg]]

#### GraviciusDefeatedTwo
You are no thing of God!
![[Gravicius - GraviciusDefeatedTwo.ogg]]

#### GraviciusDefeatedThree
How is this possible?
![[Gravicius - GraviciusDefeatedThree.ogg]]

#### GraviciusDefeatedFour
The flesh can be bound and shackled, but faith will persevere in the end.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusDefeatedFour.ogg]]

#### GraviciusDefeatedFive
More deals, Exile?
![[Gravicius - GraviciusDefeatedFive.ogg]]

#### GraviciusDefeatedSix
Wait, wait!
![[Gravicius - GraviciusDefeatedSix.ogg]]

#### GraviciusDefeatedSeven
I shall die a thousand times if needed!
![[Gravicius - GraviciusDefeatedSeven.ogg]]

#### GraviciusDefeatedEight
Turnabout is fair play.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusDefeatedEight.ogg]]

#### GraviciusDefeatedNine
I don't have to win every battle to win the war.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusDefeatedNine.ogg]]

#### GraviciusDefeatedTen
Just a small misstep on the inevitable path to salvation.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusDefeatedTen.ogg]]

#### GraviciusOfferBargainZero
You've made your show of force, savage. I submit, and entreat you to bargain in exchange for my life.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusOfferBargainZero.ogg]]

#### GraviciusOfferBargainOne
You are clearly superior. I admit defeat. Perhaps you would wrest from me a political reward? I'll bring on a fellow Syndicate member to this job at your behest. Perhaps someone weak, and easily exploitable.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusOfferBargainOne.ogg]]

#### GraviciusOfferBargainTwo
I care not who I deceive in the pursuit of my goal. The Syndicate is full of Godless heretics seeking to evade eternal judgement.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusOfferBargainTwo.ogg]]

#### GraviciusOfferBargainThree
Ah, I see your plans, Exile. You want to reorganize the Syndicate for your own reasons. Perhaps our goals align? I wish to stay alive for the moment, and you - what do you want?
![[Gravicius - GraviciusOfferBargainThree.ogg]]

#### GraviciusOfferBargainFour
I've been blind to the Syndicate's heresy for far too long. I am done with it. My only escape from the Eternal One is to remain alive. If you kill me, I'll just rise again, deeper in the Syndicate's clutches.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusOfferBargainFour.ogg]]

#### GraviciusOfferBargainFive
Strategic knowledge is the key to warfare. Spare me this time and I'll tell you what I know.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusOfferBargainFive.ogg]]

#### GraviciusOfferBargainSix
I prefer not to rely overmuch on the Eternal One's resurrection. Debts quickly become chains. Would you accept material reward in exchange for sparing me?
![[Gravicius - GraviciusOfferBargainSix.ogg]]

#### GraviciusBargainAcceptedZero
That serves my plans quite well.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusBargainAcceptedZero.ogg]]

#### GraviciusBargainAcceptedOne
One heathen is as good as another.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusBargainAcceptedOne.ogg]]

#### GraviciusBargainAcceptedTwo
You are a wonderful pawn, Exile.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusBargainAcceptedTwo.ogg]]

#### GraviciusBargainAcceptedThree
Solitary prayer shall guide me, in time.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusBargainAcceptedThree.ogg]]

#### GraviciusBargainAcceptedFour
Now you know what I wish you to know.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusBargainAcceptedFour.ogg]]

#### GraviciusBargainAcceptedFive
Drive the Syndicate into a corner and enrage it.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusBargainAcceptedFive.ogg]]

#### GraviciusOfferBetrayalZero
I always make sure to keep watch for an advantage over my superior officers. I know something that the Eternal One would very much like to hear about...
![[Gravicius - GraviciusOfferBetrayalZero.ogg]]

#### GraviciusOfferBetrayalOne
You could kill me here and now, or I could spread certain rumors that would undermine the positions of my fellows.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusOfferBetrayalOne.ogg]]

#### GraviciusOfferBetrayalTwo
I don't see God after death, Exile. Not when the Eternal One brings me back. I'd prefer not to die if it can be avoided, and I have the political clout to lie to my superiors and get one of my fellows here excommunicated from the Syndicate. Care to make a deal?
![[Gravicius - GraviciusOfferBetrayalTwo.ogg]]

#### GraviciusOfferBetrayalThree
I can't afford to die right now. I can offer knowledge in exchange. I will tell you everything I know about my fellows.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusOfferBetrayalThree.ogg]]

#### GraviciusOfferBetrayalFour
It is in my power to ruin another if you'll let me live, and I have no qualms over the fate of a Karui.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusOfferBetrayalFour.ogg]]

#### GraviciusOfferBetrayalFive
I have reason to doubt Elreon's faith, and I have long worked to gather leverage over him. Let me live, and I shall show you.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusOfferBetrayalFive.ogg]]

#### GraviciusOfferBetrayalSix
That pathetic excuse for a man is not worthy of the Perandus name. You and I must betray him before he turns on us.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusOfferBetrayalSix.ogg]]

#### GraviciusOfferBetrayalSeven
That thing is no creation of God, Man, or Beast. Let me live, and we can both work against it.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusOfferBetrayalSeven.ogg]]

#### GraviciusOfferBetrayalEight
You would do wise not to kill me. Cameria is just like me, but without refinement. He is a greater threat. God's plan does not include the weak or the corrupt. Let me live, and I can work against them.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusOfferBetrayalEight.ogg]]

#### GraviciusOfferExecuteZero
Death holds no terror for me, Exile. It is you who should fear.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusOfferExecuteZero.ogg]]

#### GraviciusOfferExecuteOne
For the Syndicate, I give my life!
![[Gravicius - GraviciusOfferExecuteOne.ogg]]

#### GraviciusOfferExecuteTwo
Stay strong, comrade. This Exile can inflict no worse than death.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusOfferExecuteTwo.ogg]]

#### GraviciusOfferExecuteThree
No more prisons. You will have to slay me.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusOfferExecuteThree.ogg]]

#### GraviciusReplyToBetrayalAcceptedZero
Traitorous scum!
![[Gravicius - GraviciusReplyToBetrayalAcceptedZero.ogg]]

#### GraviciusReplyToBetrayalAcceptedOne
I didn't think you had the nerve to risk my wrath - Haku.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusReplyToBetrayalAcceptedOne.ogg]]

#### GraviciusReplyToBetrayalAcceptedTwo
It is always a turncoat who suffers the harshest of God's punishments. I do not envy the fate that awaits you.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusReplyToBetrayalAcceptedTwo.ogg]]

#### GraviciusReplyToBetrayalAcceptedThree
Oh, Perandus, thy name is liar.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusReplyToBetrayalAcceptedThree.ogg]]

#### GraviciusReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFour
I should have expected this from an Ezomyte heretic.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFour.ogg]]

#### GraviciusReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFive
We will talk about this later.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFive.ogg]]

#### GraviciusReplyToBetrayalAcceptedSix
I will enjoy breaking you.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusReplyToBetrayalAcceptedSix.ogg]]

#### GraviciusInterrogatedZero
A true servant of God is no stranger to the Inquisition. I have nothing to hide.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusInterrogatedZero.ogg]]

#### GraviciusInterrogatedOne
I shall stand strong no matter how many times I face an Inquisition.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusInterrogatedOne.ogg]]

#### GraviciusInterrogatedTwo
No deal this time? I underestimated your resolve, Exile.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusInterrogatedTwo.ogg]]

#### GraviciusReplyToExecutionZero
Death is simply the way of this land. Get on with it, Exile.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusReplyToExecutionZero.ogg]]

#### GraviciusReplyToExecutionOne
Fool! Do not disrupt God's plan!
![[Gravicius - GraviciusReplyToExecutionOne.ogg]]

#### GraviciusReplyToExecutionTwo
I cannot claim sorrow for that fool.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusReplyToExecutionTwo.ogg]]

#### GraviciusSafehouseLeaderDefeatedZero
Bring your Inquisition, Exile. I guarantee I've personally run far worse than your darkest imagining.
![[Gravicius - GraviciusSafehouseLeaderDefeatedZero.ogg]]
