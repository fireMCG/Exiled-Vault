## Gwendolyn Dialogue
#### Out Here
I could've gone my whole life without watching snakes coil around a corpse or getting pounded into the dirt by a homicidal ape. It's enough to make a girl question her career choices. Still, treasure keeps me coming back. You can't take two steps around here without tripping over some old Vaal ruin, all tangled up in the undergrowth.

#### Oswald and Alva
They make an odd pair of colleagues, don't they? Oswald's the kind to worry about the jungle eating him, and Alva's the type to dare it to try. Perhaps that's why their partnership has been more lucrative than most - they balance each other out.

#### Treasure Hunters
Survivors, halfwits and the occasional lunatic - that's our expedition in a nutshell. Used to be, we were seasoned veterans out here. These days, if a newcomer lasts more than a week, it's a cause for celebration. Still, with the Kalguurans throwing coin around, plenty of folks are willing to risk their lives for a shot at the spoils.

#### Quadrillas
Apes are one thing, but Quadrillas? Now they're fearsome. The Vaal left these lands drowning in Corruption after their Cataclysm guess it twisted the creatures here into something unnatural. Still, I can't help but think... four arms could come in handy, wouldn't you say? No pun intended.

#### The Mighty Silverfist
You saw the Mighty Silverfist and lived to tell the tale? Few can say the same. In fact, I've half a mind to call you a liar. But if you're telling the truth, don't let it go to your head. He's ruled his part of the jungle for a long, long time. Any who wander too close tend to regret it... though not for very long.

#### The Mighty Silverfist_2
You killed him? Well... remind me not to cross you then. Should be a lot easier to move through the jungle without him around, so in that sense, you have my thanks. In another... wasn't really necessary, was it?

#### TreasureHunterGwendolyn_OpenShop_Random
You won't find these in any old market.

#### TreasureHunterGwendolyn_OpenShop_2
Rare finds, rarer prices.

#### TreasureHunterGwendolyn_OpenShop_3
I've got the goods if you've got the coin.

#### TreasureHunterGwendolyn_OpenShop_4
Another day, another treasure.

#### TreasureHunterGwendolyn_Buy_Random
Don't ask me how I got it.

#### TreasureHunterGwendolyn_Buy_2
Risked my neck for that beauty.

#### TreasureHunterGwendolyn_Buy_3
Careful with that.

#### TreasureHunterGwendolyn_Buy_4
You'll never guess where I found that.

#### TreasureHunterGwendolyn_Sell_Random
Bit of a treasure hunter yourself, I see.

#### TreasureHunterGwendolyn_Sell_2
Quite the find.

#### TreasureHunterGwendolyn_Sell_3
One man's trash...

#### TreasureHunterGwendolyn_Sell_4
I'll take that.

#### TreasureHunterGwendolyn_CloseShop_Random
Come back if you've got the coin.

#### TreasureHunterGwendolyn_CloseShop_2
Nothing catch your eye?

#### TreasureHunterGwendolyn_CloseShop_3
Off so soon?

#### TreasureHunterGwendolyn_CloseShop_4
I'll try not to take offense.

#### TreasureHunterGwendolyn_CloseShop_5
Careful - it's a jungle out there. Ha!
