## Geonor Dialogue

Sorceress... You were banished by your akhara for experimenting with the elements. Arrogance has led you here and arrogance keeps you on those gallows. Speak your piece!
![[Count Geonor - IronCountIntroSorceress.ogg]]

#### IronCountIntroWitch
Foul Witch, your very own coven cast you out for your forbidden pursuits. Your twisted necromancy ends here, at the end of a noose. Speak your last!
![[Count Geonor - IronCountIntroWitch.ogg]]
