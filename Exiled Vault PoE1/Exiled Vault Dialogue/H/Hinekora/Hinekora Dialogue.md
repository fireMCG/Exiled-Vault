## Hinekora Dialogue
#### HinekoraTalkOne
Where am I? This cannot be real... but it is. Wraeclast... I long believed this life a dream, but it seems what I just escaped was the true illusion. My family... my boys... my daughter... they weren't real? Oh, the Halls of the Dead. In this life, I could never... ah... so I gathered up the lost souls of my people, and cherished them as my own. I have so much to tell them, but the dream calls me back! I must... not go...

#### HinekoraTalkTwo
...back again... reality and dream mix together like waves in a tide pool. They called me Mother, but I was forced to abandon them... I remember now, the Imbalance... I foresaw all of this, and the plan is still in motion. We teeter on the edge of oblivion, flailing, waiting to be saved or doomed by the slightest push. The future-past calls to me... I must gaze into the abyss. Heed my words. My children, I will return to you... when the time is right...
![[Hinekora - HinekoraTalkTwo.ogg]]

#### HinekoraTalkThree
Waking is such exquisite pain... memory and prophecy are one and the same. I have so much to tell you, but I cannot remember when we are. You're not even you yet. You come to these Halls of the Dead decades early, wearing a different face, but I'm asleep. You're here now, as I awaken... and you're here decades from now, someone else all over again... all these things are true. Time is a hall of mirrors. I... see...
![[Hinekora - HinekoraTalkThree.ogg]]

#### HinekoraTalkFour
... it is a gift for you, my daughter... oh. That was just a dream... what does it mean for something to be real? If you loved, and were loved, would it matter if your world was an illusion? He knew the truth. Dominus must catch you. The Arkhon's plan to rescue his daughter will fail, but you must try anyway. They must all be present at the fulcrum of destiny, if Wraeclast... is to...
![[Hinekora - HinekoraTalkFour.ogg]]

#### HinekoraTalkFive
... back again... I must fight for every moment of lucidity. Time is shorter than you know. Cataclysms await down most paths, and those paths then turn on and {eat} each other. These things {must happen}. You must make them happen. It begins with the fulcrum of destiny, the moment on which all of existence is balanced. The King of Dreams must be allowed to escape, and though there can be only one, {two} High Templars must witness... this...
![[Hinekora - HinekoraTalkFive.ogg]]

#### HinekoraTalkSix
... for once, Chaos is not the enemy... imagine that... they see you for what you truly are, like I do... seek his servant... before that, or after that, I cannot tell... the Maraketh will test you. You will undergo three challenges, and we will be the third... you must prove yourself, or else you... won't...
![[Hinekora - HinekoraTalkSix.ogg]]

#### HinekoraTalkSeven
... listen, quickly... the messenger from the stars was once a man, but before that, he was a father. A sliver of his heart still remains, somewhere deep inside... he knows something vital, but he doesn't know that he knows... I cannot see it, for I was... never a Mother... Doryani is missing...
![[Hinekora - HinekoraTalkSeven.ogg]]

#### HinekoraTalkEight
... the Thief... I will suggest he seek counsel in the one place I can never see... upon his return, he will create the Beast... then I am sorry, my children, but I must sleep for time beyond time. The plan is in place. Make no traffic with the Vaal. The horrors of Queen Atziri must happen. On this, we agree, even with our mortal enemy...
![[Hinekora - HinekoraTalkEight.ogg]]

#### HinekoraTalkNine
...the Vaal Empire will fall. Doryani... where is Doryani? Malachai must construct his Grand Design, a crucible in which you will be forged, and thus he will be the architect of his own doom. You must... slay the Beast... when the time is right...
![[Hinekora - HinekoraTalkNine.ogg]]

#### HinekoraTalkTen
... the King of the Godless must not be allowed to find what he seeks... the Masked One must save his family before crimson touches the mountain peak... the Forger must fail in her reckless mission... just one of these three does not mean the end, but two will spell certain doom...
![[Hinekora - HinekoraTalkTen.ogg]]

#### HinekoraTalkEleven
...corruption clouds my sight once more... faithful heroes are trying to save humanity... but they don't understand... you gathered the peoples of Wraeclast, and stood united... but you failed...
![[Hinekora - HinekoraTalkEleven.ogg]]

#### HinekoraTalkTwelve
...she will know you by three different faces, as will you, her. You must find her. In her mind... lies... the key...
![[Hinekora - HinekoraTalkTwelve.ogg]]

#### HinekoraTalkThirteen
... how... are... you... here?...
![[Hinekora - HinekoraTalkThirteen.ogg]]

#### HinekoraTalkFourteen
... so... that's... how it ends... this time...
![[Hinekora - HinekoraTalkFourteen.ogg]]

#### HinekoraProphecy1
Two hungry children frolic in fire and blood, one small, one enormous. A feast ends at swordpoint. An ivory grin silently faces the oncoming storm.
![[Hinekora - HinekoraProphecy1.ogg]]

#### HinekoraProphecy2
Five brothers vie for kingship in a distant land, yet yearn to be a family once again. Two peoples, seemingly unalike, meet on common ground. The seasons are harsh, and the fruit grows purple and rotted, but a single healthy seed sprouts in a dark place.
![[Hinekora - HinekoraProphecy2.ogg]]

#### HinekoraProphecy3
Beware the gaze of the pale one. A colony of ants burrows through a wall, seeking the treasures beyond. Truth and hope are enemies.
![[Hinekora - HinekoraProphecy3.ogg]]

#### HinekoraProphecy4
Lumbering stomachs with vast mouths consume all that grows. Ignorance is a weapon sharper than any other, though it may cut its wielder just as cleanly.
![[Hinekora - HinekoraProphecy4.ogg]]

#### HinekoraProphecy5
Two enemies, born opposed, clasped hands only once. The silent wall and the raging storm oppose the endless swarm.
![[Hinekora - HinekoraProphecy5.ogg]]

#### HinekoraProphecy6
The cheerful cat is destined, not lucky. The grumpy dog is her guardian, not unlucky. The Queen always was, and always shall {Alva Valai, stop mucking about in time!}
![[Hinekora - HinekoraProphecy6.ogg]]

#### HinekoraProphecy7
A liar convinces a good man to flee. A lord ravages his own land in a desperate search for legitimacy. A noblewoman from a distant land is not who she claims to be.
![[Hinekora - HinekoraProphecy7.ogg]]

#### HinekoraProphecy8
A warrior seeks to become a goddess. The rivers flow only with sand. The sins of the parents return in search of blood.
![[Hinekora - HinekoraProphecy8.ogg]]

#### HinekoraProphecy9
A bright future lies in a dark past. The erudite thaumaturge is missing. A grand palace begins to collapse for want of a single brick.
![[Hinekora - HinekoraProphecy9.ogg]]

#### HinekoraProphecy10
A childless Mother sits beneath the sea in a palace filled with the dead. She gives endlessly of herself so that others may live, for she never truly does.
![[Hinekora - HinekoraProphecy10.ogg]]

#### HinekoraProphecy11
Warriors of many different tribes gather to save the world. Warriors of many different tribes gather to doom it. Each thinks the other is the true threat.
![[Hinekora - HinekoraProphecy11.ogg]]

#### HinekoraProphecy12
Great leaders sink into quicksand of the mind. Only a shadow can save the blind.
![[Hinekora - HinekoraProphecy12.ogg]]

#### HinekoraProphecy13
A simple sword against the weight of Time itself. The encircled princes laugh as their blood drains into the soil. The salvation of humanity will be its undoing.
![[Hinekora - HinekoraProphecy13.ogg]]

#### HinekoraProphecy14
Of fear and faith, none can know. One and the same. A new soul arrives. Pain becomes hope becomes apprehension. The hungry child would rather burn it all down.
![[Hinekora - HinekoraProphecy14.ogg]]

#### HinekoraProphecy15
The volcano is mighty and towering, but it consumes all that live in its shadow. The nightmare ends when the dreamer is awakened.
![[Hinekora - HinekoraProphecy15.ogg]]

#### HinekoraProphecy16
The harried mother seeks to pass the entire farm through a pinhole. Though it is the smallest of the animals, the tuatara protests. A river runs between a mountain and a molehill.
![[Hinekora - HinekoraProphecy16.ogg]]

#### HinekoraProphecy17
She will know you by three different faces. You will know her by three different faces. A great silence falls over a vast crowd.
![[Hinekora - HinekoraProphecy17.ogg]]

#### HinekoraProphecy18
The meddlers seek to reflect the world as it was. A court jester leads the nobles through the forest with wild tales and promises of plenty, not knowing the trail ends in a cliff.
![[Hinekora - HinekoraProphecy18.ogg]]

#### HinekoraProphecy19
A spider sits atop a throne of artifice, spinning a web across the world. Corruption begins to ooze like blood across the sea, tainting unspoiled loam.
![[Hinekora - HinekoraProphecy19.ogg]]

#### HinekoraProphecy20
A mask hides grief beyond measure. A man carrying a mountain threatens to rupture the sky.
![[Hinekora - HinekoraProphecy20.ogg]]

#### HinekoraProphecy21
A key passes hands many times, but must be recovered before the Awakener can imprison the King of Dreams. The King of Dreams will be released by the removal of a key from a lock.

Approach, and claim your reward.
