## Einhar Dialogue
#### EinharIntroductionQuest
That look in your eye... I recognise it. A survivor, just like Einhar. That is my name, exile. Einhar. In my native tongue it means 'lone fighter'. That is what Einhar was for many years. But it is dangerous now to fight alone. Too dangerous, even for the mighty Einhar. We are in the final days of this world, exile. Of that, I am sure. We survivors must unite, prepare for the end, and delay its arrival as long as we can. For that we will need supplies. Weapons. Shelter. Food. The others here do not understand me the way you do. Meet me in the Riverways, and Einhar will explain what must be done.

![[Einhar - Introduction.ogg]]

#### EinharFirstMissionStart
This land is dying. But even a rotting carcass has its uses, yes? Then it is settled. We will make rotting carcasses, and use them to produce the tools we will need to survive. But only the finest rotting carcasses will do. Einhar is not picky, but I cannot say the same for the First Ones. There are a few beasts nearby, exile. Special beasts. We will find them. We will fight them. I will catch them. You will enjoy the fruits of my labour. We will be best friends! Now, let's hunt. Together!

#### EinharFirstMissionComplete
You have shown Einhar that you are indeed a survivor, and you have given the First Ones their first gift. So now, a gift for you. I do not look like an artist, but I am an artist all the same. Look. When you catch a beast, Einhar will note it down. A little picture. Some words. When the world ends, we will need to have books. Information is needed to survive. To stave off the boredom and madness. To learn how to rebuild. You will help me fill it out, yes?
![[Einhar - EinharFirstMissionComplete.ogg]]

#### EinharOozebackBloom
Shh. Einhar has something important to tell you. You will listen carefully, yes? There are many rhoas here, but there is only one Oozeback Bloom. He is a mighty rhoa. Old. And strong. And dangerous. He reeks. He will make a fine gift for the First Ones. Find Oozeback Bloom. Weaken him. Capture him. I will take him to the Menagerie. I will find a use for his back ooze. Maybe it is explosive. Maybe it is hallucinogenic. Remember, Exile, a strong beast will escape. A weak beast may join our Menagerie.
![[Einhar - EinharOozebackBloom.ogg]]

#### EinharOozebackBloomComplete
Great job, exile! Oozeback Bloom now sits in his cage in the Menagerie. Come with me to the Menagerie. I will show you.
![[Einhar - EinharOozebackBloomComplete.ogg]]

#### EinharThirdMission
I knew you would pass this way, Exile. Einhar is smarter than he looks, yes? There are more powerful beasts nearby. The Burning Menace. A hellion like no other. I will need a special cage for this one, maybe. She is surely explosive. I hope. But there is another as well. Ungulath. Beware, survivor. It commands the very skies. These beasts make Oozeback look like Dryback. You will need special nets for these. Strong nets. Here. I have made them. Einhar is well prepared. Use these strong nets. Catch these strong beasts. Perform strong rituals. Gain strong blessings!
![[Einhar - EinharThirdMission.ogg]]

#### EinharOnBurningMenace
The menace is now mine to worry about... At least until you wish to sacrifice it. This Hellion will be waiting for you in the Menagerie. Visit it before you kill it, if you want.
![[Einhar - EinharOnBurningMenace.ogg]]

#### EinharOnUngulath
Einhar does not like the goats that walk like men. I will be glad to see this one sacrificed. So will the First Ones. It will be waiting in the Menagerie for you.
![[Einhar - EinharOnUngulath.ogg]]

#### EinharMission1
Einhar is pleased to see you again, survivor. I have tracked another beast. It is time to catch it. I will help. You are ready, yes?
![[Einhar - EinharMission1.ogg]]

#### EinharMission2
Einhar's trap is baited and the animal is close. Help me catch it. The First Ones are watching, Survivor. Show them you are ready.
![[Einhar - EinharMission2.ogg]]

#### The Menagerie
It will surprise you to learn that I am not popular. The others here are ignorant. They do not see the end coming. They are not survivors like me... Or you. Before we met, I kept beasts in the encampment. They got into the grain, then the meat. They were not as picky as Einhar about where they did their business. I learned that Rhoas do not digest Rhoa meat very well. So I moved them to a new location. The Menagerie. Far away. It is a secret place. This is where we will perform the ritual for the First Ones. I have built a Blood Altar for such a purpose. Do you wish to see it? Tell Einhar. You will be taken there.
![[Einhar - The Menagerie.ogg]]

#### EinharOnBestiary
I do not look like an artist, but I am an artist all the same. Look. When you catch a beast, Einhar will write about it. A little picture. Some words. When the world ends, we will need to have books. Information is needed to survive. To stave off the boredom and madness. To learn how to rebuild. You will help me fill it out.
![[Einhar - EinharOnBestiary.ogg]]

#### The Blood Altar
The arena just north... That is the Blood Altar. It is where you will perform the ritual of Sacrifice by Combat. Once you have captured a few beasts, go to the altar in the middle and begin the ritual! The First Ones are watching. Show them you are worthy!
![[Einhar - The Blood Altar.ogg]]

#### The Blood Altar_2
Hahaha! The crunch of bone, the splatter of blood... Is there anything as satisfying? You have proved you are a survivor, and the First Ones have rewarded you. Capture more beasts. Perform more rituals. This is what we will do, yes? The First Ones have many blessings to bestow. We will discover them. Now go, survivor. More beasts await.
![[Einhar - The Blood Altar_2.ogg]]

#### The Blood Altar_3
The end is coming, exile. Of that, I am sure. ...Just not so sure when. Maybe tomorrow? Maybe three years from now. No more than three years from now. When the end arrives, we must be ready. The First Ones will return. They will bring the survivors with them to the Great Grove. We must prove we are worthy. We must sacrifice the beasts we find at the Blood Altar. Feed the altar the blood of these beasts, and the First Ones will bless us. And, perhaps, reveal to us their secrets.
![[Einhar - The Blood Altar_3.ogg]]

#### Einhar
You want to know Einhar's past? That is Einhar's business. No one else's.
![[Einhar - Einhar.ogg]]

#### The First Ones
They were the first survivors. The First Ones showed my people that to win, you must outlast. They left this world long ago to seek other survivors, but they will return. And when they do, I will join them in the Great Grove. And you will join Einhar, yes? Yes.
![[Einhar - The First Ones.ogg]]

#### EinharOnReward
You want me to give you a reward? You misunderstand, exile. This {is} the reward. You have a beast now! That is reward enough, yes?
![[Einhar - EinharOnReward.ogg]]

#### Trading
Not all beasts were born equal, survivor. The First Ones look upon some captures and sacrifices more fondly than others. You may not even deem some beasts worthy of sacrifice! Do not worry. Einhar has imbued some Orbs with powerful blood magic. You can use these Bestiary Orbs on any beast in the Menagerie and the beast will be bound to the Orb. Then you can do whatever you want with it. Give it to a handsome man like Einhar, maybe? You cannot tell, but I am very handsome under this mask. Once a Bestiary Orb contains a beast, you can use it again to release the creature to the Menagerie. Be careful, though, it will break the Orb.
![[Einhar - Trading.ogg]]

#### EinharOnFishing
Exile, this is a beautiful catch indeed. But Einhar cannot keep this one. Krillson would kill me in my sleep. He seems so gentle, but you know what they say about still waters. They will kill you in your sleep.
![[Einhar - EinharOnFishing.ogg]]

#### Saqawal, First of the Sky
During a cold winter, Einhar camped on a mountain. I have many furs to keep me warm in the cold. ... I did not bring them. But I did have Rhoa ooze. While sipping warm ooze, Einhar had a vision. A lizard, feathered and crimson, watching from shadows of shadows. An avatar of the First Ones. A test. Saqawal, First of the Sky. In my cup, ooze swirled. Another vision, in the blood of the birds and reptiles. It is lucky I had so much to drink that night, or else this secret may have remained a secret. Find many birds and reptiles, Exile. The path to the First of the Sky is in their blood.
![[Einhar - Saqawal, First of the Sky.ogg]]

#### Farrul, First of the Plains
Years ago, Einhar was wandering the fields near Sarn in search of a worthy Survivor. I did not find one. Then I did not find water. Then I did not find shelter. This was a learning moment for Einhar. Beneath the hot sun, Einhar saw a swirl of red and white. A flash of teeth. Farrul, First of the Plains, an Avatar of the First Ones. I pursued it, and as night fell, so did I... right into a Hellion pit. I drank my fill of Hellion blood that night. That is how I learned I do not like Hellion blood. It is also how I learned that Farrul's secrets lie in the blood of hounds, cats, and others of warm blood. Go, find many, and we will find Farrul.
![[Einhar - Farrul, First of the Plains.ogg]]

#### Craiceann, First of the Deep
Einhar has many talents. You will learn. I sailed to Wraeclast alone, a risky and brave feat. You are impressed, yes? My boat was small and not well prepared for the journey. Then my ship ran aground... but there was no ground. Very confusing. Water all around, but the ship could not move. My food spoiled quickly. I am very good at fishing. I will have to show you how some time... maybe. I caught many fish. And crabs. And squid. I ate very well, but there was little water. I had booze. I threw the scraps to the sea. Then... the ship moved. Lifted. I looked aft. A crab, massive and red, stood on a lone rock, covered in my scraps. It was Craiceann, an Avatar of the First ones. Einhar knows the secret of Craiceann. It lies in the bellies of the sea creatures. Find them, and we will see Craiceann again.
![[Einhar - Craiceann, First of the Deep.ogg]]

#### Fenumus, First of the Night
Einhar is a brave explorer. The secret to my bravery? I do not think. One day I did not think as I went into a cave. It was very brave. But then I got lost. It was dark. I did not think, so I did not think to bring a torch. I walked in total darkness by touch until... a light. Then two. Then many! So many lights! I got closer and closer. The lights got brighter and brighter. Then... I slipped. I fell very far. Einhar was sure he was dead. But then I was caught... in a web. The lights moved and swirled. Insects. And in front of them was a shadow of a spider. Fenumus... An Avatar of the First Ones. Her web was strong, but Einhar's blade was stronger. I cut myself free. Into the river below. Washed to shore. A fun adventure. The path to Fenumus is in the blood of bugs. Spiders. Insects. Carrion queens. Get them, and Fenumus will follow.
![[Einhar - Fenumus, First of the Night.ogg]]

#### EinharMenagerieUnlocked
You have collected many beasts. Einhar is pleased. Now we must please the First Ones. We will go to the Menagerie. Come.
![[Einhar - EinharMenagerieUnlocked.ogg]]

#### Invite to Hideout
Exile! You are a welcome omen.
![[Einhar - Invite to Hideout.ogg]]

#### EinharWildAttentionB
We are at the end of days, exile.
![[Einhar - EinharWildAttentionB.ogg]]

#### EinharBeastCapture1
Haha! You are captured, stupid beast.
![[Einhar - EinharBeastCapture1.ogg]]

#### EinharBeastCapture2
You have been captured, beast. You will be a survivor, or you will be food.
![[Einhar - EinharBeastCapture2.ogg]]

#### EinharBeastCapture3
This one is captured. Einhar will take it.
![[Einhar - EinharBeastCapture3.ogg]]

#### EinharSpecialBeastCapture1
Great job, Exile! Einhar will take the captured beast to the Menagerie.
![[Einhar - EinharSpecialBeastCapture1.ogg]]

#### EinharSpecialBeastCapture2
The First Ones look upon this capture with pride, Exile. You hunt well.
![[Einhar - EinharSpecialBeastCapture2.ogg]]

#### EinharSpecialBeastCapture3
Survivor! You are well prepared for the end. This is a fine capture.
![[Einhar - EinharSpecialBeastCapture3.ogg]]

#### EinharBeastcraftStart1
The First Ones are watching, survivor. Don't disappoint them!
![[Einhar - EinharBeastcraftStart1.ogg]]

#### EinharBeastcraftStart2
Prove to the First Ones you are worthy, Exile!
![[Einhar - EinharBeastcraftStart2.ogg]]

#### EinharBeastcraftSuccess1
The ritual... is complete!
![[Einhar - EinharBeastcraftSuccess1.ogg]]

#### EinharBeastcraftSuccess2
You are truly a survivor!
![[Einhar - EinharBeastcraftSuccess2.ogg]]

#### EinharDismiss
You know where to find Einhar.
![[Einhar - EinharDismiss.ogg]]

#### EinharEpicPoem
Some beasts are yellow, Some beasts are red, All beasts are stupid, But useful when dead.

#### EinharArrives
I love hunting!
![[Einhar - EinharArrives.ogg]]

#### EinharArrives2
Bring the beast in my sights, exile!
![[Einhar - EinharArrives2.ogg]]

#### EinharArrives3
Ready, exile? It is time to hunt!
![[Einhar - EinharArrives3.ogg]]

#### EinharArrives4
Hunt or be hunted, exile!
![[Einhar - EinharArrives4.ogg]]

#### This Menagerie
Welcome to Einhar's menagerie, exile. This is where I keep the beasts we capture. Do not worry about their wellbeing - I do not think they will worry about yours!! Haha! A little humour for you. But seriously, exile, Einhar takes very good care of the beasts we capture. I feed them, clean them, and read them the poems I write. Then, when you are ready, we slaughter them at the blood altar, to prove to the First Ones that we are worthy of survival. That part is not so friendly to the beasts, but if you read my poetry, you may consider it an act of mercy. Hahaha! Again, humour! My poetry is great. Please, look around! Take your time! But do not feed the animals. That is Einhar's job.
![[Einhar - This Menagerie.ogg]]

#### Alva
I love Alva! She is a student of blood thaumaturgy, just like Einhar. And she is collecting things, just like Einhar. But where I collect things so that we may survive the end of the world, Alva collects things from people who did not survive the end of the world already! It is as if we are two heads on the same hound, but her head is where the butt should be!
![[Einhar - Alva.ogg]]

#### Niko
Ohhhh... Niko... I love Niko! Einhar digs around in the bellies of beasts for signs from the First Ones, and Niko digs around in the ground with a big metal spike! And he talks to the First Ones just like I do. Or... I think he does. He talks to someone! And what a voice! He is very skinny though. I am not sure he will be a survivor.
![[Einhar - Niko.ogg]]

#### Zana
Einhar loves Zana! Her hair reminds me of the inside of a Devourer, all red and stringy. She says many things that I do not understand, and marks down locations of places I have never been, even though I have been everywhere! So mysterious! Einhar loves mystery and locations. She has not seen her father in a very long time, so I try to be her father. I try to feed her meat as red as her hair. "This will keep it red and stringy!" I say, and she tells me to close my eyes while she eats it. It is so red and stringy, it must be working!
![[Einhar - Zana.ogg]]

#### BetrayalEinharAboutNavali
Oh yes, the revenant. Well... I love her. She reminds Einhar of the great, feathered Saqawal. I like to sneak up behind her as if she was Saqawal and I were Einhar, and I try to pounce like Einhar would pounce. Every time she steps out of the way and I fall on the ground like a silly Einhar! Even when I am as quiet as dead cat! How does she do it?
![[Einhar - BetrayalEinharAboutNavali.ogg]]

#### Helena
The blackguard girl? Einhar hates blackguards... but I loooooove Helena! She is great at finding places to hide. I like to try to find her and then I hide and wait for her to find me! And she never can! Always I win! ...Now that I think about it, I do not think she knows to look for me. Maybe next time I should tell her before I hide.
![[Einhar - Helena.ogg]]

#### Jun
She is so mysterious, exile. And I love mysterious! She told me all her friends disappeared, which also happened to Einhar! She thinks her friends are dead, but I don't think my friends are dead. They disappeared after I cracked open a buck's skull while we were eating and plucked out its brain. We weren't even eating venison! I don't even remember where I found the buck! That was a wonderful birthday.
![[Einhar - Jun.ogg]]

#### BetrayalEinharOriath
You killed Kitava? Einhar is proud of you, exile! You are not just a survivor, you are a saviour! But... I wish you had at least tried to capture it.
![[Einhar - BetrayalEinharOriath.ogg]]

#### BetrayalEinharInviteToHideout
Exile! Einhar has heard that you have a little hideout! I will come, and bring only my favourite animal carcasses, yes?
![[Einhar - BetrayalEinharInviteToHideout.ogg]]

#### BetrayalEinharDismissFromHideout
You want some alone time? I get it. I will go!
![[Einhar - BetrayalEinharDismissFromHideout.ogg]]

#### BetrayalEinharOnCaptureSpecial
What? Do you not have nets, exile?
![[Einhar - BetrayalEinharOnCaptureSpecial.ogg]]

#### BetrayalEinharOnCapture1
Ohhh... That was a juicy one, exile.
![[Einhar - BetrayalEinharOnCapture1.ogg]]

#### BetrayalEinharOnCapture2
Do not worry little beast! We are friends now!
![[Einhar - BetrayalEinharOnCapture2.ogg]]

#### BetrayalEinharOnCapture3
Off you go, little beast! Away!
![[Einhar - BetrayalEinharOnCapture3.ogg]]

#### BetrayalEinharOnCapture4
We will be best friends beast! Until we slaughter you!
![[Einhar - BetrayalEinharOnCapture4.ogg]]

#### BetrayalEinharMissionEndsOne
That was a great hunt, exile! Einhar will write a mighty poem about it.
![[Einhar - BetrayalEinharMissionEndsOne.ogg]]

#### BetrayalEinharMissionEndsTwo
There are no more worthy beasts nearby, so Einhar will go feed the ones we caught.
![[Einhar - BetrayalEinharMissionEndsTwo.ogg]]

#### BetrayalEinharMissionEndsThree
An exhilarating hunt, exile! Now it is time for Einhar to go do Einhar business.
![[Einhar - BetrayalEinharMissionEndsThree.ogg]]

#### BetrayalEinharMissionEndsFour
That was a hunt you will not soon forget! You're welcome! Goodbye!
![[Einhar - BetrayalEinharMissionEndsFour.ogg]]

#### Einhar's Mask
Yes, this is Einhar's mask. Great job, exile!
![[Einhar - Einhar's Mask.ogg]]

#### EinharOnEssencesContainingRogueExiles
You have seen the big crystals, yes? Once, Einhar came upon a valley with many big crystals. The deeper I went, the more there were. When I cracked open a crystal, there was no meaty filling. There was only a madman! Have you ever met a madman, Exile? Einhar invited him on a hunt, but he must not have been in a hunting mood!
![[Einhar - EinharOnEssencesContainingRogueExiles.ogg]]

#### EinharOnHarvestBeasts
There is a secret, Exile. A secret of this land. Einhar is not the one to tell it. You will have to ask my friend, if you can find her. She has a garden with many pretty colours. Before Einhar met her, I hunted her pets. The closer I hunted to her, the more there were, since they had escaped from her garden. Yes, for I know you are wondering, their meat was very juicy, Exile!
![[Einhar - EinharOnHarvestBeasts.ogg]]

#### EinharOnBeastMap
Einhar once witnessed a great migration. It was Einhar's lucky day! I gave chase to them through the plains of the desert and the depths of the jungle. I do not know where they were going, but I went deeper and deeper into the migration until none were left! Every single one made a fine catch.
![[Einhar - EinharOnBeastMap.ogg]]

#### EinharOnSacredGroveWithPremiumSeeds
Einhar has a secret friend with a garden. Or is she a friend with a secret garden, hmm? Einhar loves secrets! I will tell you exactly where this garden is so that you can meet her! When I met her, I was dripping with juicy colours from eating her pets, but she was not angry with me. I was just in time to help her sacrifice many powerful beasts that refused to be good pets! Then I ate them, too.
![[Einhar - EinharOnSacredGroveWithPremiumSeeds.ogg]]

#### Kirac
Einhar is happy to hunt. Kirac asked me to do other things, but then I went hunting, and forgot all about it! Hunting beasts requires too much concentration. Now he only asks Einhar to hunt, so I love Kirac!
![[Einhar - Kirac.ogg]]

#### The Atlas
Einhar loves new hunting grounds! These ones go on forever in every direction! A feast of beasts, one for every net I bring! Though you must be wary, Exile, for the meat... it does not taste like it should...
![[Einhar - The Atlas.ogg]]
