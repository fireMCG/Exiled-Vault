## Sebastian Dialogue
#### Out Here
This jungle isn't just alive it's teeming with things that want you dead. Boars, bugs, ants, antlions... and that's just the wildlife. Fight through all that, and you've still got the undead to contend with. Now do you see why so many have drawn their last breath here?

#### Oswald
Oswald's a seasoned leader, and I've seen him guide many an expedition. Yet, this one has claimed more lives than any other. He puts on a brave face, but I suspect he feels the weight of every loss. He arms explorers with all the wisdom he can, but survival ultimately depends on their willingness to listen.

#### The Expedition
The Vaal have captured the imaginations of archaeologists and adventurers for centuries, leaving little of their legacy untouched. It's no wonder the Kalguurans are paying so richly for what remains. As for their motives? That's a mystery I've yet to unravel.

#### Warring Tribes
We were warned about the threat of the local tribes, but witnessing their brutality firsthand is... something else. No field report can prepare you for the sight of a man being flayed alive, or the sound of sinew torn from bone. The Azak are a vicious, unrelenting horde â€“ and they train their beasts to be the same. The Orok, by contrast... not as sadistic, nor as smart. But just as lethal.
