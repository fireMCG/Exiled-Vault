## Alva Dialogue
#### BetrayalAlvaIntro
Thank the gods! You're no saint, I can see that. Though who am I to question what form divine providence comes in? I am the great Alva Valai, Reliquarian extraordinaire! A seeker of mysteries, explorer of the unknown, lover of all things that glitter - and I need your help. The lost Temple of Atzoatl; Halls lined with finery, boxes stuffed with glimmering riches and relics touched by insurmountable power! For eons lost to history... until now.

#### AlvaTemplePortalRandom
Let's begin.
![[Alva - AlvaTemplePortalRandom.ogg]]

#### AlvaTemplePortal3
Let's go.
![[Alva - AlvaTemplePortal3.ogg]]

#### AlvaTemplePortal5
Get ready.
![[Alva - AlvaTemplePortal5.ogg]]

#### AlvaTemplePortal7
Let's make history.
![[Alva - AlvaTemplePortal7.ogg]]

#### AlvaTimeLoop
We found the temple, but our job isn't done. Vaal corruption has tangled time and space, and there's much to be gained by delving deeper. We could learn vast amounts by experiencing more time cycles and seeing every possible outcome! We're back where we started, but that also means we have a fresh opportunity to forge Atzoatl exactly as we please - and reap its rewards.
![[Alva - AlvaTimeLoop.ogg]]

#### AlvaWildAttention
Just in time.
![[Alva - AlvaWildAttention.ogg]]

#### AlvaWrongCharacter
Sorry, exile. I'm busy.
![[Alva - AlvaWrongCharacter.ogg]]

#### AlvaNotifyHideout
You've found yourself a hideout! Could be a good staging ground once we've found the temple in the present-day. Let me know if you've got space for me.
![[Alva - AlvaNotifyHideout.ogg]]

#### AlvaJoinHideout
Great! I'll see you there.
![[Alva - AlvaJoinHideout.ogg]]

#### AlvaDismissHideout
Another time, perhaps?
![[Alva - AlvaDismissHideout.ogg]]

#### AlvaGeneralFailure
Something's not right. Come back later?
![[Alva - AlvaGeneralFailure.ogg]]

#### AlvaPortalRandom
It's time!
![[Alva - AlvaPortalRandom.ogg]]

#### AlvaPortal5
Time to go.
![[Alva - AlvaPortal5.ogg]]

#### AlvaIncursionCongratsRandom
Good job.
![[Alva - AlvaIncursionCongratsRandom.ogg]]

#### AlvaIncursionCongrats2
Good job, exile.
![[Alva - AlvaIncursionCongrats2.ogg]]

#### AlvaTempleArrival
No wonder it's lost. It's in the middle of the jungle! Shouldn't be too far from here though.
![[Alva - AlvaTempleArrival.ogg]]

#### AlvaTempleArrivalRepeat
Hmm... dust and rot. Smells like... treasure. We're close. Time to make history!
![[Alva - AlvaTempleArrivalRepeat.ogg]]

#### AlvaTempleEntranceArrival
At last... Atzoatl.
![[Alva - AlvaTempleEntranceArrival.ogg]]

#### AlvaBossFightRandom
Time to fight!
![[Alva - AlvaBossFightRandom.ogg]]

#### AlvaBossFight2
No risk, no reward!
![[Alva - AlvaBossFight2.ogg]]

#### AlvaBossFight3
This better be worth it!
![[Alva - AlvaBossFight3.ogg]]

#### AlvaBossFight4
You better be filled with gold!
![[Alva - AlvaBossFight4.ogg]]

#### AlvaAboutAlva
When I was young, my father gave me my first call to adventure by enlisting me in the employ of Dominus' navy. I used to love the sea. The way it smelled. The freshness of the air... but, some 'stuff' happened and I returned to Theopolis, intent on living a ladies life. Ha, it was not to be, obviously. My lust for excitement brought me to the Reliquarians - a secret society of treasure hunters, funded by those cold and greedy societal uppercrusts. I had my father pull some strings and before I knew it, I was amongst it all, raiding temples and tombs across the land. But, well... you're an exile, you know how the Templars are. Untrustworthy is one way to describe them. When I came across a manual of Vaal blood thaumaturgy, I knew I couldn't let it fall into their hands. And it never did. Though that damned High Templar knew I was keeping something secret... And so, no longer welcome amongst the nobility, here I am. Luckily there's a fortune to be made here and a few of my old clients still remain loyal to me when it comes to spending what they have inside their purses.
![[Alva - AlvaAboutAlva.ogg]]

#### AlvaAboutTemple
The lost Temple of Atzoatl is said to be the most famed in all Vaal history and myth. Best I can tell, the Temple began its construction in the final years of the Vaal Empire. The exact date of its completion has been hard to ascertain as it occurred shortly before the events which brought about the civilisation's extinction. Perhaps it is the fragility of the timeline that has made Atzoatl such a staple of Vaal mythology. Some say it was a place of darkness, home to the most vile of sacrifices. But there are others who claim the temple to be the birthplace of technology - even our own is said to pale in comparison to what was being forged within those walls. Scholars today have even suggested that it was the treasure house for Queen Atziri herself. Whichever is true, it was bound to have been fiercely protected by fanatics and royalty alike. And if something's worth protecting, well, then it's worth bloody taking!
![[Alva - AlvaAboutTemple.ogg]]

#### AlvaAboutOriath
Well, most of my market no longer exists... but, I'm an adaptable type, and there are plenty of pirates, thieves, tyrants and nutters who will pay good coin for my finds. I may just have to do a little extra legwork to find 'em.
![[Alva - AlvaAboutOriath.ogg]]

#### AlvaTempleFeature_PoisonRoomIII
Maybe they'd not have killed so many of each other if they'd grown fruit instead.
![[Alva - AlvaTempleFeature_PoisonRoomIII.ogg]]

#### AlvaTempleFeature_SacrificeRoomIII
So many dead... Let's please not end up like that.
![[Alva - AlvaTempleFeature_SacrificeRoomIII.ogg]]

#### AlvaTempleFeature_StormRoomIII
There was so much potential for good here. What a waste.
![[Alva - AlvaTempleFeature_StormRoomIII.ogg]]

#### AlvaTempleFeature_TrapRoomIII
Remind me again why you let them fill this place with traps?
![[Alva - AlvaTempleFeature_TrapRoomIII.ogg]]

#### AlvaTempleFeature_CartographyRoomIII
Madness spread. These maps, all the places on them... None of them exist!
![[Alva - AlvaTempleFeature_CartographyRoomIII.ogg]]

#### AlvaTempleFeature_QueensChambersIII
How is this possible!? She should be long dead!
![[Alva - AlvaTempleFeature_QueensChambersIII.ogg]]

#### AlvaTempleFeature_ChestsIII
What a pack-rat! These relics will fetch a pretty penny back home!
![[Alva - AlvaTempleFeature_ChestsIII.ogg]]

#### AlvaTempleFeature_CorruptionRoomIII
Ugh... Something about this place feels... wrong.
![[Alva - AlvaTempleFeature_CorruptionRoomIII.ogg]]

#### AlvaTempleFeature_ExplosivesRoomIII
I suppose they wanted to use these explosives to mine more gems.
![[Alva - AlvaTempleFeature_ExplosivesRoomIII.ogg]]

#### AlvaTempleFeature_ArmourRoomIII
You must've really shaken them, Exile. Look how much they wanted to protect themselves.
![[Alva - AlvaTempleFeature_ArmourRoomIII.ogg]]

#### AlvaTempleFeature_WeaponRoomIII
For a relatively peaceful empire they sure made a lot of weapons.
![[Alva - AlvaTempleFeature_WeaponRoomIII.ogg]]

#### AlvaTempleFeature_BreedingRoomIII
They trained an army. But why? To protect from you?
![[Alva - AlvaTempleFeature_BreedingRoomIII.ogg]]

#### AlvaTempleFeature_BreachRoomIII
From crimson blood to purple flame, this cult must be put to rest.
![[Alva - AlvaTempleFeature_BreachRoomIII.ogg]]

#### AlvaTempleFeature_GemRoomIII
Goodness, if Chitus had ever found these... he'd have been unstoppable.
![[Alva - AlvaTempleFeature_GemRoomIII.ogg]]

#### AlvaTempleFeature_CurrencyVaultIII
By the gods... Exile, you're a genius.
![[Alva - AlvaTempleFeature_CurrencyVaultIII.ogg]]

#### AlvaTempleFeature_TrinketRoomIII
I'm not one for stereotypes, but damn, I do love jewellery.
![[Alva - AlvaTempleFeature_TrinketRoomIII.ogg]]

#### AlvaTempleFeature_WorkshopIII
Colour me impressed, Exile. This is elaborate.
![[Alva - AlvaTempleFeature_WorkshopIII.ogg]]

#### AlvaTempleFeature_EmpoweringRoomIII
I just got goosebumps.
![[Alva - AlvaTempleFeature_EmpoweringRoomIII.ogg]]

#### AlvaTempleFeature_HealingRoomIII
The waters look clean enough. Couldn't pay me to drink it, though.
![[Alva - AlvaTempleFeature_HealingRoomIII.ogg]]

#### AlvaTempleFeature_BossMinionsIII
Oh gods, eggs everywhere! Why would you want this, exile!?
![[Alva - AlvaTempleFeature_BossMinionsIII.ogg]]

#### AlvaTempleFeature_BossFireIII
Whew... I'm sweating like a hog in heat.
![[Alva - AlvaTempleFeature_BossFireIII.ogg]]

#### AlvaTempleFeature_BossLightningIII
What on earth did they need this much energy for?
![[Alva - AlvaTempleFeature_BossLightningIII.ogg]]

#### AlvaTempleFeature_LegionRoomIII
Careful Exile... Something unseen still dwells here.

#### BetrayalAlvaPreSilkTown
I believe the secret of its location lies in the Vaal City which, until very recently, was submerged and completely unreachable. But with all that's going on, the city has risen from the depths, and... well, it's still completely unreachable. It seems the only way to get even close is across the river, and the only crossing is overrun with bandits. I've a plan that could make both of us unbelievably wealthy, but... perhaps one day...
![[Alva - BetrayalAlvaPreSilkTown.ogg]]

#### BetrayalAlvaTown
I believe the secret of its location lies in the Vaal City which, until very recently, was submerged and completely unreachable. It's a tale that beggars belief - some devil coated the land in darkness, but a hero banished it and raised the city from the riverbed! Then some bandits swept in, claiming invaluable artefacts and blocking the only entrance until an even mightier hero sent them packing. If they were around I'd ask them to help me achieve unfathomable wealth, but... you'll do I suppose.
![[Alva - BetrayalAlvaTown.ogg]]

#### BetrayalAlvaWild
I believe the secret of its location lies here in the Vaal City which, until very recently, was submerged and completely unreachable. It's a tale that beggars belief - some devil coated the land in darkness, but a hero banished it and raised the city from the riverbed! Then some bandits swept in, claiming invaluable artefacts and blocking the only entrance until an even mightier hero sent them packing. If they were around I'd ask them to help me achieve unfathomable wealth, but... you'll do I suppose.
![[Alva - BetrayalAlvaWild.ogg]]

#### BetrayalAlvaQuest
I've found a way to blaze a trail to the legendary Temple of Atzoatl. A spell cast upon these ancient waystones, triggered by the blood of the Vaal. I've got some in me, you see. This spell will take you into days past. Once there, keep the portal open by slitting a few deserving throats. The longer you stay, the more I learn about the location of the present day temple. Once we find it, we'll have all the time in the world to collect its many treasures. That's why we need to find the temple in the here and now. Be careful what you do while you're there, however. Any move you make ripples through time, changing things in this day and age. Well, what are you waiting for? Go make history!
![[Alva - BetrayalAlvaQuest.ogg]]

#### BetrayalAlvaTempleFoundRandom
We should be quite close, exile.
![[Alva - BetrayalAlvaTempleFoundRandom.ogg]]

#### BetrayalAlvaTempleFound3
I believe if we follow this path, it will take us where we need to be.
![[Alva - BetrayalAlvaTempleFound3.ogg]]

#### BetrayalAlvaTempleFound5
Hmm... must be around here somewhere.
![[Alva - BetrayalAlvaTempleFound5.ogg]]

#### BetrayalAlvaTempleFound8
Not far now! Lead the way, exile.
![[Alva - BetrayalAlvaTempleFound8.ogg]]

#### BetrayalAlvaAboutNiko
Niko's a bit of an... oddball... yes, but if you can put up with his quirks, he's not without his uses. The mine he so passionately guards is simply filled to the brim with glittering goodies. I've been trying to cozy up to him in the hopes that when he hits the motherlode, I'll be right there next to him.
![[Alva - BetrayalAlvaAboutNiko.ogg]]

#### BetrayalAlvaAboutEinhar
Einhar would have fit into Atziri's empire quite nicely. The man's no stranger to ritual sacrifice, though thankfully he limits his bloodletting to beasts. He doesn't seem to have much of an interest in opulence, which is great news for me. As long as Einhar sticks to what he's best at, we'll get along fine.
![[Alva - BetrayalAlvaAboutEinhar.ogg]]

#### BetrayalAlvaAboutNavali
I've not spoken to Navali about it yet, but I have to wonder how our little forays into the past affect her visions of the future. I also wonder why she isn't using that little power of hers to make us all unbelievably wealthy. Imagine all the Grand Arena matches we could bet on! I'd much rather watch some disemboweling than do the disemboweling myself, if it's all the same to her. I guess, when you really think about it, all that Vaal blood is on her conscience!
![[Alva - BetrayalAlvaAboutNavali.ogg]]

#### BetrayalAlvaAboutHelena
What a lovely woman she is. Had a few run-ins with her back in Oriath but I don't think she remembers... probably best, since I was hawking some forged heirlooms at the time, and she's got a knack for spotting forgeries. Now that I'm running an above-board operation - more or less - I'm looking forward to getting to know her.
![[Alva - BetrayalAlvaAboutHelena.ogg]]

#### BetrayalAlvaAboutZana
I've never met anyone as protective of their creations as Zana. It's not like her astrolabe thing can send us back in time... wait, can it? What does that thing do, anyway? I've seen the places it takes her. Some of them are truly horrifying! They make the Vaal look tame as kittens. Not Zana though... she's a lion with a kitten's face.
![[Alva - BetrayalAlvaAboutZana.ogg]]

#### BetrayalAlvaAboutJun
I'm trying to stay on Jun's good side. She's not aggressive or anything - not to me anyway - but I've seen her polishing daggers, staring off into the distance. That's a look I recognise from my days around some less-than-reputable treasure-hunters. A killer's look. She's out for someone's blood.
![[Alva - BetrayalAlvaAboutJun.ogg]]

#### BetrayalAlvaOrderOfTheDjinn
So Jun's people snuck about history stashing powerful artefacts, did they? Do you happen to know if any such artefacts were stashed in the Temple of Atzoatl at any point... no? Fine. Just a thought.
![[Alva - BetrayalAlvaOrderOfTheDjinn.ogg]]

#### AlvaOnRogueExilesEquippedWithUniques
I'm not the only one interested in the past. Every now and then, I run into an exile digging up history at my intended site. Sometimes, they've found something uniquely powerful, usually belonging to some ancient hero or champion. That's when I turn on the charm and make a new friend. You, on the other hand... in that situation, you should probably fight. No offence.
![[Alva - AlvaOnRogueExilesEquippedWithUniques.ogg]]

#### AlvaOnIncreasinglyDangerousShrines
Once, when I was digging through ruins in search of treasure, I came across a group of shrines. Horrific, ritualistic structures, shrouded in blood and darkness. I've seen monsters worshipping these things before, but this was different. The further I went into the ruin, the more elaborate and powerful these shrines seemed to be. If you ever see anything like that, tread carefully. The monsters there were unlike anything I've seen.
![[Alva - AlvaOnIncreasinglyDangerousShrines.ogg]]

#### AlvaOnDescendingStrongboxes
Sometimes, you don't have to go searching for treasure. Sometimes, it's laid out for you invitingly. You know what that means, don't you? It's a trap. If you ever encounter a series of strongboxes like I once did, know that somebody is definitely looking to ambush you. They're counting on your inability to resist shiny things. Can't say I blame you, though!
![[Alva - AlvaOnDescendingStrongboxes.ogg]]

#### AlvaOnStrongboxesContainingMapBosses
Treasure hunting can be a dangerous business. On my fourth excursion into the Atlas, I encountered a trapped strongbox. A typical encounter, one would think. This one, though, released a formidable foe. The ringleader of the threats in the area had hidden himself in there! That wasn't the only trap, either. After that, I knew they were not just mindless monsters. They were actually trying to outsmart me... too bad for them, I'm a reliquarian extraordinaire!
![[Alva - AlvaOnStrongboxesContainingMapBosses.ogg]]

#### AlvaOnReverseIncursion
The Vaal were endlessly clever. I use one of their secret rituals to open portals to the past. That means, long ago, they were of course experimenting with that same kind of blood magic. Sometimes, they're back there waiting for me to accidentally open the other end of their portal, and they come charging out the moment I do! That's no problem for me, since I'm distantly of Vaalish descent, but they might not treat you so kindly, since you're... I mean, you know.
![[Alva - AlvaOnReverseIncursion.ogg]]

#### AlvaOnRogueBetrayalInterventions
Not too long ago, I somehow managed to offend a powerful exile. Can you imagine that? Me, offending someone? They took it rather hard, and they had friends. They kept attacking my camp in greater and greater numbers, until eventually I was forced to abandon my dig and head home. Bullies. I'd like to see them try that with someone like you!
![[Alva - AlvaOnRogueBetrayalInterventions.ogg]]

#### AlvaOnKirac
He's got quite a commanding presence. He makes me almost believe we can actually defend Wraeclast from the horrors of the Atlas, and beyond. Thankfully, I don't have to worry about the future. All my work is focussed on the past!
![[Alva - AlvaOnKirac.ogg]]

#### AlvaZigguratIntro
[DNT] Just in time!

#### Introduction
Oh, hello. I'm Alva Valai. We can always use another pair of hands around here. Be sure to talk to Oswald as he {usually} likes to greet newcomers. In any case, welcome!
![[Alva - Introduction - 1.ogg]]
![[Alva - Introduction - 2.ogg]]

#### Quite Busy
I'm sorry, but I'm really very busy. But if you are interested in helping us find relics, Oswald can show you the ropes.
![[Alva - Quite Busy.ogg]]

#### Alva_G3_Waterways_Out_Loud
Ah yes, we've come across this before, but we can't power it...
![[Alva - Alva_G3_Waterways_Out_Loud.ogg]]

#### Powering the Mechanism
The Vaal used this device to operate the mechanisms in the canal, but we would need a special artifact to power it. From the translations I've made, I believe they were called 'Soul Cores'. I've never even seen an intact Soul Core large enough for something like this though... I suppose if you want to try and find one you could ask our guide, Servi.
![[Alva - Powering the Mechanism - 1.ogg]]
![[Alva - Powering the Mechanism - 2.ogg]]

#### Soul Cores
Death gems, blood crystals... Or more colloquially 'Soul Cores'. They were made by sacrificing living people and capturing their energies inside a crystal lattice. Some think the victims are still trapped inside, existing in eternal agony until someone drains the core's energy completely. There's no way to know that for certain, of course, but it's rather chilling to think about...
![[Alva - Soul Cores - 1.ogg]]
![[Alva - Soul Cores - 2.ogg]]
![[Alva - Soul Cores - 3.ogg]]

#### The Matlan Waterways
These waterways are a series of canals the Vaal built on the upper edge of the city. The great Matlan river didn't run quite this far south, but they diverted a portion of it for a complex irrigation system. That really allowed the city to thrive and the Vaal to flourish. Though I don't fully understand why they created a system that could flood the entire city...
![[Alva - The Matlan Waterways - 1.ogg]]
![[Alva - The Matlan Waterways - 2.ogg]]

#### Alva_G3_Machinarium_1_Out_Loud
Now this is a find! A Vaal ruin that hasn't been looted. No one from camp has managed to make it to this part of the jungle and survive... Until now!
![[Alva - Alva_G3_Machinarium_1_Out_Loud.ogg]]

#### Opening the Machinarium
This mechanism... if powered with a small Soul Core, it could open that door. There should definitely be Soul Cores somewhere around here. They had to power these constructs somehow!
![[Alva - Opening the Machinarium.ogg]]

#### Small Soul Core
Look for a red crystal a bit bigger than your fist. It should be warm to the touch... Why, you ask? That'd be the soul trapped inside.
![[Alva - Small Soul Core.ogg]]

#### The Stone Men
Near the end of their civilisation, the Vaal tried to combat a worsening labour shortage - by sacrificing their own citizens to power constructs. Designed to till the fields, mine the quarries and the like - they were quite a marvel. As it turns out, human souls don't make for a very sustainable fuel source... And so began their downward spiral. Rather silly for such an intellectual people, wouldn't you say?
![[Alva - The Stone Men - 1.ogg]]
![[Alva - The Stone Men - 2.ogg]]

#### Xyclucian
Oh, did you fight some sort of animal on the way here? Servi did tell us that the Wetlands had quite a few nasty beasts. But hey... I bet you didn't even break a sweat!
![[Alva - Xyclucian.ogg]]

#### Alva_G3_Machinarium_1_Door_Opened
Well... Consider me impressed! I'll keep investigating here for now. If you find anything interesting, I'll come to you.
![[Alva - Alva_G3_Machinarium_1_Door_Opened.ogg]]

#### Alva_G3_Machinarium_2_Out_Loud
This is the largest Soul Core I've ever seen! With this we could power the mechanism in the waterways. But it isn't charged...
![[Alva - Alva_G3_Machinarium_2_Out_Loud.ogg]]

#### The Generators
There is still latent energy residing here... From what I can gather, these lines in the stonework should lead to generators. You might need to find some more Soul Cores to spin them up, but everything looks to be in surprisingly decent condition. Maybe the constructs have been maintaining all this... In any case, let's hope it still functions. We'll then have to remove that large Soul Core from the wall of course, but that shouldn't be a problem.
![[Alva - The Generators - 1.ogg]]
![[Alva - The Generators - 2.ogg]]

#### Alva_G3_Machinarium_2_Charged_Exclamation
The Soul Core is charged! Why don't you do the honours?
![[Alva - Alva_G3_Machinarium_2_Charged_Exclamation.ogg]]

#### Alva_G3_Machinarium_2_Boss_Exclamation
Oh dear. Now we just have to remove it from the giant construct... Good luck!
![[Alva - Alva_G3_Machinarium_2_Boss_Exclamation.ogg]]

#### Large Soul Core
Wow! You did it! Now we can use that Soul Core to power the mechanisms in the waterways. Good job with that construct, by the way.
![[Alva - Large Soul Core.ogg]]

#### Introduction_2
Hello there, I'm Alva Valai. Sorry about Oswald... He can be a bit... rough with newcomers. But he's really not a bad sort. In any case, we can always use another pair of hands around here. Welcome!
![[Alva - Introduction_2 - 1.ogg]]
![[Alva - Introduction_2 - 2.ogg]]

#### The Jungle
Something tells me you're the exploring type - we've got that in common. But some places even I steer clear of... I rather enjoy being alive, you see. Still, if you're feeling adventurous, there's fortunes to be made out there in the wilds. I'm especially interested in all things related to the Vaal, for academic reasons of course... but a bit of treasure never goes amiss.
![[Alva - The Jungle - 1.ogg]]
![[Alva - The Jungle - 2.ogg]]

#### The Spillways
From my understanding, it was a failsafe. A way to make sure their creations didn't get the better of them... Or the world. The Vaal really were a very intelligent and pragmatic people, you know. At the south east edge of the city, there is a large dam. I've spent months trying to find a way to release the outer spillways... But to no avail. Those very walls are what keep the city flooded to this day.
![[Alva - The Spillways - 1.ogg]]
![[Alva - The Spillways - 2.ogg]]

#### Alva_G3_OnJiquani
This looks like the workshop of Jiquani, the Vaal Architect of Industry. He masterminded the constructs designed to help his people keep pace with their own rapid expansion. As with many of the Architects, his methods were brutal, to say the least. Countless peasants sacrificed at the altar of progress. Their screams still echo inside the soul cores themselves. Gosh... Quite grim, isn't it?
![[Alva - Alva_G3_OnJiquani - 1.ogg]]
![[Alva - Alva_G3_OnJiquani - 2.ogg]]

#### Alva_G3_Town_At_Stairs
At last, Utzaal's temple district! Untold wealth lies in wait below!
![[Alva - Alva_G3_Town_At_Stairs.ogg]]

#### Alva_G3_Town_Down_Stairs_Out_Loud
Unbroken statues! Original brickwork! The glimmer of gold! Oh, we're gonna be rich!
![[Alva - Alva_G3_Town_Down_Stairs_Out_Loud.ogg]]

#### Alva_G3_Temple_of_Sun_God_ExplanationShort
Beneath our feet is the Temple of the Sun God, Kopec. It was said to contain a grand device. I've seen writings by a fellow named Ketzuli that mention his research in this temple, but I can't quite make sense of what the device was or how it functioned. We can't use Kalguuran explosives without risking whatever's in there, so we'd have to drain the city to be able to get inside.
![[Alva - Alva_G3_Temple_of_Sun_God_ExplanationShort - 1.ogg]]
![[Alva - Alva_G3_Temple_of_Sun_God_ExplanationShort - 2.ogg]]

#### The Sealed Gate
Beyond this sealed door is the Temple of the Sun God, Kopec. I've seen writings by a fellow named Ketzuli that mention his research in this temple, but I can't quite make sense of what the device was or how it functioned. Unfortunately we can't use Kalguuran explosives without risking whatever's inside. However... there's a piece missing from the door. Knowing the Vaal, it'll be made of gold, of course! I recommend heading into the city to search for it. Try looking around the Aggorat area, as that was well known for its opulence and golden tributes, especially at the main temple's apex. Hurry back if you find it!
![[Alva - The Sealed Gate - 1.ogg]]
![[Alva - The Sealed Gate - 2.ogg]]
![[Alva - The Sealed Gate - 3.ogg]]

#### Alva_G3_Town_Bottom_Of_Stairs_Just_Quest
It seems there is a piece missing from the door... Something in the shape of a small statue. Knowing the Vaal, it'll be made of gold, of course. I suggest venturing into the city to look for it. Focus on the Aggorat area, renowned for its grandeur and golden adornments, particularly at the apex of its main temple. Hurry back if you find it!
![[Alva - Alva_G3_Town_Bottom_Of_Stairs_Just_Quest - 1.ogg]]
![[Alva - Alva_G3_Town_Bottom_Of_Stairs_Just_Quest - 2.ogg]]

#### The Device
It's hard to guess what the device inside the Temple might be. I do know that it was commissioned by Queen Atziri's Thaumaturge, Doryani himself. The project was given all the resources it needed, and the work was kept secret, even from Atziri. As best as I could translate, they claimed using it might mean 'abandoning all they had built'. They seemed to view it as a last resort, a way to save their legacy if all else failed... It's not often I detect fear in Vaal writings, but they definitely hoped they would never have to use it.
![[Alva - The Device - 1.ogg]]
![[Alva - The Device - 2.ogg]]

#### Doryani
By their final days, the Vaal were a deeply tiered empire based on brutal competition. Those at the top vied with each other through any means necessary, and Doryani was the foremost among these ambitious and amoral men. He was second only to Queen Atziri herself. Utzaal was the seat of his power, and ancient writings claim he undertook a vast array of strange projects and sordid experiments here... Some glyphs I have seen are too stomach-turning to discuss.
![[Alva - Doryani - 1.ogg]]
![[Alva - Doryani - 2.ogg]]

#### Atziri
How do I even begin to describe the last Queen of the Vaal? She left a tremendous mark on history. She was intelligent and capable enough to rule unquestioned over a bloodthirsty empire of volatile nobles, and the people adored her and feared her in equal measure. Vaal writings speak of her as the most beautiful woman of the era, but also the most dangerous. She sought eternal life, and she was willing to sacrifice {anything} to achieve it. The ruins around you are the consequence of those ambitions. Sometimes while I'm looting a temple, I remember that everything we find once belonged to a living, breathing person that probably died horribly... Sort of takes the fun out of it, doesn't it?
![[Alva - Atziri - 1.ogg]]
![[Alva - Atziri - 2.ogg]]
![[Alva - Atziri - 3.ogg]]

#### Temple of Kopec
You found it! Try placing the idol in the door... Maybe we'll get lucky!
![[Alva - Temple of Kopec.ogg]]

#### Alva_G3_Ziggurat_Opened_Exclamation
What is that strange heat? Is it possible that something has survived within after all this time?
![[Alva - Alva_G3_Ziggurat_Opened_Exclamation.ogg]]

#### Alva_G3_SunGod_Entrance
Ouch, that's hot! I'm gonna stay here for now. See if you can find a way past that heat!
![[Alva - Alva_G3_SunGod_Entrance.ogg]]

#### Alva_G3_SunGod_TimeChamber_One
This chamber gives me a very strange feeling...

These runes... I can make out a symbol for 'blood' and 'waiting'... hmm...
![[Alva - Alva_G3_SunGod_TimeChamber_Two.ogg]]

#### Alva_G3_SunGod_TimeChamber_Three
Oh wait, it's not 'a blood offering,' it's 'someone of Vaal blood'...
![[Alva - Alva_G3_SunGod_TimeChamber_Three.ogg]]

#### Alva_G3_SunGod_TimeChamber_Four
Is this a good time to mention I have a distant Vaal ancestor?! Perhaps if I...

It's activating! Stand back!

#### Alva_G3_SunGod_TimeChamber_Six
The platform! It's rising!
![[Alva - Alva_G3_SunGod_TimeChamber_Six.ogg]]

We're back in the Encampment? We were right on top of this device the entire time!
![[Alva - Alva_G3_SunGod_TimeChamber_Seven.ogg]]

#### Alva_G3_SunGod_TimeChamber_Eight
It's some sort of... gateway... how incredible!
![[Alva - Alva_G3_SunGod_TimeChamber_Eight.ogg]]

#### Alva_G3_SunGod_TimeChamber_Nine
Are these... living Vaal? In the flesh?!
![[Alva - Alva_G3_SunGod_TimeChamber_Nine.ogg]]

#### Alva_G3_SunGod_TimeChamber_Ten
Hello! My name is Alva Valai! It was I who -
![[Alva - Alva_G3_SunGod_TimeChamber_Ten.ogg]]

#### Alva_G3_SunGod_TimeChamber_Eleven
Hey!
![[Alva - Alva_G3_SunGod_TimeChamber_Eleven.ogg]]

#### Alva_G3_SunGod_TimeChamber_Twelve
What are you doing?!
![[Alva - Alva_G3_SunGod_TimeChamber_Twelve.ogg]]

#### Alva_G3_SunGod_TimeChamber_Thirteen
Don't touch me!
![[Alva - Alva_G3_SunGod_TimeChamber_Thirteen.ogg]]

#### Alva_G3_Doryani_ConversationOne
It's been a lot longer than that.
![[Alva - Alva_G3_Doryani_ConversationOne.ogg]]

#### Alva_G3_Doryani_ConversationTwo
It's been nearly two thousand years since the Cataclysm.
![[Alva - Alva_G3_Doryani_ConversationTwo.ogg]]

#### Alva_G3_Doryani_ConversationThree
History recorded the number of survivors who made it to the Azmeri in the mountains... three thousand, one hundred, and twenty-six.
![[Alva - Alva_G3_Doryani_ConversationThree.ogg]]

#### Alva_G3_Doryani_ConversationFour
Release me, and we can talk about this. We'll figure something out.
![[Alva - Alva_G3_Doryani_ConversationFour.ogg]]

#### Alva_G3_Sanctum_one
You're here! There is so much you need to understand!
![[Alva - Alva_G3_Sanctum_one.ogg]]

#### Alva_G3_Sanctum_two
Stop it! Why are you fighting?! You both want the same thing!
![[Alva - Alva_G3_Sanctum_two.ogg]]

#### Alva_G3_Sanctum_three
Thanks for the rescue, but you two need to talk!
![[Alva - Alva_G3_Sanctum_three.ogg]]

#### Alva_G3_Sanctum_four
You really need to speak with Doryani. I think you both want the same thing: to prevent a Cataclysm.
![[Alva - Alva_G3_Sanctum_four.ogg]]

#### Alva_G3_MidFightDoryani
You {know} why we're here! It happened! It cannot be stopped!
![[Alva - Alva_G3_MidFightDoryani.ogg]]

#### Kingsmarch
Well... That was quite the adventure. I'll take you to Kingsmarch so you can charter a ship and search for the weapon that Doryani spoke of. We can leave whenever you're ready, just let me know.
![[Alva - Kingsmarch.ogg]]

#### Travel to Kingsmarch
It's a long overland journey to Kingsmarch, but there shouldn't be too much danger once we leave the jungle. The Kalguurans keep the road reasonably secure. Shall we?
![[Alva - Travel to Kingsmarch.ogg]]

#### Doryani_2
That man is a mystery. Though it appears he is on your side for now, you mustn't forget who he is and all he has done... There is something eerily cold and calculating about him. I believe he will aid you so long as your goals align with his. The moment they do not... I'm just saying, don't turn your back on him.
![[Alva - Doryani_2 - 1.ogg]]
![[Alva - Doryani_2 - 2.ogg]]

#### Ziggurat Encampment
This little excursion here represents my lifelong ambition. It's not just about finding treasure. I want to build an entire archaeological society someday! Wraeclast has countless layers of history buried beneath it, and I aim to uncover every last bit. I intend to call my group 'the Reliquarians.' A bit ostentatious, but the best things should be! A shame I couldn't have founded it a few decades ago, back when my birthplace Oriath was still a thriving city. Thanks to the Templars, relics from a dozen different cultures found their way to that little island over the centuries and are now all lost thanks to the disasters that happened there...
![[Alva - Ziggurat Encampment - 1.ogg]]
![[Alva - Ziggurat Encampment - 2.ogg]]
![[Alva - Ziggurat Encampment - 3.ogg]]

#### Oswald
Oswald's a grim sort, isn't he? He's always 'injury this, death that'. Personally, I've never been hurt while treasure hunting. I actually find it rather easy! He always makes sure we have the proper supplies, and checks his lists for everything four or five times before we make a move. He also invented what I call the Oswald technique. On the rare occasions he personally goes out with us, he throws a rock at absolutely everything before touching it. Every flagstone, every pillar, every statue... You'd be positively amazed at the elaborate traps he sets off, even in places I've walked through already!
![[Alva - Oswald - 1.ogg]]
![[Alva - Oswald - 2.ogg]]
![[Alva - Oswald - 3.ogg]]

#### Servi
Servi has been a fantastic ally to us here. Her people have lived in the vicinity of Utzaal for countless generations, so she's been able to show us all the most interesting Vaal ruins. The accessible ruins were all looted long ago, of course, but the lake around us has protected most of the city since the end of the Vaal empire...
![[Alva - Servi - 1.ogg]]
![[Alva - Servi - 2.ogg]]

#### The Hooded One
That hooded fellow over there... He's a friend of yours, I take it? Seems to be one of few words. Oh well. I'm not one to judge the company you choose to keep. Oswald's going to lose his wits if any more of you show up though!
![[Alva - The Hooded One - 1.ogg]]
![[Alva - The Hooded One - 2.ogg]]

#### The Search
So you're looking for a device the Vaal intended to use against the Cataclysm? Ah, so that's why you came here. Well... You're on the right trail. The Ziggurat on which we stand was rumored to contain a device to save their people. If you want to explore it, you'll have to find a way to drain the city first.
![[Alva - The Search - 1.ogg]]
![[Alva - The Search - 2.ogg]]

#### Alva_G3_Gossip_Doryani
History says Doryani disappeared just before the Cataclysm. Now we know why he came with us to the present. It seems the choice has already been made.
![[Alva - Alva_G3_Gossip_Doryani.ogg]]

#### The Beast
I've heard of the Beast. Everyone has. If someone is truly trying to raise another, then they must be the grandest of fools. These very ruins around us are the result of an attempt to control such a thing. This is the only way it can end.
![[Alva - The Beast.ogg]]

#### Trapped in the Temple
The Vaal in this pyramid must have been trapped here since the Cataclysm. Was it Corruption that kept them alive? Or the energy from their sun? I can't imagine a worse fate...
![[Alva - Trapped in the Temple.ogg]]

#### The Sun
That sun is an incredible achievement, no doubt, but it doesn't fit with what the Vaal wrote about this place. Perhaps it powers the device we seek...
![[Alva - The Sun.ogg]]

#### Alva_G3_Utzaal_Approach_Viper_Out_Loud
Don't worry, I can solve this. This is all just a misunderstanding!
![[Alva - Alva_G3_Utzaal_Approach_Viper_Out_Loud.ogg]]

#### Alva_G3_Utzaal_Reply_To_Viper_Out_Loud
Why, that was me, of course! I am Alva Valai, treasure hunter extraordinaire
![[Alva - Alva_G3_Utzaal_Reply_To_Viper_Out_Loud.ogg]]

#### The Ziggurat Refuge
[DNT] Good work on capturing Doryani. Let's meet up inside The Ziggurat Refuge at the base of this encampment.

#### Alva_Nicks_BloodMagicTome_Offscreen_Yes_This_Is_Canon
I don't think they'll mind if I take this! For... archaeological purposes!
![[Alva - Alva_Nicks_BloodMagicTome_Offscreen_Yes_This_Is_Canon.ogg]]

#### AlvaEndgamePlayerWakeUp
You're awake! I thought you might not make it.. There's a lot to go over.. When you've pulled yourself together, go speak to Doryani

#### The Strange Mirror
Ever since you encountered that strange mirror, this place is darker now, in a way I can't describe... Somebody's here. Someone that isn't us. I keep thinking I hear laughter, mocking us... but I look around, and I don't see anything. You just... keep your guard up, alright?
![[Alva - The Strange Mirror - 1.ogg]]
![[Alva - The Strange Mirror - 2.ogg]]
![[Alva - The Strange Mirror - 3.ogg]]

#### Simulacrum Splinters
You found a splinter of strange material beyond one of those creepy mirrors? Let me see... This marking... we've come across it in our excavations. In context, it was treated as something quite negative, something Karui myths referred to as 'sealed away,' or 'imprisoned.' You should try to gather more of these splinters. With enough of them, perhaps we can decipher the story of these markings. As a treasure hunter, I know: the past holds all the answers, if you're willing to look hard enough.
![[Alva - Simulacrum Splinters - 1.ogg]]
![[Alva - Simulacrum Splinters - 2.ogg]]
![[Alva - Simulacrum Splinters - 3.ogg]]

#### Distilled Emotions
Hmm... we once excavated a ruin where the engraved pictures seemed to tell a story. It appeared as if they were teaching their children new knowledge by imbuing {emotions} in a piece of jewellery. It was a very {old} ruin and we couldn't identify it, but... maybe the distilled energy you found is a remnant of that lost culture. If you find a few more, you might be able to instil knowledge in something yourself...
![[Alva - Distilled Emotions - 1.ogg]]
![[Alva - Distilled Emotions - 2.ogg]]
![[Alva - Distilled Emotions - 3.ogg]]

#### The Simulacrum
Now we know where we might find our unwelcome guest. Let's hit the trickster where he lives, in his so-called 'Simulacrum.' It might still be a trap, but... it's the only way. He will never leave us alone until we face him.
![[Alva - The Simulacrum - 1.ogg]]
![[Alva - The Simulacrum - 2.ogg]]

#### AlvaOnFirstSimulacrumFailed
How was the 'Simulacrum?' Oh. That sounds bloody awful! I suppose he was simply toying with you. A shame you didn't beat him at his own game.
![[Alva - AlvaOnFirstSimulacrumFailed - 1.ogg]]
![[Alva - AlvaOnFirstSimulacrumFailed - 2.ogg]]

#### Defeated Simulacrum
You beat that shadowy entity at his own game! Maybe now he'll stop frequenting our minds and tormenting us with all those whispers and shadows... That {was} him, right?
![[Alva - Defeated Simulacrum - 1.ogg]]
![[Alva - Defeated Simulacrum - 2.ogg]]

#### Unidentified Ruins
The ruins we couldn't identify... they weren't from any other culture I've seen. Not Vaal, not Primeval, not 'Precursor.' Do you think your 'Strange Voice' might be from that long lost people? He'd have to be very old... If you ever get the chance to ask him in person, I'd be curious to see what he says.
![[Alva - Unidentified Ruins - 1.ogg]]
![[Alva - Unidentified Ruins - 2.ogg]]

#### AlvaDreamSequenceOne
As I've studied these grey splinters you found, I've come to believe that they have a kind of... knowledge imbued in them. It's fragmented, of course. Not enough to glean a conscious thought. But I keep having dreams... Nothing coherent yet... but I'll let you know...
![[Alva - AlvaDreamSequenceOne - 1.ogg]]
![[Alva - AlvaDreamSequenceOne - 2.ogg]]

#### AlvaDreamSequenceTwo
I had a more coherent dream after working with a larger number of splinters... I saw a feast. A peaceful, tranquil place. I felt... smiles. I felt calm. I didn't get the impression that this was part of a vast empire, or a grand civilisation, or anything like that. Just a rare haven from the world's ills. I really wish I could have written it down... but it's gone. I can't hold on to the sensations...
![[Alva - AlvaDreamSequenceTwo - 1.ogg]]
![[Alva - AlvaDreamSequenceTwo - 2.ogg]]
![[Alva - AlvaDreamSequenceTwo - 3.ogg]]

#### AlvaDreamSequenceThree
I had another dream... more like a nightmare. There was so much anger, so much hate. They were all dead. The haven... bloodied. Bodies everywhere, mutilated, all because of a harmless little lie I told, the kind any child might. They made me watch. I was alone. Traumatized. I vowed to make them suffer. I vowed to darken the places they felt safest. To turn their very homes into prisons of paranoia and fear. I did it, too. Countless faces twisted in agony and misery. I kept hurting them, but it never made me feel better... it just made the void bigger. When I woke up, I felt... empty. What... What do you think it means?
![[Alva - AlvaDreamSequenceThree - 1.ogg]]
![[Alva - AlvaDreamSequenceThree - 2.ogg]]
![[Alva - AlvaDreamSequenceThree - 3.ogg]]
![[Alva - AlvaDreamSequenceThree - 4.ogg]]
![[Alva - AlvaDreamSequenceThree - 5.ogg]]

#### AlvaDreamSequenceFour
Once you put all those splinters together, I believe I had the final dream. I think I felt... Divinity, as crazy as that sounds. In the dream, I was hollow. Completely empty. I was a liar. A torturer. A deceiver. I'd perfected the art of shaping reality with words, purely to enact misery. I was so good at deception, I lied to myself, told myself that I was a god... I was so convincing, even I believed it. And you know what? It became true... But I knew that if I ever stopped being alone, if I ever let go of my agony, if I ever let myself care... it would all unravel... and I woke up feeling hopeless. Divinity isn't wonderful. It's isolating. I think I'm done with those splinters. I don't want to know anymore. The completed object... it's a fruit. A stone carving of a fruit we used to gather from the shore. Sweet and juicy, like summer, now lost forever... Sorry, what {they} used to gather...

#### Surviving the Cataclysm
You're awake! Oh, I thought you might not make it... There's a lot to go over... When you've pulled yourself together, speak with Doryani.
![[Alva - Surviving the Cataclysm - 1.ogg]]
![[Alva - Surviving the Cataclysm - 2.ogg]]

#### Doryani_3
It's a good thing we resolved our differences when we did. Without Doryani, we'd have died out there. I saw... the sky... the people... they were... well... Let's just say, I now understand why Vaal ruins look the way they do.
![[Alva - Doryani_3 - 1.ogg]]
![[Alva - Doryani_3 - 2.ogg]]

#### Corruption
If it helps, history does tell of a slow recovery after the Cataclysm. It's likely the future we knew was only possible because of the work we're doing here. Every bit of Corruption you cleanse helps build Wraeclast as we experienced it. And if you don't, well... perhaps you and I might never exist. Crazy to think about, isn't it?
![[Alva - Corruption - 1.ogg]]
![[Alva - Corruption - 2.ogg]]

#### Monolith
I've heard about that massive pillar of flame you've spotted. Try to get to it as quickly as you can. I imagine anyone else that's seen it will be trying to get there before us. I'll do some research, and see if I can figure out what it is...
![[Alva - Monolith - 1.ogg]]
![[Alva - Monolith - 2.ogg]]

#### Fortress
I initially believed that there was nothing in the historical record about that strange fortress you found, but then it occurred to me... a great deal has been written about times of ash. Fires that scorched the land, clouds that blotted out the sun, the Winter of the World... If that place is somehow connected, then we may be dealing with an ancient disastrous force that has plagued Wraeclast for far longer than anyone can guess. It may have ended entire civilisations. You really must get in there first. Everything may depend upon it.

#### Alva_G3_ElevatorSeen
Vaal ingenuity never ceases to amaze me...
![[Alva - Alva_G3_ElevatorSeen.ogg]]

#### Alva_G3_ElevatorSequenceOne
These runes... I can make out symbols for 'blood' and 'offering'...
![[Alva - Alva_G3_ElevatorSequenceOne.ogg]]

Wait, no... It's not 'a blood offering,' it's 'someone of Vaal blood'... perhaps if I... Agh!

It.. worked!? Ooh! Now this is {truly} something!

You've got a weapon, I'll wield it. Just tell me where to point it. I've seen the highs and horrors of war, and I'll do whatever it takes to survive. If you've got coin, I'm your man.

#### Shadow_Level_02.ogg
My life has been naught but discipline and focus, preparing me for this. I fight for the Benevolent Dreamer. Free my hands, and those who seek chaos will fall before me!

#### Templar_Level_01.ogg
Do not mistake me for humble and weak because I am a man of God. No. We Templars have learned we must handle earthly affairs on our own. Though God is absent, evil shall not go unpunished.

#### Witch_001.ogg
The elements are mine to control. I know why lightning strikes, why fire burns, and why cold freezes. They do so because I command it. The vengeance of the Maraketh will find those who have transgressed no matter where they run.

#### Mar_01.ogg
I wanted very little for myself. A forge, a bed. They took that all away when they burned down my home. Give me one good hammer, and they will find that there is nothing more dangerous than a man of peace roused to war.
![[Alva - Mar_01.ogg.ogg]]

#### Ranger_01.ogg
The Spirit bid me leave my forests, only to find violence and death. Give me a spear! If they want blood, I will show them what it means to fight for survival.
