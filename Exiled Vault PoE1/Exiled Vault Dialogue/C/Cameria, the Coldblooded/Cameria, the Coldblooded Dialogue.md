## Cameria, the Coldblooded Dialogue
#### CameriaPrimaryDefenderStartsFightZero
Don't try running. It'll just make things worse for you.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaPrimaryDefenderStartsFightZero.ogg]]

#### CameriaPrimaryDefenderStartsFightOne
Looks like our guest of honour has finally arrived...
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaPrimaryDefenderStartsFightOne.ogg]]

#### CameriaPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwo
I was hoping you'd find us out here.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwo.ogg]]

#### CameriaPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThree
Oh no! They found us! What ever will we do?
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThree.ogg]]

#### CameriaPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFour
I usually like to draw this out, but orders is orders.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFour.ogg]]

#### CameriaPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFive
Left you a little present in the cell. Not that you'll live to see it...
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFive.ogg]]

#### CameriaPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSix
Think I prefer killing over negotiating.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSix.ogg]]

#### CameriaPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSeven
Though I enjoyed our little cooperation, I think this time I'll just snap you in half.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSeven.ogg]]

#### CameriaPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEight
Funny what you learn to do while you're dead...
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEight.ogg]]

#### CameriaPrimaryDefenderStartsFightNine
Thought I killed you. Must've just been a pleasant dream.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaPrimaryDefenderStartsFightNine.ogg]]

#### CameriaPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTen
Darkness will consume you!
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTen.ogg]]

#### CameriaPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEleven
Acid will make this fun.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEleven.ogg]]

#### CameriaPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwelve
I wonder what I can rip apart with this new find...
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwelve.ogg]]

#### CameriaPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThirteen
I'm going to turn you to stone and see how you break.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThirteen.ogg]]

#### CameriaPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFourteen
I am the plague!
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFourteen.ogg]]

#### CameriaSafehouseLeaderIntroZero
My, my, usually I have to go looking for my victims. How wonderful.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaSafehouseLeaderIntroZero.ogg]]

#### CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero
Weren't planning to have a party without me, were you?
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero.ogg]]

#### CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne
Oh good! Still plenty of fun to be had.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne.ogg]]

#### CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo
This does bring back some wonderful memories.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo.ogg]]

#### CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree
Guess who!
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree.ogg]]

#### CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour
This? This is personal, exile.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour.ogg]]

#### CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive
I usually prefer to do this alone, but for you I'll make an exception.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive.ogg]]

#### CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix
Show me what kind of goodies that hook can rip out of a man, freak.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix.ogg]]

#### CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven
Save some for me, big man.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven.ogg]]

#### CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight
I should help, huh?
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight.ogg]]

#### CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine
Let me see how you move, Rin...
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine.ogg]]

#### CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalTen
A delicate flower like yourself shouldn't be fightin' all alone...
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalTen.ogg]]

#### CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalEleven
It's my turn to rip the exile limb from limb!
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalEleven.ogg]]

#### CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwelve
This party needs a bit of... chaos!
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwelve.ogg]]

#### CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirteen
I feel like seizing some property. Don't care what... or whose...
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirteen.ogg]]

#### CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalFourteen
Now why would we want to go and destroy a funhouse like this?
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalFourteen.ogg]]

#### CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalFifteen
Eenie, meenie, miney, mo... you!
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalFifteen.ogg]]

#### CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalSixteen
I'm taking that hook.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalSixteen.ogg]]

#### CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeventeen
I'm going to tear you open just to see what you're made of, freak.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeventeen.ogg]]

#### CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalEighteen
Gravicius, I've had enough of your lectures!
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalEighteen.ogg]]

#### CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalNineteen
I'll make a flesh sculpture in your style - out of you! An homage.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalNineteen.ogg]]

#### CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwenty
I'll rip that mask off - along with your head!
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwenty.ogg]]

#### CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyOne
I don't really care who I'm ripping apart, as long as limbs go flying.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyOne.ogg]]

#### CameriaReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero
I'm gonna smear you across the walls for this.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero.ogg]]

#### CameriaReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne
I'll make sure we run you over on the return trip.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne.ogg]]

#### CameriaReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo
Well I guess we'll just clean up your corpse, too.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo.ogg]]

#### CameriaReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree
Need to team up with the exile? No bloody balls.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree.ogg]]

#### CameriaReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour
What, fun's not reason enough?
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour.ogg]]

#### CameriaReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive
Since when do you ask permission?
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive.ogg]]

#### CameriaReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix
I wish you'd stayed dead.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix.ogg]]

#### CameriaReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven
We're more alike than you think, Mutewind.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven.ogg]]

#### CameriaReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight
I couldn't care about impressing you, Aisling.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight.ogg]]

#### CameriaReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine
Just more limbs to add to my pile.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine.ogg]]

#### CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyTwo
I love it when my minions decide to share.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyTwo.ogg]]

#### CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyThree
Nobody messes with the Syndicate and keeps their head.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyThree.ogg]]

#### CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFour
Let me show you how to do ripping and killing proper.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFour.ogg]]

#### CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFive
This ragdoll is mine!
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFive.ogg]]

#### CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySix
What's a crusade without the slaughtering of infidels?
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySix.ogg]]

#### CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySeven
They said I'm in charge here, Vagan.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySeven.ogg]]

#### CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyEight
Hey Janus, I'm the boss now!
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyEight.ogg]]

#### CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyNine
I'll take the lead on this dance, my little flower.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyNine.ogg]]

#### CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirty
Riker! I'm leading now! You do what I say!
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirty.ogg]]

#### CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirtyOne
Those who stand in my way will be ripped limb from limb.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirtyOne.ogg]]

#### CameriaKillPlayerZero
Your bones will rot in these walls for all time.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaKillPlayerZero.ogg]]

#### CameriaKillPlayerOne
I think I'll drag you behind this caravan just for fun.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaKillPlayerOne.ogg]]

#### CameriaKillPlayerTwo
So many limbs, so little time!
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaKillPlayerTwo.ogg]]

#### CameriaKillPlayerThree
Aww, over too soon!
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaKillPlayerThree.ogg]]

#### CameriaEscapeZero
Woulda preferred to stay and play, but this still worked out well.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaEscapeZero.ogg]]

#### CameriaEscapeOne
I did the job. They can't say I didn't.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaEscapeOne.ogg]]

#### CameriaEscapeTwo
Shame we're in such a hurry. Would've loved to peel your skin off.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaEscapeTwo.ogg]]

#### CameriaDefeatedZero
I had you!
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaDefeatedZero.ogg]]

#### CameriaDefeatedOne
Urgh... not possible...
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaDefeatedOne.ogg]]

#### CameriaDefeatedTwo
How? You are weak!
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaDefeatedTwo.ogg]]

#### CameriaDefeatedThree
But I had the upper hand!
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaDefeatedThree.ogg]]

#### CameriaDefeatedFour
No, not the questions again!
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaDefeatedFour.ogg]]

#### CameriaDefeatedFive
Pretty good... for a talker...
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaDefeatedFive.ogg]]

#### CameriaDefeatedSix
What... gonna make me hurt my little friends again?
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaDefeatedSix.ogg]]

#### CameriaDefeatedSeven
Kill me once, shame on you...
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaDefeatedSeven.ogg]]

#### CameriaDefeatedEight
Is this... is this a bloody prank?
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaDefeatedEight.ogg]]

#### CameriaDefeatedNine
Why did I come here?
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaDefeatedNine.ogg]]

#### CameriaDefeatedTen
I don't understand how I lost.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaDefeatedTen.ogg]]

#### CameriaOfferBargainZero
You're my kind of murderer, exile! My favourite part's when their head first hits the ground. Glad it wasn't my head, if I'm honest. So, what can I do to keep it that way?
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaOfferBargainZero.ogg]]

#### CameriaOfferBargainOne
I was a naughty little boy back in my day. Used to make friends with the rich and proper, get nice and close to them, before killin' em and taking everything they had. I can be very persuasive - and patient - when I have to be. I could even let you choose my target, just for fun.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaOfferBargainOne.ogg]]

#### CameriaOfferBargainTwo
I'm not afraid to admit to a core of cowardice underneath my callous exterior. That's what you want to hear, isn't it? Don't kill me, and I'll... I'll befriend another member of the Syndicate and give you information about their job. I know how to say the right words. They'll never suspect me.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaOfferBargainTwo.ogg]]

#### CameriaOfferBargainThree
I get bored easy, exile, and when I get bored, I get the... craving. Maybe with a little change of scenery I won't feel the urge to tear your scalp off with my teeth the way I do right now.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaOfferBargainThree.ogg]]

#### CameriaOfferBargainFour
I'm tired of the Syndicate. I'm going to give going solo a try. That's how I used to be, you know, before falling in with Aisling and Hillock and Gravicius here. They've been bad influences on me. I'll be good once I'm away from them, I promise.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaOfferBargainFour.ogg]]

#### CameriaOfferBargainFive
You want to know what we've been doing here? Sure, I'll tell ya, as long as it gets me back on the battlefield faster. I'm already feeling cooped up.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaOfferBargainFive.ogg]]

#### CameriaOfferBargainSix
Killing and stealing stuff. That's what got me locked up the first time. Truth is, I only stole the stuff so it looked like that's why I did the killing! I don't even want the stuff. You want the stuff? Take the stuff and piss off.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaOfferBargainSix.ogg]]

#### CameriaBargainAcceptedZero
Just like the old days.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaBargainAcceptedZero.ogg]]

#### CameriaBargainAcceptedOne
Deal's a deal.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaBargainAcceptedOne.ogg]]

#### CameriaBargainAcceptedTwo
I knew we could see eye to eye. Here, I've even got an eye in my pocket you can have. No? Alright, I'll keep it then.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaBargainAcceptedTwo.ogg]]

#### CameriaBargainAcceptedThree
I'll find people to rip up in my own time!
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaBargainAcceptedThree.ogg]]

#### CameriaBargainAcceptedFour
Don't tell the Syndicate I told you. Or do, I don't care.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaBargainAcceptedFour.ogg]]

#### CameriaBargainAcceptedFive
Great. Can we hurry this up?
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaBargainAcceptedFive.ogg]]

#### CameriaOfferBetrayalZero
I've been itching to backstab the boss, if you catch my meaning. I'm quite literally wanting to stab them in the back with a big bloody knife. Put 'em out of business for a bit. Long enough to put myself in charge. You can watch if you want. I don't really care, honestly.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaOfferBetrayalZero.ogg]]

#### CameriaOfferBetrayalOne
The Syndicate's a social machine, exile, and if there's one thing I understand, it's faking my way through social machines. If you let me live, I can steal the ranks of those around me and promote myself! It might just be to your benefit.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaOfferBetrayalOne.ogg]]

#### CameriaOfferBetrayalTwo
I don't tell them to their faces, but I despise the other members of the Syndicate. In fact, I've been working on a way to get someone kicked out using a carefully-crafted frame job. If you'll allow me to live, you could even pick who goes.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaOfferBetrayalTwo.ogg]]

#### CameriaOfferBetrayalThree
Traitor's just a word, exile. I know a lot of words. How about I tell you all the words I know about all of my brethren here, and you let me go?
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaOfferBetrayalThree.ogg]]

#### CameriaOfferBetrayalFour
Reckon Leo can take a beating? I reckon he can. Been dying to try, actually. Let me go and I'll do what I do best. Give you a well-earned break from all this delicious violence.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaOfferBetrayalFour.ogg]]

#### CameriaOfferBetrayalFive
Aren't you sick of Elreon's preaching? God this, God that, bless this mess... let's close that mouth of his.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaOfferBetrayalFive.ogg]]

#### CameriaOfferBetrayalSix
I am so tired of hearing Tora go on and on about nature. Let me go and I'll knock her down a peg.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaOfferBetrayalSix.ogg]]

#### CameriaOfferBetrayalSeven
Vorici really pisses me off. He's a killer, no better than you or me, but he tries to hide it like a dirty little secret. I don't. I kill out in the open, like a man. Give him what he deserves.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaOfferBetrayalSeven.ogg]]

#### CameriaOfferBetrayalEight
Don't look at me. Look at that monster. Thing doesn't even sleep! That's who we should be fighting!
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaOfferBetrayalEight.ogg]]

#### CameriaOfferBetrayalNine
I'm supposed to offer to betray here. That's what he taught me.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaOfferBetrayalNine.ogg]]

#### CameriaOfferExecuteZero
I just can't bring myself to care. It's death for me.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaOfferExecuteZero.ogg]]

#### CameriaOfferExecuteOne
The boss here will have my hide unless I act stoic.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaOfferExecuteOne.ogg]]

#### CameriaOfferExecuteTwo
Wouldn't want to appear weak in front of my brethren.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaOfferExecuteTwo.ogg]]

#### CameriaOfferExecuteThree
No interrogation this time. Just murder.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaOfferExecuteThree.ogg]]

#### CameriaReplyToBetrayalAcceptedZero
Everyone in this Syndicate's a bastard, apparently.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaReplyToBetrayalAcceptedZero.ogg]]

#### CameriaReplyToBetrayalAcceptedOne
Can't please everyone.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaReplyToBetrayalAcceptedOne.ogg]]

#### CameriaReplyToBetrayalAcceptedTwo
I will eat you, huntress!
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaReplyToBetrayalAcceptedTwo.ogg]]

#### CameriaReplyToBetrayalAcceptedThree
Honestly, most of what that thing says goes in one ear and out the other. Ain't got time to decipher that.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaReplyToBetrayalAcceptedThree.ogg]]

#### CameriaReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFour
Stop punishing me!
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFour.ogg]]

#### CameriaReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFive
Riker, when I catch you, expect your suffering to be legendary.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFive.ogg]]

#### CameriaReplyToBetrayalAcceptedSix
I will rip your traitorous bones from your still-living body one by one!
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaReplyToBetrayalAcceptedSix.ogg]]

#### CameriaInterrogatedZero
Crude choice. I approve.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaInterrogatedZero.ogg]]

#### CameriaInterrogatedOne
You're getting on my nerves!
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaInterrogatedOne.ogg]]

#### CameriaInterrogatedTwo
Finally, you've shown some mettle.
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaInterrogatedTwo.ogg]]

#### CameriaReplyToExecutionZero
Absolutely brutal! More!
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaReplyToExecutionZero.ogg]]

#### CameriaReplyToExecutionOne
Hahaha that's the best!
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaReplyToExecutionOne.ogg]]

#### CameriaReplyToExecutionTwo
Hahahahahaha ahh hahahahahaha!
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaReplyToExecutionTwo.ogg]]

#### CameriaSafehouseLeaderDefeatedZero
This is a lie...
![[Cameria, the Coldblooded - CameriaSafehouseLeaderDefeatedZero.ogg]]
