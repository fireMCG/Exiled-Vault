## Una Dialogue
#### Introduction
Welcome to the camp of the lost. I am Una. I know you and I never met in the village, but Renly has been sick with worry about you since he got here. This is the first good news he's had, and for that, I am thankful to see you.
![[Una - Introduction - 1.ogg]]
![[Una - Introduction - 2.ogg]]

#### Introduction_2
Welcome to the camp of the lost, honoured Druid. I am Una. I can only assume your presence here is a sign that the First Ones have taken notice of our dire plight. The very land cries out in pain, and you may be just the man we need.
![[Una - Introduction_2 - 1.ogg]]
![[Una - Introduction_2 - 2.ogg]]

#### Introduction_3
Welcome to the camp of the lost. I am Una. This may sound strange, but I recently had a dream about a pagan arriving here... Perhaps you are here for a reason...
![[Una - Introduction_3 - 1.ogg]]
![[Una - Introduction_3 - 2.ogg]]

#### Introduction_4
Welcome to the camp of the lost, stranger. We survive, but we do not live. I am Una.
![[Una - Introduction_4.ogg]]

#### The Devourer
The 'Devourer' is just another victim of the sickness infecting our precious land. Many of Ogham's beasts are fearsome and dangerous... but not like this. The infection in the soil, water and air is changing them. {All} of them. It is sad to see such a great creature slain... but it was no longer what it once was. I suppose it had to be done.
![[Una - The Devourer - 1.ogg]]
![[Una - The Devourer - 2.ogg]]
![[Una - The Devourer - 3.ogg]]

#### The Lost Lute
I don't know how to ask this of you... but I was forced to leave behind something of great importance to me when I fled my lute. It was carved by my mother, when she first taught me to sing. It's in my... family home... in the farmlands... If you happen to travel near those ways, it would mean the world to me if you could look for it.
![[Una - The Lost Lute - 1.ogg]]
![[Una - The Lost Lute - 2.ogg]]

#### Lost Lute Found
You found my lute! I can't quite believe my eyes. This feels like having a small part of my family back again. I cannot thank you enough. I think I shall begin by composing a song about you. In the meantime, I would be happy to play for you, if you like.
![[Una - Lost Lute Found - 1.ogg]]
![[Una - Lost Lute Found - 2.ogg]]

#### Count Geonor
You've lived in Ogham most of your life. Did you ever meet the Count before his madness took hold? As a child, I met him once, and he was kind to me. His smile was even - dare I say it - inspiring. The role of Count has always been reserved for the best of us, and yet here we are. Everything has changed. From the moment this curse fell upon our lands, our way of life has been slowly eroding. If the best of us can fall so far, what hope do {we} have? Do what you must.
![[Una - Count Geonor - 1.ogg]]
![[Una - Count Geonor - 2.ogg]]
![[Una - Count Geonor - 3.ogg]]

#### Count Geonor_2
You must understand our way of life to know how dire this situation has become. The Count is the voice of our people, even above the Thanes. The role of Count was created to unify our clans against our Eternal oppressors, and it has always been reserved for the best of us. As a child, I met Geonor once, and he was kind to me. Everything has changed. From the moment this curse fell upon our lands, our way of life has been slowly eroding. If the best of us can fall so far, what hope do {we} have? Do what you must

![[Una - Count Geonor_2 - 2.ogg]]
![[Una - Count Geonor_2 - 3.ogg]]
![[Una - Count Geonor_2 - 4.ogg]]

#### Death of the Count
You've done well. You have earned a prominent role in our song's story, and I shall sing it proudly. I know that Renly will dearly miss having you around... but he is also immensely proud of you. The darkness that crept upon our lands has been forced to flee, and I have a feeling you will pursue it to the end of the world. May the First Ones bless you.
![[Una - Death of the Count - 1.ogg]]
![[Una - Death of the Count - 2.ogg]]
![[Una - Death of the Count - 3.ogg]]

#### Death of the Count_2
You've done well, stranger. No - you are no stranger now. You have become part of our song's story and I shall sing it proudly. The darkness that crept upon our lands has been forced to flee, and I have a feeling you will pursue it to the end of the world. Good luck to you.
![[Una - Death of the Count_2 - 1.ogg]]
![[Una - Death of the Count_2 - 2.ogg]]
![[Una - Death of the Count_2 - 3.ogg]]

#### The Hooded One
This shade is a curious one. It is quite odd to have a blue-eyed shadow in the camp watching us, but things truly have been taking a turn for the better since you freed him. Some of the folk here consider his presence a sign of good luck... though I wonder if it is actually you that brings us these better fortunes.
![[Una - The Hooded One - 1.ogg]]
![[Una - The Hooded One - 2.ogg]]

#### UnaRenlySon
He doubts himself, but I know he will find a way to protect us. As you well know, he is a good man. I am thankful for his presence. In many ways, he reminds me of {my} father...
![[Una - UnaRenlySon - 1.ogg]]
![[Una - UnaRenlySon - 2.ogg]]

#### Renly
He doubts himself, but I know he will find a way to protect us. He is a good man. I am thankful for his presence. In many ways, he reminds me of my father...
![[Una - Renly - 1.ogg]]
![[Una - Renly - 2.ogg]]

#### Finn
He wears an eloquent mask of words. I doubt anyone here has seen what lies beneath. For many summers, I watched him cut smooth circles around the village square, moving from partner to partner, as if he was attending one of those famed Eternal masquerades. Always masked, always pretending to be something he wasn't, never serious. It's a shame, because when a masquerade ends, everybody that is real goes home, but he'll still be dancing, masked and alone.
![[Una - Finn - 1.ogg]]
![[Una - Finn - 2.ogg]]

#### Leitis
Leitis is from a prominent family in her clan, so I didn't know her well, but I did take hope from her actions. If a noblewoman could marry a commoner, then perhaps a commoner would be free to marry whoever she wants as well. It makes me think about the last conversation I ever had with my father. It was... an argument. Though it tears at my heart, I choose to believe that deep down, he understood me.
![[Una - Leitis - 1.ogg]]
![[Una - Leitis - 2.ogg]]

#### Clearfell
Renly brings the strength, Finn brings the wit, and I'm doing my best to keep spirits raised with my songs. Hope is the only thing we have now, but it's in short supply.
![[Una - Clearfell.ogg]]

#### Clearfell_2
This is home now. Our songs tell of times of renewal, when bloodshed, strife, and courage forge stronger bonds. That is how we will regard this era of Ogham, and how we will remember you in our songs.
![[Una - Clearfell_2.ogg]]

#### The Grelwood
The First Ones ran wild through the Grelwood of old, hunting and brawling as they saw fit. It is said that the spirits of the forest would watch them and be... entertained. Over time, the forest became abundant with the joy of those spirits and their old magicks. It was a haven for the unity of life and spirit. That place of beauty has now become shadowed and deadly. The curse upon this land has made the known paths of the Grelwood twisted and treacherous, so much so, that we can no longer even reach our home.
![[Una - The Grelwood - 1.ogg]]
![[Una - The Grelwood - 2.ogg]]
![[Una - The Grelwood - 3.ogg]]

#### Cemetery of the Eternals
The graves of our people lie beneath the Eternals' tombs. Despite their best efforts to bury our legacy, we remain. Now they are gone, and we live on. This is the cycle of life as we have always known it. Everyone dies, but the clan endures, and the greatest glory an Ezomyte can attain is to live on in a song or a poem. That is why we do not fight the wood and stone to reclaim our buried graves, and it is something the Eternals never understood: we don't need the graves. We still have the songs and the stories that matter. They could never take those from us.
![[Una - Cemetery of the Eternals - 1.ogg]]
![[Una - Cemetery of the Eternals - 2.ogg]]
![[Una - Cemetery of the Eternals - 3.ogg]]

#### Home
I survive, but all that I was is gone. Count Geonor has only been growing more and more cruel with his 'justice'. He arrested my father for bringing in the harvest one day late, and the rest of my family scattered and fled as the soldiers came for them. I was away... when it happened, but my neighbors warned me on my way home, and I fled. Clearfell is as far as I could go before the dangers of the forest closed in. There is scant hope in my heart for my father, but I must believe my mother and my two younger brothers escaped. Even though my heart tells me that they are just songs now, I keep longing for a ray of light to cut through the darkness of these bleak days.

![[Una - Home - 2.ogg]]
![[Una - Home - 3.ogg]]

#### Shadowed Dreams
So this is the source of my shadowed dreams... Not the Tree, but the shade upon it. As strange as it sounds, I believe we should help this creature. For the Count to bind it to the tree, it must be involved in all of this somehow. There is something very wrong in Ogham, and it may know something of it.
![[Una - Shadowed Dreams - 1.ogg]]
![[Una - Shadowed Dreams - 2.ogg]]

#### {A Siren's Call}
This one always makes me weep.
![[Una - {A Siren's Call}.ogg]]

#### {A Siren's Call}_2
Ah... a tale of the dangers of love.
![[Una - {A Siren's Call}_2.ogg]]

#### {Lord of the Trial}
Izaro the wise... Izaro the mad.
![[Una - {Lord of the Trial}.ogg]]

#### {Lord of the Trial}_2
The mad emperor's song... not a tale the Eternals would tell.
![[Una - {Lord of the Trial}_2.ogg]]

#### {Lioneye}
The song of the exiles.
![[Una - {Lioneye}.ogg]]

#### {Lioneye}_2
Ah... the exile's landing.
![[Una - {Lioneye}_2.ogg]]

#### {Lioneye}_3
Ah yes... the hubris of men.
![[Una - {Lioneye}_3.ogg]]

#### UnaTreeWillWaitHere
I'll wait here. The old magicks will protect me.
![[Una - UnaTreeWillWaitHere.ogg]]

#### The Tree of Souls
You have them! Stab them into the runewood sites.
![[Una - The Tree of Souls.ogg]]

#### The Tree of Souls_2
Stab the spikes into the runewood markings.
![[Una - The Tree of Souls_2.ogg]]

#### UnaTreeIdleCallOut
Don't worry the Tree itself will not be harmed. What are you waiting for?
![[Una - UnaTreeIdleCallOut.ogg]]

#### UnaTreeKeepGoing
Good. Now the others!
![[Una - UnaTreeKeepGoing.ogg]]

#### The Red Vale
The Red Vale played host to the final and bloodiest battle of countless conflicts. It was in the heart of that vale that we fought for our freedom against the Eternals. We did win... in a sense... but the cost was far greater than anyone expected. Many generations of able-bodied men and women gave their lives to push off the boot of oppression. Ogham's clans haven't been the same since, even centuries on.
![[Una - The Red Vale - 1.ogg]]
![[Una - The Red Vale - 2.ogg]]
![[Una - The Red Vale - 3.ogg]]

#### UnaEndTreeOfSouls
If nothing else, releasing the shade was an act of mercy. There is no telling what effect a small moment of kindness may have, all things considered. I have faith that we have done the right thing.
![[Una - UnaEndTreeOfSouls.ogg]]

#### UnaIzaroSong
{Una begins to play...}

#### Secrets in the Dark
You must have heard the rumours in the village. All this began the night Count Geonor took his most loyal men into the Grelwood. That's when his growing madness began. {Something} happened out there... Please, I beg of you, travel to the forest and begin your search. There must be some clue as to what took place. I fear that our land's sickness will only deepen unless something is done.
![[Una - Secrets in the Dark - 1.ogg]]
![[Una - Secrets in the Dark - 2.ogg]]
![[Una - Secrets in the Dark - 3.ogg]]

#### Secrets in the Dark_2
All this began the night Count Geonor took his most loyal men into the Grelwood. After he returned, a madness grew in him. {Something} happened out there... Please, I beg of you, travel into the forest and begin your search. There must be some clue as to what took place. I fear this land's sickness will only deepen unless we do something.
![[Una - Secrets in the Dark_2 - 1.ogg]]
![[Una - Secrets in the Dark_2 - 2.ogg]]
![[Una - Secrets in the Dark_2 - 3.ogg]]

#### UnaNewTreeSummonedInWild
What happened here...?
![[Una - UnaNewTreeSummonedInWild.ogg]]

#### The Hooded One_2
This shade... Is it... still alive? Perhaps it can give us the answers we seek. Only the Count's sword has the power to bind souls to the Tree like this. We must free it somehow. To release that being from the Tree of Souls we'll need more than simply cutting his rope... The ancient runes that imbue the count's blade created the binding, and only ancient runes can break it.
![[Una - The Hooded One_2 - 1.ogg]]
![[Una - The Hooded One_2 - 2.ogg]]

#### Agnar
The greatsword Agnar is {currently} in Count Geonor's possession... but the mighty runed blade was not always his to wield. It is an ancient weapon of the old magicks, inspired by the Greatwolf himself. Legend says it was forged and runed for the original clan leader so he might lead his people to a new, safer land. This brought them to Phaaryl where they founded Ogham. Ever since, Agnar was passed down to the leader of the strongest clan. When the position of Count was established in Ogham, the sword was bound to the role. But now... Geonor sullies its remarkable history with his misdeeds. I hope I will live to see the day when someone worthy takes up the sword once more.
![[Una - Agnar - 1.ogg]]
![[Una - Agnar - 2.ogg]]
![[Una - Agnar - 3.ogg]]

#### Gather the Runes
There is a battlefield not far from here that runs red with rust, where the weapons and armour of countless Ezomytes still remain... We call it the Red Vale. You should search the area. There may still be power in some of those centuries old relics. Renly will know how to forge them. Bring the runes to him, and then, perhaps, we shall find some answers.
![[Una - Gather the Runes - 1.ogg]]
![[Una - Gather the Runes - 2.ogg]]

#### Gather more Runes
I see you've already found the vale, and some of the runes we need. But I don't think they will be enough. Return to the vale and search for more. Renly will know how to forge them.
![[Una - Gather more Runes.ogg]]

#### Forge the Runes
I see you've already found relics with the runes we need. What luck! The First Ones are truly watching over us. Renly will know how to forge them. Bring what you've gathered to him, and then, perhaps, we shall find some answers.
![[Una - Forge the Runes - 1.ogg]]
![[Una - Forge the Runes - 2.ogg]]

#### The Tree of Souls_3
My mother's mother told me tales of this Tree. Our ancestors used it to attract fey spirits, until it was given a darker purpose under the Eternals. They would leave Ezomytes strung up on the tree... alive... to starve... to be pecked at by birds...
![[Una - The Tree of Souls_3 - 1.ogg]]
![[Una - The Tree of Souls_3 - 2.ogg]]

#### Secrets in the Dark_3
Renly's done a fine job forging those spikes. Meet me at the Tree of Souls.
![[Una - Secrets in the Dark_3.ogg]]

#### The Wound
He's unconscious, but he's breathing. Though... this wound... We should take him back to Clearfell. He may be the only one who knows what truly happened out here.
![[Una - The Wound.ogg]]

#### The Count's Binding
The wound... It should be fatal, but somehow he clings to life... I fear it will not be long until his song ends. He will never heal while the count's binding still holds sway. Only by a Count's hand can this binding be released. I know an old tale. One that speaks of a ring we might be able to recover, buried three centuries ago in our ancient graveyard... A count's signet ring, bearing his rune of Authority. But how to reach it in time... The Grim Tangle! The overgrown sinkholes and gullies that run beneath Ogham can lead you there. The path is dangerous but... go back to the Grelwood. Find the entrance. We shall see if the spirits of this land still have the will to see you through.
![[Una - The Count's Binding - 1.ogg]]
![[Una - The Count's Binding - 2.ogg]]
![[Una - The Count's Binding - 3.ogg]]

#### Fey Spirits
If the fey spirits are still watching, I believe they will help us. Please, wait a moment.
![[Una - Fey Spirits.ogg]]

#### Fey Spirits_2
The old magicks still thrive! The way is open. Please, hurry.
![[Una - Fey Spirits_2.ogg]]

#### Count Lachlann's Ring
You found the ring! This will most certainly break the Count's binding. Give me a moment...
![[Una - Count Lachlann's Ring.ogg]]

#### UnaNewUsesRing
It's working...
![[Una - UnaNewUsesRing.ogg]]

#### UnaNewSeeSinWalking
Look... he's stirring!
![[Una - UnaNewSeeSinWalking.ogg]]

#### The Seed
This...'Seed'... is that the source of Ogham's affliction?
![[Una - The Seed.ogg]]

#### Find the Seed
So if we are to heal this land, we must find this 'Seed'. Beyond our clan graves is the Hunting Grounds. Cut through those to reach the village. Please, go as quickly as you can and see what you can find. I fear there is not much time!
![[Una - Find the Seed.ogg]]

#### The Grim Tangle
My mother and I would come here to gather mushrooms when I was young. Ervig the Druid, one of the Grelwood's resident mystics, would meet us and allow us entry. He was well versed in the tongue of the old magicks. But now... Well times have certainly changed. Please, don't eat any of the mushrooms. We need you alive!
![[Una - The Grim Tangle - 1.ogg]]
![[Una - The Grim Tangle - 2.ogg]]

#### Spirits of the Grelwood
It fills my heart to see the spirits of the forest answer my call like that. It just goes to show... there are still energies in this world that mean to aid us.
![[Una - Spirits of the Grelwood.ogg]]

#### Ervig
You saw the Druid? Ervig? Oh no... It saddens me to hear he is lost to the sickness as well. It is up to you what you will do about him...
![[Una - Ervig.ogg]]

#### Ervig_2
I understand you did what you had to. Please... let us not speak of it further.
![[Una - Ervig_2.ogg]]

#### UnaVendor_BuyFlaskLife_Random
That might save your life.
![[Una - UnaVendor_BuyFlaskLife_Random.ogg]]

#### UnaVendor_BuyFlaskLife_4
May it keep you alive.
![[Una - UnaVendor_BuyFlaskLife_4.ogg]]

#### UnaVendor_BuyFlaskLife_7
A full flask is a defiance of fate.
![[Una - UnaVendor_BuyFlaskLife_7.ogg]]

#### UnaVendor_BuyFlaskLife_10
May it fill your heart.
![[Una - UnaVendor_BuyFlaskLife_10.ogg]]

#### UnaVendor_BuyFlaskLife_13
Keep it full.
![[Una - UnaVendor_BuyFlaskLife_13.ogg]]

#### UnaVendor_BuyFlaskMana_Random
May it keep you fighting fit.
![[Una - UnaVendor_BuyFlaskMana_Random.ogg]]

#### UnaVendor_BuyFlaskMana_4
Spirits guide you.
![[Una - UnaVendor_BuyFlaskMana_4.ogg]]

#### UnaVendor_BuyFlaskMana_6
Sip from it slowly, don't waste any.
![[Una - UnaVendor_BuyFlaskMana_6.ogg]]

#### UnaVendor_BuyFlaskMana_8
I hope it brings you good fortune.
![[Una - UnaVendor_BuyFlaskMana_8.ogg]]

#### UnaVendor_BuyGeneric_Random
I hope it helps.
![[Una - UnaVendor_BuyGeneric_Random.ogg]]

#### UnaVendor_BuyGeneric_4
May it serve you well.
![[Una - UnaVendor_BuyGeneric_4.ogg]]

#### UnaVendor_BuyGeneric_7
I suppose I can let that one go.
![[Una - UnaVendor_BuyGeneric_7.ogg]]

#### UnaVendor_BuyGeneric_10
That one spoke to me as well.
![[Una - UnaVendor_BuyGeneric_10.ogg]]

#### UnaVendor_CloseShopNoBuy_Random
Nothing? That's okay.
![[Una - UnaVendor_CloseShopNoBuy_Random.ogg]]

#### UnaVendor_CloseShopNoBuy_5
Perhaps next time then.
![[Una - UnaVendor_CloseShopNoBuy_5.ogg]]

#### UnaVendor_CloseShopNoBuy_8
Maybe later I'll have something you like.
![[Una - UnaVendor_CloseShopNoBuy_8.ogg]]

#### UnaVendor_CloseShopNoBuy_11
Thanks anyway.
![[Una - UnaVendor_CloseShopNoBuy_11.ogg]]

#### UnaVendor_Disenchant_Random
It is done.
![[Una - UnaVendor_Disenchant_Random.ogg]]

#### UnaVendor_Disenchant_5
That was tricky.
![[Una - UnaVendor_Disenchant_5.ogg]]

#### UnaVendor_Disenchant_8
I hope you are pleased with that.
![[Una - UnaVendor_Disenchant_8.ogg]]

#### UnaVendor_Disenchant_11
Simple, really.
![[Una - UnaVendor_Disenchant_11.ogg]]

#### UnaVendor_Disenchant_14
There we are.
![[Una - UnaVendor_Disenchant_14.ogg]]

#### UnaVendor_Disenchant_17
I'm pleased to help.
![[Una - UnaVendor_Disenchant_17.ogg]]

#### UnaVendorOpenShop_Random
I've collected these over time. What do you think?
![[Una - UnaVendorOpenShop_Random.ogg]]

#### UnaVendorOpenShop_4
I like to hold on to bits and pieces. Any that catch your eye?
![[Una - UnaVendorOpenShop_4.ogg]]

#### UnaVendorOpenShop_7
Finn makes fun of my collection, but I think it's charming.
![[Una - UnaVendorOpenShop_7.ogg]]

#### UnaVendorOpenShop_10
These are just some odds and ends of mine.
![[Una - UnaVendorOpenShop_10.ogg]]

#### UnaVendorOpenShop_13
Please, take your time.
![[Una - UnaVendorOpenShop_13.ogg]]

#### UnaVendor_Sell_Random
Oh, I like this one.
![[Una - UnaVendor_Sell_Random.ogg]]

#### UnaVendor_Sell_5
I will treasure it.
![[Una - UnaVendor_Sell_5.ogg]]

#### UnaVendor_Sell_9
Another for my collection. Thank you.
![[Una - UnaVendor_Sell_9.ogg]]

#### UnaVendor_Sell_12
It's beautiful. I accept.
![[Una - UnaVendor_Sell_12.ogg]]
