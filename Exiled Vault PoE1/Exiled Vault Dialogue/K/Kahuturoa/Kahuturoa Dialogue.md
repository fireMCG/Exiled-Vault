Place it wisely.
![[Kahuturoa - KahuturoaCommentPurchaseFieldItem3.ogg]]

Okay.
![[Kahuturoa - KahuturoaCommentRecruitRecruit1.ogg]]

#### KahuturoaCommentRecruitRecruit3
That will suffice.

![[Kahuturoa - KahuturoaCommentRecruitRecruit5.ogg]]

#### Ikiaho's Defeat
The Moon hangs a bit lower in the sky tonight, outsider. Good work.

![[Kahuturoa - Rakiata's Victory.ogg]]

#### Ahuana's Defeat
I'm certain Ahuana is proud that you defeated her. She is not a woman of ego.

Ahuana is trying to teach you through battle. You should listen.
![[Kahuturoa - Ahuana's Victory.ogg]]

#### Kaom's Defeat

#### Kaom's Victory
Kaom will never let you hear the end of your loss, ha ha!
![[Kahuturoa - Kaom's Victory.ogg]]

#### Utula's Defeat

![[Kahuturoa - Utula's Defeat.ogg]]

![[Kahuturoa - KahuturoaCommentOnPurchaseEliteUtula.ogg]]

#### KahuturoaCommentOnPurchaseEliteKaom
Kaom's warriors once took on all of Wraeclast!
![[Kahuturoa - KahuturoaCommentOnPurchaseEliteKaom.ogg]]

#### KahuturoaRandomShout1
When's the next match? I didn't know being dead involved so much waiting!
![[Kahuturoa - KahuturoaRandomShout1.ogg]]

#### KahuturoaRandomShout2
Is it day or night right now? Does anyone know?
![[Kahuturoa - KahuturoaRandomShout2.ogg]]

#### Rongokurai
Rongokurai is the Father of Night. Many associate that with evil. Not so. The night shrouds the innocent, hiding them from those who would do harm. The night gives cover to warriors on their raids. More importantly, the night is cool, bringing relief from a hot day. My armour is heavy, and gets quite hot, so I look forward to the sunset. It's the little things.
![[Kahuturoa - Rongokurai.ogg]]

#### Ramako
Oh, oh, let me tell you this tale of this ancient drama. Sione is the harsh and ambitious Mother of the Sun, yes? Ramako is her, what is your word? Husband. Ramako can't stand her, and secretly longs for Lani Hua, the Mother of the Moon, who is kind and caring to all, and very beautiful as well. Ramako goes to our Father of Night, Rongokurai, and asks for the cover of darkness to secretly visit Lani Hua without his wife knowing. Poor Rongo, being a good brother, obliges. Ramako visits Lani Hua many times, until... as happens with such things... Arohongui is born. Sione becomes {furious}, as you can imagine. The Sun becomes so bright, fire scorches the world... My tribe survives that fire easily because we tend to live in caves, but Lani Hua, being a natural healer, steps in to preserve the rest of the Karui. Sione goes to war against her, and she and Lani Hua have been fighting {ever since}. Now, Ramako lives alone in his golden palace, and Arohongui tends wounded souls in the silver palace of the Moon, taking care of it in her mother's absence. The most absurd part? Ramako claims it wasn't him! He calls his brother a liar, and now Ramako and Rongo don't speak. The Day and the Night are forever avoiding each other because the Father of the Sun couldn't keep his belt tied on... fortunately, we Karui are much more mature and responsible in modern times.
![[Kahuturoa - Ramako.ogg]]

#### The Halls of the Dead
I don't enjoy fighting all that much. I just happen to be very good at it. I was given this position because I kept winning. The others get very excited for every battle, but there are parts of the Halls of the Dead I wish I could see. Supposedly, there is a place for the souls of warriors that weren't very skilled, and there they laze around in 'dishonour' eating, drinking, and doing whatever they want. Where would you rather be, outsider?
![[Kahuturoa - The Halls of the Dead.ogg]]

#### Ikiaho
The afterlife is long, outsider. Think of the longest time you can remember. A winter that went on for many extra months, or back to your childhood. That long. Then it's even longer than {that}. We might be dead here, but we're all still alive. Everyone here has gone through the traditions with everyone else. Some were even married for centuries. Eventually, though, time has a way of wearing everything away. You think you've found your partner for eternity, then a hundred years later, you find the same thing with someone else... but not Ikiaho. Never Ikiaho. She turns down everyone, even {me}, and quite publicly. She has been alone all this time...
![[Kahuturoa - Ikiaho.ogg]]

#### Kaom
He is a legendary warrior, but still new to the Halls of the Dead. One of the first things he did when he got here was show interest in Ikiaho, because he had heard she refuses all suitors. Surely, the great Kaom could thaw this frozen heart! No. She turned him down in front of everyone during meal time. Ha ha! That Kaom, what an ego!
![[Kahuturoa - Kaom.ogg]]

#### Utula
Utula has the right idea. Why should we Karui listen to anyone who tells us what to do and how to live? We have such strength, yet we remain subservient. If I want to leave the Halls of the Dead and go to the Chambers of the Dishonoured, where they drink and carouse for eternity, why shouldn't I? Down with tyranny!
![[Kahuturoa - Utula.ogg]]

#### The End of Time
Oh, you've been talking to the Hinekora Tribe, have you? They're very dramatic with the end of time fable. The Rongokurai Tribe has a much more dignified end in mind. When the world gets tired, it will be a quiet and calm slip into twilight, a night that goes on so long it blends into death itself. No more sunlight, no more plants, no more animals... no more people. Then, just as it always has, the sun will rise again on a new world. With sunlight comes plants, then animals... then people. It's obvious!
![[Kahuturoa - The End of Time.ogg]]

#### Kitava's Defeat
You defeated Kitava, did you? Which one is that again? The Hungry God? No, the God of Hunger, right? There are so many Karui tribes, and so many gods. We don't all share the same ones, either. There are tribes in Western Ngamakanui, beyond Ezomyr, with gods most of us are barely aware of. Those tribes are strange, and we don't go there.
![[Kahuturoa - Kitava's Defeat.ogg]]

#### Ngamakanui
Ngamakanui isn't a place, not really. {Makanui} is our Way, and {Nga} means 'from' or 'of.' So anywhere that our people go mostly islands, we like to roam that is Ngamakanui, because we have brought our Way to it. Outsiders that don't understand us often mark Ngamakanui in a particular place on a map, but that is a mistake we don't care to correct. It is better that the Vaal don't know where we are. Speaking of the Vaal, I haven't heard anything about them in a long time. I wonder how they're doing these days...
![[Kahuturoa - Ngamakanui.ogg]]

#### The Fall of the Vaal
Oh... the Vaal are {dead?} All of them? They were such a massive empire in my time... that's... unsettling... well, at least our friends, the Azmeri, can move on down from the mountains now and set up an empire of their own.
![[Kahuturoa - The Fall of the Vaal.ogg]]

#### The Cataclysm
Oh... the Azmeri {did} set up an empire, and {they died too?} What's going on up there?! I suppose that golden cult they banished to Oriath is going to take over the world now!
![[Kahuturoa - The Cataclysm.ogg]]

#### Oriath's Destruction
Oriath {did} become a dominant power, and then {it got destroyed too?!} Wraeclast is a disaster! Who's even left? The Maraketh? At the very least, the lush rivers and forests of that verdant region will still carry on some form of beauty in Wraeclast!
![[Kahuturoa - Oriath's Destruction.ogg]]

#### The Vastiri Desert
Vastiri {Desert?} The rivers and the forests are gone? Everything I knew has been erased by time! Everyone I mention, turns out they're dead! I should just stop asking, but I have to know! The Ezomytes...?
![[Kahuturoa - The Vastiri Desert.ogg]]

#### The Plague of Ezomyr
Ah. A plague wiped out Ezomyr? Of course. I've been down here thousands of years! Everything and everyone I've ever heard of... all dead! What about the Caaltu? They had the absolute best wines, feasts that went on for days, and the women... by Rongo, the women! Please tell me the Caaltu are still thriving!
![[Kahuturoa - The Plague of Ezomyr.ogg]]

#### The Caaltu
You've never even {heard} of the Caaltu? I give up! Nothing makes sense anymore, and Wraeclast is, apparently, a cursed wasteland that only leads to oblivion!
![[Kahuturoa - The Caaltu.ogg]]

#### Death
Don't you know it's rude to ask a man about his death?
![[Kahuturoa - Death.ogg]]

#### KahuConversationWithRakiataOne
Rakiata, shall we give it another go?
![[Kahuturoa - KahuConversationWithRakiataOne.ogg]]

#### KahuConversationWithTawhanukuOne
Cryptic woman, are you calling me fat?
![[Kahuturoa - KahuConversationWithTawhanukuOne.ogg]]

#### KahuConversationWithIkiahoOne
How goes it, Ikiaho?
![[Kahuturoa - KahuConversationWithIkiahoOne.ogg]]

#### KahuConversationWithIkiahoTwo
I was just being friendly!
![[Kahuturoa - KahuConversationWithIkiahoTwo.ogg]]

#### KahuConversationWithMaataOne
What? I can't hear you from over there! Speak up, old man!
![[Kahuturoa - KahuConversationWithMaataOne.ogg]]
