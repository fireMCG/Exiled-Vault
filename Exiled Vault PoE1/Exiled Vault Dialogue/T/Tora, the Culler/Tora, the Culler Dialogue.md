## Tora, the Culler Dialogue
#### ToraPrimaryDefenderStartsFightZero
Don't make me hunt you down.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraPrimaryDefenderStartsFightZero.ogg]]

#### ToraPrimaryDefenderStartsFightOne
Never provoke a wild animal in its den.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraPrimaryDefenderStartsFightOne.ogg]]

#### ToraPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwo
Don't interfere, Exile. This isn't your business.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwo.ogg]]

#### ToraPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThree
You'll have to be swift if you hope to stop the Syndicate.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThree.ogg]]

#### ToraPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFour
The hunt is on!
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFour.ogg]]

#### ToraPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFive
There is no deeper cruelty than caging a wild animal.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFive.ogg]]

#### ToraPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSix
Don't expect our previous dealings to save you now.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSix.ogg]]

#### ToraPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSeven
You won't get me to betray the Syndicate this time, Exile.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSeven.ogg]]

#### ToraPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEight
The cycle of life and death continues, and the fittest grow fitter!
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEight.ogg]]

#### ToraPrimaryDefenderStartsFightNine
You failed in the past, Exile. You'll fail again.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraPrimaryDefenderStartsFightNine.ogg]]

#### ToraPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTen
Death feeds life in the grand cycle.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTen.ogg]]

#### ToraPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEleven
The earth is eager to meet you.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEleven.ogg]]

#### ToraPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwelve
Be like the earth. Become stone.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwelve.ogg]]

#### ToraPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThirteen
I was born with a bow in my hands.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThirteen.ogg]]

#### ToraPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFourteen
Swift like the wind!
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFourteen.ogg]]

#### ToraSafehouseLeaderIntroZero
A mother bear will fight to the death to protect her cubs.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraSafehouseLeaderIntroZero.ogg]]

#### ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero
This den is ours, Exile.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero.ogg]]

#### ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne
We are no helpless prey!
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne.ogg]]

#### ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo
This cycle of life and death needs time to finish.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo.ogg]]

#### ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree
Wolves hunt in packs for a reason.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree.ogg]]

#### ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour
On the prowl!
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour.ogg]]

#### ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive
You should know better than to wander into strange dens.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive.ogg]]

#### ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix
Shall we wait for your God, Elreon, or shall we snare this Exile ourselves?
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix.ogg]]

#### ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven
Oh, Vagan, it's you... shall we fight together?
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven.ogg]]

#### ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight
Prove your worth, unnatural one. Let's take down this Exile.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight.ogg]]

#### ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine
Allow me to help you channel a bit of that Ezomyte savagery, Thane.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine.ogg]]

#### ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalTen
Some prey must be caught with carefully laid traps. Are you ready, Riker?
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalTen.ogg]]

#### ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalEleven
Let's put this animal down.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalEleven.ogg]]

#### ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwelve
This failing den needs to be rooted out.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwelve.ogg]]

#### ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirteen
You've forgotten nature's most important lesson. Protect your resources!
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirteen.ogg]]

#### ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalFourteen
Nothing about this place is natural!
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalFourteen.ogg]]

#### ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalFifteen
Sometimes rabid animals must be culled.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalFifteen.ogg]]

#### ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalSixteen
You know why you deserve my arrows, Vagan.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalSixteen.ogg]]

#### ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeventeen
You're not above the natural order, Vorici. I shall remind you.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeventeen.ogg]]

#### ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalEighteen
Nature rejects you, thing!
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalEighteen.ogg]]

#### ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalNineteen
Killing might be for a purpose.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalNineteen.ogg]]

#### ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwenty
Care for a clash, Riker?
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwenty.ogg]]

#### ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyOne
All of you must be put down.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyOne.ogg]]

#### ToraReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero
This won't end well for you.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero.ogg]]

#### ToraReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne
Your place is with the pack... or in the dirt.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne.ogg]]

#### ToraReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo
You're undercutting the success of our entire organisation!
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo.ogg]]

#### ToraReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree
I've more than enough arrows for all.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree.ogg]]

#### ToraReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour
When you're bleeding out in the dirt, remember this was your decision.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour.ogg]]

#### ToraReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive
Really? What do you think happens to wild animals that lose a limb?
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive.ogg]]

#### ToraReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix
Small consolation, Vagan. Tiny.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix.ogg]]

#### ToraReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven
I saw your approach, Guff - I just didn't care.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven.ogg]]

#### ToraReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight
I will never let you catch me, brute.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight.ogg]]

#### ToraReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine
This world existed long before Man or gods and it will live on long after you are dust.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine.ogg]]

#### ToraReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalTen
Then let the chase begin!
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalTen.ogg]]

#### ToraReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalEleven
It seems only Nature itself is trustworthy.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalEleven.ogg]]

#### ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyTwo
Enrage the pack, face the alpha.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyTwo.ogg]]

#### ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyThree
This hunt has only just begun.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyThree.ogg]]

#### ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFour
We shall surely succeed.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFour.ogg]]

#### ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFive
Careful. A cornered animal is twice as dangerous.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFive.ogg]]

#### ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySix
Be ready to use that hook, Leo.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySix.ogg]]

#### ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySeven
Do as I say, Vagan, and I might not stick you with an arrow.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySeven.ogg]]

#### ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyEight
You might not follow the rules of Nature, thing, but you'll follow mine if you want to survive.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyEight.ogg]]

#### ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyNine
Let's try my way for this one, Thane.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyNine.ogg]]

#### ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirty
We'll use your traps for this hunt, Riker.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirty.ogg]]

#### ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirtyOne
I'm leading this hunt now.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirtyOne.ogg]]

#### ToraKillPlayerZero
The weak perish. Such is life.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraKillPlayerZero.ogg]]

#### ToraKillPlayerOne
You should have stayed out of this.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraKillPlayerOne.ogg]]

#### ToraKillPlayerTwo
The Syndicate's death toll climbs.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraKillPlayerTwo.ogg]]

#### ToraKillPlayerThree
A successful hunt.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraKillPlayerThree.ogg]]

#### ToraEscapeZero
Like I always say, only the fittest survive.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraEscapeZero.ogg]]

#### ToraEscapeOne
A hunter hides their trail.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraEscapeOne.ogg]]

#### ToraEscapeTwo
Like the bird escaping the cat, I can fly. You can't.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraEscapeTwo.ogg]]

#### ToraDefeatedZero
Nest invader!
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraDefeatedZero.ogg]]

#### ToraDefeatedOne
Damn your lust for wreckage.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraDefeatedOne.ogg]]

#### ToraDefeatedTwo
Nature.. is wounded... here...
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraDefeatedTwo.ogg]]

#### ToraDefeatedThree
Only fair...
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraDefeatedThree.ogg]]

#### ToraDefeatedFour
The cage beckons...
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraDefeatedFour.ogg]]

#### ToraDefeatedFive
We're not beasts... we can settle this other ways, like before.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraDefeatedFive.ogg]]

#### ToraDefeatedSix
You're making my life complicated, Exile.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraDefeatedSix.ogg]]

#### ToraDefeatedSeven
The cycle of life and death is supposed to be general, not specific.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraDefeatedSeven.ogg]]

#### ToraDefeatedEight
It seems... you've evolved...
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraDefeatedEight.ogg]]

#### ToraDefeatedNine
I was too slow...
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraDefeatedNine.ogg]]

#### ToraDefeatedTen
I pounced too recklessly.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraDefeatedTen.ogg]]

#### ToraOfferBargainZero
You are more savage than any animal. What do you want from me?
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraOfferBargainZero.ogg]]

#### ToraOfferBargainOne
Some beasts congregate for a mate. Some for food or warmth. Knowing how a relationship can better your quality of life is important out here. The relationship doesn't necessarily even have to be your own. Do you understand what I'm getting at?
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraOfferBargainOne.ogg]]

#### ToraOfferBargainTwo
Crows are very interesting, Exile. Did you know that crows can not only build personal relationships with each other, but learn, retain and teach information to each other? Quite a useful skill, if I may say so...
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraOfferBargainTwo.ogg]]

#### ToraOfferBargainThree
A species' survival is only truly tested when its environment changes. If you want to kill me, then kill me. If you want to test me, well... I have an idea.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraOfferBargainThree.ogg]]

#### ToraOfferBargainFour
You've seen what the Syndicate is doing, have you not? 'Unnatural' is the only way I feel it could accurately be described. I'm not about that life. Not now, anyway. I think it's about time I migrated elsewhere.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraOfferBargainFour.ogg]]

#### ToraOfferBargainFive
A huntress who doesn't know her environment is a dead huntress. I didn't plan on dying today, so how about I tell you what I've learned here instead?
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraOfferBargainFive.ogg]]

#### ToraOfferBargainSix
I don't care for material things, but perhaps you do?
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraOfferBargainSix.ogg]]

#### ToraBargainAcceptedZero
Ugh... people! Alright, alright...
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraBargainAcceptedZero.ogg]]

#### ToraBargainAcceptedOne
Here's to practicing social skills.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraBargainAcceptedOne.ogg]]

#### ToraBargainAcceptedTwo
Adapt or die, Exile. Adapt or die.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraBargainAcceptedTwo.ogg]]

#### ToraBargainAcceptedThree
They'll never find me.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraBargainAcceptedThree.ogg]]

#### ToraBargainAcceptedFour
I appreciate it.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraBargainAcceptedFour.ogg]]

#### ToraBargainAcceptedFive
May your nest be shiny.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraBargainAcceptedFive.ogg]]

#### ToraOfferBetrayalZero
A wolf pack without its alpha is far less of a threat than one with a ferocious leader. Together, we can topple the alpha here, and put me in charge.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraOfferBetrayalZero.ogg]]

#### ToraOfferBetrayalOne
The strong eat the weak in nature, and so it can be here.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraOfferBetrayalOne.ogg]]

#### ToraOfferBetrayalTwo
I do have the capability to have someone rejected by the pack completely.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraOfferBetrayalTwo.ogg]]

#### ToraOfferBetrayalThree
I'll tell you all I know as long as I don't have to go through the cold and dark torture that is resurrection by the Lifegiver.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraOfferBetrayalThree.ogg]]

#### ToraOfferBetrayalFour
Haku's too trusting to be in the Syndicate. Allow me to betray him softly before someone else does far worse.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraOfferBetrayalFour.ogg]]

#### ToraOfferBetrayalFive
I've half a mind to turn against Vagan. He knows what he did.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraOfferBetrayalFive.ogg]]

#### ToraOfferBetrayalSix
Vorici unsettles me. His inclinations fall far outside the natural order. You and I could come to an agreement that might contain his violent excesses.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraOfferBetrayalSix.ogg]]

#### ToraOfferBetrayalSeven
That brute Hillock needs a few more arrows in his hide. If you've got any conscientious bone in your body, you'll understand that someone who does what he does to women - and men, too - is not someone to have as an ally.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraOfferBetrayalSeven.ogg]]

#### ToraOfferBetrayalEight
Cameria is more violent, more base than any beast I've come across. He does not kill for survival, he kills for pleasure. And he doesn't stop getting his jollies once his victims are dead. If you have any sense of justice within you, please, help me handle him.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraOfferBetrayalEight.ogg]]

#### ToraOfferBetrayalNine
It's survival of the fittest, especially in the Syndicate. And I don't mean physical strength - this is a deadly game of cats and mice that covers all of Wraeclast. Are you a cat, or are you a mouse?
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraOfferBetrayalNine.ogg]]

#### ToraOfferExecuteZero
Death is a natural part of life. I've made my peace.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraOfferExecuteZero.ogg]]

#### ToraOfferExecuteOne
In front of my leader, I can show no fear.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraOfferExecuteOne.ogg]]

#### ToraOfferExecuteTwo
In front of my brethren, I can only be brave.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraOfferExecuteTwo.ogg]]

#### ToraOfferExecuteThree
No more cages! I'd rather die.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraOfferExecuteThree.ogg]]

#### ToraReplyToBetrayalAcceptedZero
Animals turn on each other in times of scarcity.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraReplyToBetrayalAcceptedZero.ogg]]

#### ToraReplyToBetrayalAcceptedOne
At least my path is real, Karui, unlike your unseen 'Way.'
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraReplyToBetrayalAcceptedOne.ogg]]

#### ToraReplyToBetrayalAcceptedTwo
And what's that, Guff? Are you planning to ask me on a date?
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraReplyToBetrayalAcceptedTwo.ogg]]

#### ToraReplyToBetrayalAcceptedThree
Survival of the fittest versus might makes right - which of us shall eclipse the other in the end, Thane?
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraReplyToBetrayalAcceptedThree.ogg]]

#### ToraReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFour
I have a better idea, Cameria. How about you leave and never return?
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFour.ogg]]

#### ToraReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFive
You are proof, Aisling, that sometimes Nature makes mistakes.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFive.ogg]]

#### ToraReplyToBetrayalAcceptedSix
All part of the cycle. Today you rise and I fall, but tomorrow will be different.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraReplyToBetrayalAcceptedSix.ogg]]

#### ToraInterrogatedZero
Feel confident in your caging only if you believe the caged will never escape and come find you...
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraInterrogatedZero.ogg]]

#### ToraInterrogatedOne
You are truly a savage beast.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraInterrogatedOne.ogg]]

#### ToraInterrogatedTwo
When bargaining is no longer enough, you show your true colours!
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraInterrogatedTwo.ogg]]

#### ToraReplyToExecutionZero
Violence is part of the natural order.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraReplyToExecutionZero.ogg]]

#### ToraReplyToExecutionOne
You've accomplished nothing, Exile. Death is meaningless to the Syndicate.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraReplyToExecutionOne.ogg]]

#### ToraReplyToExecutionTwo
Sometimes violence is the only way.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraReplyToExecutionTwo.ogg]]

#### ToraSafehouseLeaderDefeatedZero
Rise. If I must fall, respect the natural order by rising to your potential.
![[Tora, the Culler - ToraSafehouseLeaderDefeatedZero.ogg]]
