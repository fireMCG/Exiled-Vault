## Calendar of Fortune
The King looked upon images swirling atop the ancient stone dial.
"You look peaceful" he told his bride-to-be, "So peaceful, asleep in our wedding bed."
But in phantasm, she did not slumber, and what he saw was not a place for dreams,
rather, a wooden box... about to be closed and lowered into earthy depths.
 - Maraketh Legend
