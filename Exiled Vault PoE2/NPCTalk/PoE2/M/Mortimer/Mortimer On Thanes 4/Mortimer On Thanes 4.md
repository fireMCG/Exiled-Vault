# Mortimer On Thanes 4

Ranger: Why are you alone in this?
 ![[Mortimer On Thanes 4 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Where are your other tribes? Shouldn't they aid you?
 ![[Mortimer On Thanes 4 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Have you no allies you can call for aid?
 ![[Mortimer On Thanes 4 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Aren't your Thanes supposed to be doing something about all this?
 ![[Mortimer On Thanes 4 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I know a thing or two about Ezomyr. Where are your Thanes? It is their duty to aid you, is it not?
 ![[Mortimer On Thanes 4 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: Why have the Thanes not come to aid us?
 ![[Mortimer On Thanes 4 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Seems like you need to bring in your allies.

Mortimer: One of the first things Count Geonor did in his madness was damage our relationship with the Thanes. Insulted them and cut off contact, paranoid that they were plotting against him.

Ranger: The ties that bind are precious.
 ![[Mortimer On Thanes 4 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: That's terrible. He's isolated you.
 ![[Mortimer On Thanes 4 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Such is the way of madness.
 ![[Mortimer On Thanes 4 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Gotta hand it to him. That's a great strategy.
 ![[Mortimer On Thanes 4 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Of course. A tale as old as time.
 ![[Mortimer On Thanes 4 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: The bonds of our people have been savagely wounded.
 ![[Mortimer On Thanes 4 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: He'd have fit right in back home.
 ![[Mortimer On Thanes 4 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Mortimer: Those relationships were vital! Built on the very blood and bones of those who fought for Ezomyr. It is nothing but a spit in the face of those who died for these lands!
