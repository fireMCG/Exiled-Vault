# Mortimer On Cracks In The Earth 5

Mortimer: Out there... ancient creatures... lurking beneath the surface... cloaked in darkness... They then burst forth to feast on the souls of the recently departed! Trust me. I've seen them! The others think me mad, but mark my words... it is true.

Monk: Ancient creatures from beneath the surface... you don't mean the 'Devourer'?

Warrior: Are you sure it isn't the Devourer?

Mercenary: Surely you mean the Devourer, eh?

Mortimer: No, no, no... but... that damned thing has likely opened their passage to the surface. These... creatures. They are something else. It is not but one threat... it is... {many}. And I fear what it means for Clearfell.
