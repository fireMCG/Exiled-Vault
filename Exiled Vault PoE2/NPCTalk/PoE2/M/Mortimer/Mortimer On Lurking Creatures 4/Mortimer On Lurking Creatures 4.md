Mortimer: Black-blooded. Green-eyed. Darkness oozes about them wherever they skulk. They reek of a time long buried. Well... just speculation, of course!

Monk: Long ago, followers of the Dreamer joined the Third Pact... Rallying against an ancient enemy with black blood and eyes of green. If they have returned... Perhaps I am meant to resist them.

Sorceress: Could it be? Hmm... perhaps the old enemy has returned. We Maraketh fought a war against them in ancient times. If it is them... I will destroy them all! I will drive them back into the darkness from whence they came!
