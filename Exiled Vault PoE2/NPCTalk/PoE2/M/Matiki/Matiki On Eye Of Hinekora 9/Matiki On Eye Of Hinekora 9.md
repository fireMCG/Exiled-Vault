Matiki: Ah, Makoru! It is good to see you.

Makoru: Matiki! You're alive! I'd heard you were missing.
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 9 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Yes. They told me I was too old to keep taking out my canoe... maybe they were right.

Witch: You went out on a canoe... and ended up {there?}

Ranger: Sounds like you had a rough day at sea.

Matiki: It is quite the tale... ... and I was weak. I admit. When the fog swept over the water... I should've known what I saw wasn't real! But there she was. My Rakana. Sweet and strong as the day we met. She plowed on through the fog. And I chased her like she was alive! Like we were young again. Then... crash! Next thing I know... I'm wet as anything and preparing to be bird food!

Makoru: Good thing our patron here got there when they did.

Matiki: Yes! And about that... There is the small matter of what I've promised our hero here...

Makoru: Why do I get the feeling this involves me?
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 9 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Show me your map, Makoru. There's a place I want to take our friend, when they have the time.
