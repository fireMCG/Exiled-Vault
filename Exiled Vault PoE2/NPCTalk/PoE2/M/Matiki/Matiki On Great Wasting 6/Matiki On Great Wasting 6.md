# Matiki On Great Wasting 6

Matiki: Each tribe has its own story of the Great Wasting. Some call it a Great Fire, or the Barren Centuries. Others, an Endless Winter. The truth lies buried in all these tales. There was an ancient time of horror and famine. But in those dark years, our gods first stepped forward. Tukohama, Hinekora, Tawhoa, and the rest.

Warrior: The Karui had no gods before that?

Witch: {All} your gods appeared then? There weren't any before that?

Sorceress: We call it the Winter of the World... The Maraketh had no gods before that. Did you?

Ranger: You had no gods before the Great Wasting?

Huntress: We know the Winter. Did you not have gods before then?

Monk: Curious. All your gods arose in the same era? None before that?

Mercenary: You telling me you didn't have gods before these bad times?
 ![[Matiki On Great Wasting 6 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: And afore that? Ye had no gods at all?
 ![[Matiki On Great Wasting 6 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: No. For us, history begins there. The Great Wasting erased all that came before. Maybe... there wasn't even a {before,} for us. When did the first Karui emerge from that volcano? Something to ask Hinekora, Navali.

Navali: The Mother of Death can recall only her own memories. History begins at the rise of the gods, because that is when Hinekora was born.

Matiki: Hmm. Curious. So the End of Time, as she recalls it, is really... her death.

Navali: Yes.
