# Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51

Matiki: {Tala moana}! Oh... you're one of us but from somewhere else. Hmm.
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: Yes. Born Karui. Traded as property. Then left to the tide to wash ashore. And finally... raised an Ezomyte.
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: You have lived many lives. Hard though, it is true. But now... your skin is thicker than most.
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: Some scars never heal.
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Well... on this day, by your actions, you have honoured an Elder of the Tukohama tribe. My name is Matiki. And I owe you a debt of thanks.
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L5 - A1.ogg]] ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L5 - A2.ogg]]

Warrior: You need not thank me, Matiki. I am just glad I got here in time to help you.
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Humble too! Hmm... Well, I shall thank you. I would honour you in the best way I can. I offer you the blessing of our ancestors. They know the true merit of a warrior!

Matiki: {Tala moana}, my dear! You have travelled far, haven't you!
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Well, you're awfully cheery for someone who was almost eaten alive.
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Ah, yes... almost! It seems old Matiki has more to do in life before he is summoned to the Halls of the Dead.
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Halls of the Dead? Okay, you have my attention.
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: You see, I'm an Elder of the Tukohama tribe. And I have something in mind for you... I would honour you the best way I can, dear lady. With the blessing of our ancestors! They can tell if someone is worthy of their honour, and you have strength in you.
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L12 - A1.ogg]] ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L12 - A2.ogg]] ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L12 - A3.ogg]]

Matiki: {Tala moana}, tale-woman! It's been many a year since old Matiki has seen one of your kind in the flesh!
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Not quite a tale-woman but... it is a fair assumption. Greetings to you, Matiki.
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: There is always more to the story. I knew that even before I was an Elder of the Tukohama tribe! Now... I must honour you the best way that I can. With the blessing of our ancestors! If you are worthy, they will see you for who you are... and more. Quite clever really.
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L15 - A1.ogg]] ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L15 - A2.ogg]] ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L15 - A3.ogg]]

Matiki: {Tala moana}, young man! An impressive display you put on there.
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Well... that display saved your life, it seems.
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Indeed it did! My name is Matiki, an Elder of the Tukohama tribe. And I must thank you for saving my life.
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L18 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: I accept your thanks.
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L19 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Oh, no, no! I can't leave that debt unpaid. I would honour you the best way that I can... With the blessing of our ancestors! Prove yourself to them. Show them your might.
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L20 - A1.ogg]] ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L20 - A2.ogg]]

Monk: I'm unfamiliar with Karui traditions. Enlighten me.
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L21 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: {Tala moana}, stranger! My eyes could barely keep up with you. Remarkable!
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L22 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: You are safe, for now. Best you get going.
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L23 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Oh, no. I must thank you first. As an Elder of the Tukohama tribe, I have something in mind...
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L24 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Please. It isn't necessary... I can just be on my way and then you never have to–
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L25 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: You'll have the opportunity to gain the blessing of our ancestors!
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L26 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: But I really don't–
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L27 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Yes! A perfect reward, indeed.
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L28 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Guess there's no way around this. Go on, then.
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L29 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Do my eyes tell lies? Do I see an Azmeri before me?
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L30 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Your eyes tell the truth.
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L31 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Wow. What a sight for Matiki's old eyes. As an Elder of the Tukohama tribe, age tends to reveal fewer surprises as the years pass.
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L32 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Elder? I'm truly honoured to meet you. Even more so to have saved you.
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L33 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Ah, the grace of the Azmeri. Not something often spoken of. But your people and mine, have an abundance of similarities. Now... I must thank you for what you've done this day.
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L34 - A1.ogg]] ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L34 - A2.ogg]]

Huntress: It's not needed, you know...
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L35 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: You shall have the opportunity to gain the blessing of our ancestors! Prove your worth to them. Show them what you showed me here.
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L36 - A1.ogg]] ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L36 - A2.ogg]]

Matiki: {Tala moana}, outsider! I can't quite make out your origins... hmm...
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L37 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Just out here doing what I can. Doesn't really matter where I'm from.
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L38 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: True enough. Old Matiki can't help his curiosity. I've been an Elder of the Tukohama tribe for many years and it's not often I get stumped like this.
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L39 - A1.ogg]] ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L39 - A2.ogg]]

Mercenary: An Elder, eh? Tavakai would likely be pleased for you to be returned in one piece...
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L40 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Oh, yes. I'm sure the Chieftain had concerns. But first...
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L41 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: I must thank you for your good deed here. You've honoured me. I must honour you back. I will give you the opportunity to gain the blessing of our ancestors! Show them your prowess. They will see you for who you are.
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L42 - A1.ogg]] ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L42 - A2.ogg]] ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L42 - A3.ogg]]

Mercenary: Uhh... hopefully they don't see too much.
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L43 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: {Tala moana!} Do my eyes deceive me, or is that a Druid of Skothe I see?
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L44 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: Aye. Of... Caer Tarth.
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L45 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Thought your kind were all but wiped out.
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L46 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: We were.
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L47 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Then lucky me - one of the last Druids of Skothe on Wraeclast, here to rescue me. I am an Elder of the Tukohama Tribe. It grieves me, what became of your people.
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L48 - A1.ogg]] ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L48 - A2.ogg]]

Druid: You heard about that?
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L49 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Of course I did! We Karui may keep to ourselves, but that does not mean we close our eyes to the world beyond our shores. Now allow me to repay you. Old Matiki offers you the chance to earn the blessing of our ancestors!
 ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L50 - A1.ogg]] ![[Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 51 - L50 - A2.ogg]]

Matiki: Let us return to your ship. I will show you the way to our most sacred place... the Eye of Hinekora. From there... I will speak for you to enter our Halls of the Dead. You will be tested. But also, rewarded.
