# Matiki On Eye Of Hinekora 3

Matiki: We call this place... the Eye of Hinekora. Far below, Hinekora herself resides. She, The Mother of Death, sees the choices we have made, and from that... has foresight of the path ahead. Now. This here... this is Navali. She is the Speaker. The word of the will of Hinekora. Oh! And that on her shoulder... that's Yama. He's a good boy.

Navali: The Elder's tale of your victory is well received. He vouches for you. But that is not quite enough... The Mother of Death must decide if you may enter. Step forth. Look into the bowl. Hinekora will see you. All of you.
