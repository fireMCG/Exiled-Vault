# Matiki On Ancestors 10

Matiki: When we speak of our ancestors and their wisdom, it's not just poetic. All Karui since the time of Tukohama linger here still, in the Halls of the Dead. Their advice and counsel is our greatest source of strength.

Warrior: Elder... please tell me, do I have ancestors here?
 ![[Matiki On Ancestors 10 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Of course. Do you know their names? Their song?
 ![[Matiki On Ancestors 10 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: I... do not.
 ![[Matiki On Ancestors 10 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: I'm sorry, child, but there are countless souls here. Without a name and a tribe, we cannot find them. Would they recognise your face?

Warrior: No. I was lost as a boy.
 ![[Matiki On Ancestors 10 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: That is most unfortunate. My heart goes out to you. When this time of trouble is over... I'll ask around on your behalf.

Witch: I underestimated the Karui. Necromancy is woven into the fabric of your culture.
 ![[Matiki On Ancestors 10 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: We have something like this, the {barya.} Not on this scale, of course. We mainly use them as punishment for criminals...
 ![[Matiki On Ancestors 10 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: It seems wrong to keep souls out of the natural order.
 ![[Matiki On Ancestors 10 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: When we Azmeri die, we rejoin the Spirit. Our voices become one.
 ![[Matiki On Ancestors 10 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Ah, that is how your Way can be enforced so strongly. The knowledge is not lost.
 ![[Matiki On Ancestors 10 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Think I'd rather take a dirt nap. Imagine never getting a break from being {you.}
 ![[Matiki On Ancestors 10 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: Ye speak as though none are ever truly gone. Yet... I cannae help but wonder if some losses cut too deep, even for these Halls.
 ![[Matiki On Ancestors 10 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Necro what now? Well... I don't know about that.
 ![[Matiki On Ancestors 10 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: This place is no punishment... It is a blessing!
 ![[Matiki On Ancestors 10 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: For us, this is natural.
 ![[Matiki On Ancestors 10 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: One voice for all your people? That'd never work for the Karui...
 ![[Matiki On Ancestors 10 - L18 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Yes. No teaching is lost if the teacher lives on!
 ![[Matiki On Ancestors 10 - L19 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: It is a curious thought. But... you can always strive to keep learning something new!
 ![[Matiki On Ancestors 10 - L20 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Grief is heavy. But even the deepest cut leaves a scar, not an absence.
 ![[Matiki On Ancestors 10 - L21 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: In anycase, my feelings on all this {are} complicated, but the Way was established long before my time. Sometimes it really just is... what it is.
