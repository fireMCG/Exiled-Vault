# Makoru On Shrike Island 4

Makoru: For generations, the Isle of Shrikes was used for a coming of age trial for several tribes. Young Karui try to sneak onto the rocks, climb the cliffs, and take the eggs of the shrikes that nest there. The eggs are a valuable delicacy that many Karui would pay through the nose for. In recent years, though, the trial became far more deadly. The things that nest there... they are vile things.
