# Makoru On Kalguur 3

Makoru: They don't talk very much about their homeland, and well... I'm definitely not allowed to sail there.

Warrior: Are only Kalguurans permitted there?

Witch: Is it because you're not one of them?

Sorceress: You are not permitted because of your lineage?

Ranger: That seems oddly cruel. For what reason?

Huntress: Do you need to prove yourself first, perhaps?

Monk: Do they only allow Kalguurans?

Mercenary: What? Why not? They scared of ya?

Druid: Why not? The Kalguurans don't strike me as hostile folk.

Makoru: Nah, it's nothing like that. It's just part of their culture. First, someone has to immortalise my family's triumphs into an epic poem. Then, it must be told at their royal court, before their King. This sort of custom is not too different from Karui oral traditions, but it's a tricky situation for me. I am no longer part of my tribe, so I have no family to immortalise in song. Tujen suggested that {we} could be family, but he was drunk at the time...
