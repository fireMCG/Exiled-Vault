# Makoru On Ngakanu 3

Makoru: I told you I would take you anywhere, but I'm hesitant about this one. Ngakanu might be the most dangerous island of them all, because... ... I was born there. They won't outright kill me for showing up, at least not in these more... peaceful times. But if you insist, well, let me tell you, it is quite beautiful. I just won't be able to go ashore with you.
