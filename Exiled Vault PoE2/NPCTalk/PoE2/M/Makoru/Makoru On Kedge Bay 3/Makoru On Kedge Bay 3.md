# Makoru On Kedge Bay 3

Makoru: That island has been shrouded in mist for generations... ... even since before the Vaal empire! The tale told by our {hatungo} goes: if the mists part and the island shows itself, you will be compelled to land on its shores. You'll claim to hear the voices or see the visions of loved ones, or of your gods, or whatever else is dear to you. If we go there, there's a real chance this ship will never return.
