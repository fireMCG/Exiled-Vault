# Makoru On The King 5

Makoru: I don't know what to make of the Kalguuran King. I've only heard whispers. Rumours.

Warrior: Gossip usually isn't very reliable, but go on.
 ![[Makoru On The King 5 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Oh I do love some juicy gossip now and then!
 ![[Makoru On The King 5 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I know very little of this King. Tell me what you've heard.
 ![[Makoru On The King 5 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: A monarch with secrets. Typical.
 ![[Makoru On The King 5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Not the good kind, I take it?
 ![[Makoru On The King 5 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Don't believe everything you hear.
 ![[Makoru On The King 5 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Go on then, spill the beans.
 ![[Makoru On The King 5 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: Whispers spread like weeds. What've ye heard?
 ![[Makoru On The King 5 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: Well, they say he's a bit obsessed with Vaal artefacts. But something tells me this is quite a concern for the Kalguurans. I've noticed certain types of Vaal devices seem to up and disappear before being loaded onto ships headed for Kalguur.

Warrior: Perhaps this King seeks something he ought not to have.
 ![[Makoru On The King 5 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Hah! His own people are undermining his goals. Brilliant.
 ![[Makoru On The King 5 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Treasonous actions. You should be careful with this information, Makoru.
 ![[Makoru On The King 5 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Let the coward come and find what he wants himself then.
 ![[Makoru On The King 5 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: The Kalguurans ought to be careful. A leaders wrath can be brutal.
 ![[Makoru On The King 5 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Perhaps they protect him. Or... themselves. Intriguing.
 ![[Makoru On The King 5 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Hah! Cheeky buggers. I'm startin' to really like these Kalguurans!
 ![[Makoru On The King 5 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: They starve their King o' poison - and wisely so.
 ![[Makoru On The King 5 - L18 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: If you mention this, they will deny it, just like they did when I asked... And just like I will deny ever telling you this.
