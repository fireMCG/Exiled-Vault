# Makoru On Arastas 4

Makoru: The first thing that grinning lot of fools did when they got here was build their enclave. The Twilight Order, they call themselves. Spend most of their time brain washing anyone who'll listen. And they've even got a decent chunk of Karui converted to their cause... whatever it may be. Bigger chunk of us can't stand them though, myself included.

Makoru: I just think it's a dangerous game they're playing. Religion always is. I suppose we can visit them if you like, but I doubt it'll be very helpful.
