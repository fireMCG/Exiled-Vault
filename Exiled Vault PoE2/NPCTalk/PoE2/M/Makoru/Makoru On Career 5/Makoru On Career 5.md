# Makoru On Career 5

Makoru: I'm a freshly-minted captain, but not new to these waters. I joined the Trade Guild as a deckhand after I ran away from home. I then worked my way up ever since. I finally took the Captain's Challenge not too long ago. and now, I'm the first Karui captain on a Kalguuran ship!
