# Makoru On The Way 4

Makoru: My people's traditions have remained the same for thousands of years! Until {my} generation, that is... When I was just a young girl, Tukohama, the Karui god of war, was slain by a mortal. That turned my world upside down. Our own ancestor... killed by a mortal? I am looking for my own Way now. One that doesn't rely on gods or old traditions. I thought I might find my path in trade and commerce. So here I am, sailing for the Kalguurans. Other Karui like me have spread out across Wraeclast in search of meaning. The Elders call us {kaivana.} They think we have rejected the Way, that we dishonour our families.

Warrior: Do you take that to heart?
 ![[Makoru On The Way 4 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: One can guess what that means.

Sorceress: I, too, was insulted for choosing my own destiny.
 ![[Makoru On The Way 4 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: It's your life, not theirs. Live it how you choose.
 ![[Makoru On The Way 4 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Oh, Makoru... I know that pain well.
 ![[Makoru On The Way 4 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Is there nothing you can do to heal this wound?
 ![[Makoru On The Way 4 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: What's a {kaivana?}
 ![[Makoru On The Way 4 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: Bah. What good are traditions if they do naught but bind us?
 ![[Makoru On The Way 4 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: Not really. At least, not anymore.
 ![[Makoru On The Way 4 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: Yes... one can.
 ![[Makoru On The Way 4 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: Well, look at us now. We're doing okay.
 ![[Makoru On The Way 4 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: Oh I do! Can't you tell? Heh.
 ![[Makoru On The Way 4 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: It's not a pain I feel these days.
 ![[Makoru On The Way 4 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: Time heals all wounds. As does following your own heart!
 ![[Makoru On The Way 4 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: It means {nothing} good.
 ![[Makoru On The Way 4 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: You'll get no argument from me.
 ![[Makoru On The Way 4 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: Now, when I was a young girl, I visited the Halls of the Dead... ... my ancestors told me that the Way was meant to empower us, not to control us! So who am I dishonouring by seeking {my} truth? It's a debate that I am tired of having. But either way, it has separated me from my family, and I must live with that.
