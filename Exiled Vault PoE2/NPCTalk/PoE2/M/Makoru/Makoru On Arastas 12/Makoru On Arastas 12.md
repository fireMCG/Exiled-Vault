# Makoru On Arastas 12

Warrior: These waters have long been Karui. Do the Elders speak of anything like a forge?

Witch: Please tell me the Karui know something that might get this moving. We need an ancient forge.
 ![[Makoru On Arastas 12 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I am seeking an island with ancient technology. Likely buried beneath the earth. Do the Karui tales mention anything like this?
 ![[Makoru On Arastas 12 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Makoru, have the Karui passed down any stories about an island with an ancient forge on it?
 ![[Makoru On Arastas 12 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: We must find an ancient forge. Have you lot heard anything about summat like that?
 ![[Makoru On Arastas 12 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: May I entreat the wisdom of the Karui? We are looking for an ancient forge.

Druid: I seek a forge, old as the land itself. Do ye know of anythin' like that?
 ![[Makoru On Arastas 12 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: I've never heard any mention of such a place.
 ![[Makoru On Arastas 12 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Kanu: I have.
 ![[Makoru On Arastas 12 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: Really? Where?
 ![[Makoru On Arastas 12 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Kanu: My old tribe tells a tale of a foreign medicine woman. It's a very old story. Took place after a great fire scoured the world. My ancestors had to dive into the sea, just to survive. When they came to the surface, they found a burned woman, floating in the tide.

Makoru: What's this have to do with a forge? Get to the point.
 ![[Makoru On Arastas 12 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Kanu: She begged them to take her somewhere and promised to forge them a great reward. But... the toll was too heavy. She was too injured. And she died trying to use the forge. She was buried there.

Makoru: Where?
 ![[Makoru On Arastas 12 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Kanu: Arastas. Well... wasn't called that back then though.
 ![[Makoru On Arastas 12 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: Arastas? Why didn't you mention this sooner?
 ![[Makoru On Arastas 12 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Kanu: Mention what? An old myth about a foreign woman who died trying to use a forge some unknown thousands of years ago? I only knew you were looking for pieces of some old artefact. I didn't hear nothing about looking for a forge!
 ![[Makoru On Arastas 12 - L18 - A1.ogg]] ![[Makoru On Arastas 12 - L18 - A2.ogg]]

Warrior: That sounds promising. Let's set sail.
 ![[Makoru On Arastas 12 - L19 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: That's quite a specific myth. If it's true, Arastas must be the place.
 ![[Makoru On Arastas 12 - L20 - A1.ogg]]

 ![[Makoru On Arastas 12 - L21 - A1.ogg]]
