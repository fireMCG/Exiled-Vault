# Makoru On Tavakai 4

Makoru: In a strange way... all of this may be what ends up healing my relationship with my father. Tavakai has seen what comes of his stubborn Way... And I've seen that there is some wisdom to be found in our tribe's strength and loyalty.

Warrior: You two finding common ground is at least one good thing to come of all this.
 ![[Makoru On Tavakai 4 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Well that's a relief. I thought you two might be the death of each other.

Sorceress: I am pleased. Let your differences bring you together, not drive you apart!

Ranger: I hope for your sake, he will not let you down again.

Huntress: Don't be a stranger to your tribe. That's all I'll say on it.

Monk: Good. You are best suited as allies.

Mercenary: All's well that ends well, I guess.

Druid: Blood's thicker than water, as they say.
 ![[Makoru On Tavakai 4 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: You're not wrong there.
 ![[Makoru On Tavakai 4 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: I guess blood truly is thicker than water.
 ![[Makoru On Tavakai 4 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: There'll be a lot of conversations to come, but I am hopeful.
 ![[Makoru On Tavakai 4 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: Well, if there is one thing I know about my father, he learns from his mistakes.
 ![[Makoru On Tavakai 4 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: I know... I won't be.
 ![[Makoru On Tavakai 4 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: We are more than that. We're family.
 ![[Makoru On Tavakai 4 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: We'll just have to see where it goes from here.
 ![[Makoru On Tavakai 4 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: And I'd say I'm well-versed in both.
 ![[Makoru On Tavakai 4 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: So, it seems Tavakai has pledged to aid you and... well... The crew and I already discussed it. We also volunteer! I didn't think I'd be fighting side-by-side with my father any time soon... Truly, these are the end times! Ha!
