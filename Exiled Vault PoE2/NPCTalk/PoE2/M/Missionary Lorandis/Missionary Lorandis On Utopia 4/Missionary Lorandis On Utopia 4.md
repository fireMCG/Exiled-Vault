# Missionary Lorandis On Utopia 4

Missionary Lorandis: Utopia is not possible while wickedness in the hearts of men can be rewarded so extravagantly. Our Saviour will bring about that utopia, and in it, you shall be free. We all shall be free! There will be none to rule you, none to tell you how to live.
