Witch: He wanted a lot, but gave nothing.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Servitor Marius 6 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I didn't get much information from him. Quite strange.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Servitor Marius 6 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: He told me nothing really.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Servitor Marius 6 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Why was he afraid to tell me anything?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Servitor Marius 6 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Marius did not wish to part with any important details of your Order.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Servitor Marius 6 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Seemed a bit dodgy. Sounded like he wasn't sure what to share and what not to.

Druid: Strange... For a preacher man, he said precious little.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Servitor Marius 6 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Missionary Lorandis: Oh! We just have very particular roles, you see. He is a Servitor. He tends to the congregation. Quite an important task. I am a missionary. My role is to spread word to those willing to hear about the New Tomorrow.

 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Servitor Marius 6 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Ah. So you're in charge of how the Order is perceived...
 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Servitor Marius 6 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: So you control the narrative...
 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Servitor Marius 6 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: I see. So he's not allowed to talk much...
 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Servitor Marius 6 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: So {his} tongue is bound, while {yours} is free...
 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Servitor Marius 6 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: So his role is to shut up? Charming.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Servitor Marius 6 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: Aye... so you're the tongue, and he the teeth.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Servitor Marius 6 - L18 - A1.ogg]]

Missionary Lorandis: Not... exactly.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Servitor Marius 6 - L19 - A1.ogg]]

Missionary Lorandis: Don't worry, friend. It all becomes clearer the closer you get. With a large operation such as ours, defined roles are an important part of achieving success. So many moving parts, the world over. It is freeing knowing your place in it all! I am very pleased you are showing such interest in our efforts!
