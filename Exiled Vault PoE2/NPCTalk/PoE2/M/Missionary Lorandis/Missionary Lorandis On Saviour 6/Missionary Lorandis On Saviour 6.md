# Missionary Lorandis On Saviour 6

Missionary Lorandis: Our Saviour is a mere mortal, like you or I... only, better. The Saviour is being raised free from the corruption of wickedness. This... this is the key to our success. If you wish to know more, you should visit our enclave on Arastas. It is not too far from here!
