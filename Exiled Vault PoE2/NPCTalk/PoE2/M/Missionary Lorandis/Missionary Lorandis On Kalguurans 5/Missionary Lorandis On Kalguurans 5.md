# Missionary Lorandis On Kalguurans 5

Missionary Lorandis: We do not despise the Kalguurans. We merely consider them lucky fools... In their faraway land, they have no concept of the problems we face here! So they do not take our struggle seriously.

Warrior: What of the Kalguurans {here}? They seem honourable.

Witch: No gods, no Corruption. What do they do for fun?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Kalguurans 5 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: What rubbish. They seem very honourable to me. They are wondrous people.

Ranger: We've always been on our own. Why should they help us?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Kalguurans 5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: We should be working together. Can we win them over?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Kalguurans 5 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: What of it? Do we care about the struggles on their distant continent?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Kalguurans 5 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Everywhere's got problems, believe me.

Druid: Easy to sneer at what ye dinnae understand.

Missionary Lorandis: Kalguurans are not like us. They stand apart. Their souls are clean. No Divinity, no Corruption. Wraeclast has gods capable of horrors beyond comprehension. Yet their sole fear looms largest - their aging tyrant King. Absurd.

Warrior: None of them talk about their King. Do you know something?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Kalguurans 5 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Absurd {is} the word. What is their King trying to do, anyway?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Kalguurans 5 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Some gods can lead their people to glory. Kings only cause suffering.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Kalguurans 5 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Have they told you about their King? What's his aim?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Kalguurans 5 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Why do they fear their King?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Kalguurans 5 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: We fear the danger we know more than the danger that lurks on the horizon.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Kalguurans 5 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Their King? What's he up to, anyhow?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Kalguurans 5 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: They're awful tight-lipped about their King. What do {you} know of him?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Kalguurans 5 - L18 - A1.ogg]]

Missionary Lorandis: The Kalguuran King seeks Vaal artefacts. I know not why, but the reason must be sordid. The Vaal destroyed themselves. We will not make the same mistake.
