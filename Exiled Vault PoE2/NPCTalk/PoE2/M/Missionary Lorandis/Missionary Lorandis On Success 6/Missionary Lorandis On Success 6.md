Witch: How do you {measure} success?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Success 6 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Success 6 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: When will your mission be over?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Success 6 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: How do you know if you've accomplished what you need to?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Success 6 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Success 6 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Success 6 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: So, this Order... what is it ye're after, exactly?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Success 6 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Missionary Lorandis: No more pain. No more suffering. No more horrors upon the world. A fresh start. A time we can be proud of. Wraeclast is beleaguered by the most detestable of creations. Unnatural creations. Creations that manipulate our existence. Their time must come to an end!

Warrior: Do you mean... gods?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Success 6 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Oh of course, you're talking about Divinity.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Success 6 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Hmm. I am not sure I follow what you mean.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Success 6 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Sounds like mankind to me...
 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Success 6 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Who do you speak of? Beasts? {Rathin}?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Success 6 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: The Gods.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Success 6 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Who the heck are you talking about?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Success 6 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: Until that last part, I thought you meant kinfolk. But I'm guessin' you mean gods.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Success 6 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Missionary Lorandis: The gods must never come back. And Divinity must forever return to its dormancy within whatever void it sprung from. Our Saviour is almost ready... He will remake the world. A world free of Divinity. And thus, a world free of Corruption.

Warrior: And how will the Saviour achieve this?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Success 6 - L19 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Evangelists hard at work. I must say, I am not compelled.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Success 6 - L20 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: The gods are responsible for much pain... but also, much beauty.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Success 6 - L21 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: The First Ones have never brought me harm. Why should I fear them?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Success 6 - L22 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: The Spirit is all I know. It's outside the folly of man... which gods are not.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Success 6 - L23 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: The gods are flawed. Divinity is flawed. As they are derived from man. But the Dreamer... he is without these deficiencies.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Success 6 - L24 - A1.ogg]] ![[Missionary Lorandis On Success 6 - L24 - A2.ogg]]

Mercenary: The gods have caused these lands a lot of trouble. I can see that.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Success 6 - L25 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: The gods are flawed, aye... but mortals no less so.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis On Success 6 - L26 - A1.ogg]]

Missionary Lorandis: Utopia will not remember these gods. They will have no name there. They will never be, nor will they ever have been. Praise be in Utopia's name! Praise be upon the Saviour! Now... are you ready to take the pledge?
