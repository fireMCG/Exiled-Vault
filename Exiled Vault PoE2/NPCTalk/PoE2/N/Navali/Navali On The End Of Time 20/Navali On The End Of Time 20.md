# Navali On The End Of Time 20

Navali: Some ends are peaceful, even quiet. Some are bloody, loud, and reckless. Some are lonely... and those are the worst. But the End of Time is not to be feared. It is a release. A mercy. All the pains of a long and weary existence will fall away from us. Then... we shall see the world with innocent eyes once more.

Warrior: I never had the chance to feel young and free... Are we doomed to do this all again?

Witch: Hah, innocent eyes? Sure. So, you truly believe in the Cycle of Time?
 ![[Navali On The End Of Time 20 - L3 - A1.ogg]] ![[Navali On The End Of Time 20 - L3 - A2.ogg]]

Sorceress: Ah, I see. You fear the end, but long for the new beginning.
 ![[Navali On The End Of Time 20 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: You speak of renewal. Of new life.
 ![[Navali On The End Of Time 20 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: That sounds... lovely. Like the cycle of life, the end is not to be feared.

Huntress: I've never felt so small. It's humbling.
 ![[Navali On The End Of Time 20 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Forgive me, miss, but it sounds like you {remember} all these dooms.
 ![[Navali On The End Of Time 20 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: Ye call it mercy... but what mercy's there in livin' the same hurts, over and over, with no chance to mend 'em? 
 Sounds like no matter what I do... I'm bound to end up here again.

Navali: It is not a question of belief. Hinekora has seen it - and through her eyes, so have I.
 ![[Navali On The End Of Time 20 - L10 - A1.ogg]] ![[Navali On The End Of Time 20 - L10 - A2.ogg]]

Navali: They are one and the same. The end gives birth to the beginning. The beginning, to the end.
 ![[Navali On The End Of Time 20 - L11 - A1.ogg]] ![[Navali On The End Of Time 20 - L11 - A2.ogg]]

Sorceress: [NOAUDIO] And in between... I will end up back here.
 ![[Navali On The End Of Time 20 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Navali: All life is renewal. All death, return. The circle closes, only to open again.
 ![[Navali On The End Of Time 20 - L13 - A1.ogg]] ![[Navali On The End Of Time 20 - L13 - A2.ogg]]

Monk: And at the end of it all, we'll be here... having the same conversation.
 ![[Navali On The End Of Time 20 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Navali: You are not small, child. Only part of something vast.
 ![[Navali On The End Of Time 20 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: And this {vastness} just... never ends?
 ![[Navali On The End Of Time 20 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Navali: It ends... and begins. And ends, and begins. On and on into eternity.
 ![[Navali On The End Of Time 20 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Navali: I do, and so much more besides.
 ![[Navali On The End Of Time 20 - L18 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: What about this? Do you remember this chat we're havin' right now?
 ![[Navali On The End Of Time 20 - L19 - A1.ogg]]

Navali: Yes. You and I shall have this conversation again... ...as we have before... many times.
 ![[Navali On The End Of Time 20 - L20 - A1.ogg]] ![[Navali On The End Of Time 20 - L20 - A2.ogg]]

Witch: Of course. And how long is one of these Cycles, supposedly?
 ![[Navali On The End Of Time 20 - L21 - A1.ogg]]

Navali: The life of an Elder, but twice, a hundred times over, then thrice and once.
 ![[Navali On The End Of Time 20 - L22 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: That's... um... quite specific...?
 ![[Navali On The End Of Time 20 - L23 - A1.ogg]]

Navali: That is the longest we have ever endured. But really, It depends on the nature of the end...
 ![[Navali On The End Of Time 20 - L24 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: When are we now, compared to all that?
 ![[Navali On The End Of Time 20 - L25 - A1.ogg]]

Navali: There are very few prophecies that have yet to come to pass.
 ![[Navali On The End Of Time 20 - L26 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: So... this is what fear feels like... I don't think I like it.
