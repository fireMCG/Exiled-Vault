# Navali On The Cycle Of Time 3

Warrior: What did you mean by 'Time circled upon itself?'

Witch: I've read a claim like this once before, but I'm still skeptical. Tell me about this supposed 'Cycle of Time.'

Sorceress: Our tales have no mention of this 'circling of Time.' What is that?

Monk: I've... dreamt about this... How does Time circle upon itself...?

Ranger: What's this about Time circling upon itself?

Huntress: My Elders once told me a story about a place where Time is a circle. What does that mean?

Mercenary: Time circled upon itself, eh? Do I dare ask?

Druid: So ye're sayin' all this has happened before... and will again?

Navali: One day, Time will end. Then, Time will begin again. Hinekora remembers the Future-Past. Not very clearly, but enough to guide our way forward. You do not remember our previous meetings... but I do, by the grace of Hinekora's sight.

Mercenary: I shouldn't have asked.
