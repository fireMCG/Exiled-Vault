# Tavakai On The Way 4

Tavakai: Long ago, Tukohama put axes in our hands and taught us to fight. {That} is the most important lesson of our Way. We were nothing before we were given strength.

Ranger: It makes sense to me.

Huntress: This 'Tukohama'... I like the sound of him.

Monk: You believe you couldn't fight before Tukohama taught you? Curious.

Witch: Tukohama is dead, isn't he?

Sorceress: Strength is vital to overcoming our own weaknesses. It is true.

Warrior: Tukohama seems to have taught you well.

Mercenary: Yeah, mate. Strong is good. Agreed.

Druid: Strength's well and good... provided it's used to protect, not to conquer.

Tavakai: Show some respect, will you?
 ![[Tavakai On The Way 4 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Could someone think before they had a brain? It is obvious.
 ![[Tavakai On The Way 4 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Protection means nothing if you lack the will to do what is necessary.
 ![[Tavakai On The Way 4 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Had we been united in our strength, perhaps history would have told a different tale. Now, the tribes must stand together and put the Karui first. We will always have neighbours, but they must acknowledge our strength. And one way, or another... they shall.
