Ranger: I don't know that it's any of your business, but I suppose we're on the same side. I'm looking for pieces of an ancient Weapon that can supposedly defeat Corruption.

 ![[Tavakai On Your Mission 5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I am on a mission to find and rebuild an ancient Weapon. A Weapon that may help us destroy Corruption.

Druid: I seek an end to Corruption - and yer waters may hide the key. An ancient Weapon, to be precise.
 ![[Tavakai On Your Mission 5 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Hmm. Our islands have become more and more {sickened} of late. Those who stray, fall ill with the Blood Fever, and are cast out to die alone. My {hatungo} worries that the Beast has returned to the world once more.

Ranger: Your {hatungo} is right. I need that Weapon to drain and remove Corruption.
 ![[Tavakai On Your Mission 5 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Your {hatungo} sure is wise. That Weapon can drain and remove {rathin}. It's our only chance to destroy the Beast.
 ![[Tavakai On Your Mission 5 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: It has returned, indeed. That is why humanity needs the Weapon - to drain and remove Corruption.
 ![[Tavakai On Your Mission 5 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Oh, it {has.} That's what the Weapon is for... to drain and remove Corruption.
 ![[Tavakai On Your Mission 5 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: The Beast has indeed returned... and the Maraketh are on the move once again. I need the Weapon to drain and remove Corruption.
 ![[Tavakai On Your Mission 5 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: It has. That's why we need the Weapon... to drain and remove Corruption.
 ![[Tavakai On Your Mission 5 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: That's spot on. It's why I need the Weapon. To drain and remove Corruption.
 ![[Tavakai On Your Mission 5 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: Aye - it {has} returned. And only {that} Weapon can drain and remove Corruption.
 ![[Tavakai On Your Mission 5 - L18 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: This Weapon... it sounds like it could cure the Blood Fever. We believe it is caused by Corruption contaminating our very blood, so removing it may heal that sickness. Hmmm... a powerful Weapon indeed... I suppose I can allow you to continue your search, for now. We will not interfere with your passage on our waters... but you best remain respectful.
