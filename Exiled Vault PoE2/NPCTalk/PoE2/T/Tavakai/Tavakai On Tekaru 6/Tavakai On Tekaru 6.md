# Tavakai On Tekaru 6

Tavakai: Tukohama tasked his tribe— {my} tribe—with keeping that Deceiver in his prison. Our sacred duty kept us in this region, even though we longed for the sea... but it is good that we stayed.

Ranger: It was foolish to not have further protections.
 ![[Tavakai On Tekaru 6 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: I feel guilty for my trespass and for doing what I did. But I didn't know.
 ![[Tavakai On Tekaru 6 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Ah, so it was your job to keep him there.
 ![[Tavakai On Tekaru 6 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Chieftain I must say... it seemed a little too easy to set him free...
 ![[Tavakai On Tekaru 6 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Such a powerful being, left out in the open? I cannot comprehend how this has happened.
 ![[Tavakai On Tekaru 6 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: Why was he not guarded further?
 ![[Tavakai On Tekaru 6 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: I've seen better security in a Korathin pleasure den.
 ![[Tavakai On Tekaru 6 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: I've long known of the Raven Trickster's deceit. I was a damn fool to free him.
 ![[Tavakai On Tekaru 6 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Best you mind your mouth.
 ![[Tavakai On Tekaru 6 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: That is no excuse.
 ![[Tavakai On Tekaru 6 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Yes. It is what has kept our people here for so many generations.
 ![[Tavakai On Tekaru 6 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: All thanks to you and these damn Kalguurans...
 ![[Tavakai On Tekaru 6 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Capturing him was a miracle in itself... it was then impossible to move him.
 ![[Tavakai On Tekaru 6 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: That binding... had stood the test of time.
 ![[Tavakai On Tekaru 6 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: I don't want to know what that means...
 ![[Tavakai On Tekaru 6 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Yes. You were.
 ![[Tavakai On Tekaru 6 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: We tried posting warriors to keep watch over the prison. He'd drive them mad. They'd throw themselves into the sea. Instead, we allowed his fog to wreak its havoc and in turn... keep him hidden. Besides... I had no idea Kalguuran runes could undo our ancestral binding. Yet another reason for us to not get along.

Ranger: As I've said... what's done is done.
 ![[Tavakai On Tekaru 6 - L19 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: It's remarkable you kept him there this whole time.
 ![[Tavakai On Tekaru 6 - L20 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: In time, he will not be of any concern.
 ![[Tavakai On Tekaru 6 - L21 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Well, can't do much about it now, can we?
 ![[Tavakai On Tekaru 6 - L22 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Please forgive me. It is a regrettable situation. I did not mean harm.
 ![[Tavakai On Tekaru 6 - L23 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: It was an unfortunate series of mistakes.
 ![[Tavakai On Tekaru 6 - L24 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Well, least you lot are free of worrying if he's still there, I guess.
 ![[Tavakai On Tekaru 6 - L25 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: Mistake's been made. Naught we can do now but move forward.
 ![[Tavakai On Tekaru 6 - L26 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: For untold generations, he slept soundly in that prison. But the Deceiver woke from his slumber twenty years ago, and has been causing more and more problems ever since. The fog... crashing ships... foul dreams... cursed voices... Even one of our Elders fell for his lies, and went missing. But it will be much worse now that the Deceiver is free, thanks to you.

Tavakai: For untold generations, he slept soundly in that prison. But the Deceiver woke from his slumber twenty years ago, and has been causing more and more problems ever since. The fog... crashing ships... foul dreams... cursed voices... Even Matiki, the Elder you found, was deceived and led astray by Tekaru's lies. It will be much worse now that the Deceiver is free, thanks to you.
