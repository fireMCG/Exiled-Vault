# Tavakai On Enslaved 4

Tavakai: It began with our remote tribes. They would disappear from their islands. Gone without a trace. For generations, the Eternal Empire... and the bastards of Oriath... raided the weakest of our people and took them as slaves. But where are those slavers now? Dead! And gone!

Ranger: Even in Ogham, the Ezomytes fought to throw off the Empire's boot.

Huntress: It's a shame the Eternals were descended from the mountainborn. They should have never left their mountain. It were the wrong path.

Monk: History erases us all, eventually.

Witch: Dead's not always gone, but I see your point.

Warrior: Good riddance.

Mercenary: And yet Trarthus lives on, long after. To hell with them Eternal bastards!

Druid: A fate well-earned.

Tavakai: Long... may they burn.

Tavakai: Your dark tongue does not humour me.
 ![[Tavakai On Enslaved 4 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Yes! A thousand times over!
 ![[Tavakai On Enslaved 4 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: So, we should care about nothing? Be subjugated? Live in fear? The beauty of freedom is the essence of life.

Tavakai: And look where the Empire is now...
 ![[Tavakai On Enslaved 4 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: The Azmeri are not to blame for their descendants' mistakes... They must only answer for themselves.
 ![[Tavakai On Enslaved 4 - L15 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai On Enslaved 4 - L15 - A2.ogg]]

Tavakai: Yes! The only good Eternal bastard... is a dead one!
 ![[Tavakai On Enslaved 4 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: So it was. And may their spirits find no peace.
 ![[Tavakai On Enslaved 4 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Now, we must rise, stronger than ever! We will not stray again from the old Way, the true Way. The Way that carried us through history. We must be strong for the world to see, so that {we} are the masters of our own destiny!
