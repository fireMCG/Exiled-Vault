# Tavakai On The Beast 8

Tavakai: Of course we know of the Beast. Every culture on Wraeclast knows of the Beast. It kept the gods asleep. Tekaru in his slumber. But the Corruption... the Blood Fever... this price is too heavy to pay.

Kaimana: Divinity... and Corruption... yes! Both unnatural curses upon the world. Think about how simple things would be without them. But, a mystic knows, what's simple isn't always true.
