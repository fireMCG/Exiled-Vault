# Tavakai On Ngakanu 37

Tavakai: This has been home to the Tukohama Tribe for countless generations. Though we stayed for our solemn duty, we thrived because of our love of these shores.

Kaimana: The tides wash ashore, bringing life and abundance. Yes! This is our home and our tribe is an ever growing family. Together, we thrive, until Tukohama welcomes us again into his embrace.

Ranger: I've never known a real {family}. All I've known is isolation. I've learned to trust only myself.
 ![[Tavakai On Ngakanu 37 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Kaimana: Oh, my child! That hurts my heart to hear. But I understand you. Yes! You know the pain of silence is nothing compared to the hurt of a misplaced word from one that we adore.
 ![[Tavakai On Ngakanu 37 - L4 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai On Ngakanu 37 - L4 - A2.ogg]]

Ranger: That... is true.
 ![[Tavakai On Ngakanu 37 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Kaimana: But closing off your heart and soul... from the world around you... that does more damage than any word can. For it is death in life. The beasts and the trees can only carry your soul so far. We need each other, child. We need connection.

Ranger: I can't... I won't.
 ![[Tavakai On Ngakanu 37 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Kaimana: You can. And one day, when you are ready... You will. I can see it in your eyes. When the time comes, don't be frightened. Yes! You {will} heal. I promise you.

Huntress: The mountainborn are much less forgiving of each other than the Karui appear to be.
 ![[Tavakai On Ngakanu 37 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Don't let our kindness blind you. There are limits. Boundaries we will maintain. The weak will not survive. And this is the brutal nature of life. We do not stand in its way.
 ![[Tavakai On Ngakanu 37 - L10 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai On Ngakanu 37 - L10 - A2.ogg]]

Matiki: Tukohama showed us strength. Strength {is} a kindness. Showing weakness does nothing for your community. Weakness takes many forms. Strength is truth. Strength is honour. In most cases, it is simple to tell one from the other.
 ![[Tavakai On Ngakanu 37 - L11 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai On Ngakanu 37 - L11 - A2.ogg]]

Huntress: Perhaps we aren't so different after all.
 ![[Tavakai On Ngakanu 37 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: My sense of family and belonging is solely tied to the Dreamer. His path is all I see.
 ![[Tavakai On Ngakanu 37 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: I do not know who you speak of. This... Dreamer. What do {you} know of him?
 ![[Tavakai On Ngakanu 37 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: I know that he has well laid plans that will free me. Wholly. And that my potential will continue to soar under his guidance.
 ![[Tavakai On Ngakanu 37 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Well.. my father once told me, Matiki, if you are to speak, make sure your words mean something. Empty words carry no message. No meaning. Consider this lesson, my friend.
 ![[Tavakai On Ngakanu 37 - L16 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai On Ngakanu 37 - L16 - A2.ogg]]

Witch: I'm not entirely sure how death works around here...
 ![[Tavakai On Ngakanu 37 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Kaimana: Death and honour are bound to each other. This is important, yes! If the ancestors see you, if they recognize you, then you can never truly die. Oh yes! It is part of the Way.
 ![[Tavakai On Ngakanu 37 - L18 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai On Ngakanu 37 - L18 - A2.ogg]]

Witch: I've no idea what you're talking about.
 ![[Tavakai On Ngakanu 37 - L19 - A1.ogg]]

Kaimana: Oh come now! You must surely have seen that there is more to life and death than what it seems?
 ![[Tavakai On Ngakanu 37 - L20 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Trust me, dear, I'm {very} aware of that.
 ![[Tavakai On Ngakanu 37 - L21 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: We share a love of our home. The Maraketh cherish the Vastiri, even though at times... it can feel like it holds no love for us.
 ![[Tavakai On Ngakanu 37 - L22 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Sand and water are not so different. The tide is not always on our side either. But we know our place in the world. We know that we owe respect to its power. I am sure the Maraketh know this of the Vastiri, mmm?
 ![[Tavakai On Ngakanu 37 - L23 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai On Ngakanu 37 - L23 - A2.ogg]] ![[Tavakai On Ngakanu 37 - L23 - A3.ogg]]

Sorceress: It is true. We fear the sands. And admire them. You are both wise, indeed.
 ![[Tavakai On Ngakanu 37 - L24 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: It is a beautiful place. I envy this sense of timeless belonging.
 ![[Tavakai On Ngakanu 37 - L25 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Listen to me now. You may come here from distant shores, but you are still connected to us. The tribes all have their own songs, their own tastes, their own Way... but we are all Karui. We are bound beyond what we see. Beyond who we think we are. And I am proud to know you.
 ![[Tavakai On Ngakanu 37 - L26 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai On Ngakanu 37 - L26 - A2.ogg]] ![[Tavakai On Ngakanu 37 - L26 - A3.ogg]]

Warrior: I... am touched. Thank you.
 ![[Tavakai On Ngakanu 37 - L27 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: All sounds quite lovely. Where I'm from it isn't so pretty. Death means coin and is commonplace. Maybe I've gotten a bit... desensitised to it all.
 ![[Tavakai On Ngakanu 37 - L28 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai On Ngakanu 37 - L28 - A2.ogg]]

Kaimana: You have known love in your life. Yes! You can't hide that. Try as you may.
 ![[Tavakai On Ngakanu 37 - L29 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: We can't help where we are born. Who we are born to. But... with some hard work... we can shape who we choose to become. So, who do you choose to be?
 ![[Tavakai On Ngakanu 37 - L30 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai On Ngakanu 37 - L30 - A2.ogg]] ![[Tavakai On Ngakanu 37 - L30 - A3.ogg]]

Mercenary: Good question.
 ![[Tavakai On Ngakanu 37 - L31 - A1.ogg]]

Kaimana: Yes! And you have your whole life to answer it.
 ![[Tavakai On Ngakanu 37 - L32 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: Ye've a gift here. A true home. Guard it well... for not all of us kept ours. Bah. Listen to me, wallowin' like an old fool. Forget it.
 ![[Tavakai On Ngakanu 37 - L33 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai On Ngakanu 37 - L33 - A2.ogg]]

Kaimana: Such sorrow. Yours is a heart that has known true pain, yes...
 ![[Tavakai On Ngakanu 37 - L34 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: But that means it has known love, too - and can do again.
 ![[Tavakai On Ngakanu 37 - L35 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: Ye think so?
 ![[Tavakai On Ngakanu 37 - L36 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: I know so. A benefit of being as old as I am. Hah!
 ![[Tavakai On Ngakanu 37 - L37 - A1.ogg]]
