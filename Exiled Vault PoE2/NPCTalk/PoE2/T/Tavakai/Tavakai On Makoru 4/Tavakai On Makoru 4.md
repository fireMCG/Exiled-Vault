# Tavakai On Makoru 4

Tavakai: It is... disappointing... to see our young abandoning the Way and becoming... what? Workhands? For the Kalguurans? It is ridiculous! She could be so much more!

Ranger: {I} find her rather impressive. You should give her a chance.
 ![[Tavakai On Makoru 4 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Makoru is capable and skilled. I don't see the problem, meself.
 ![[Tavakai On Makoru 4 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Ah, but if only we had such clear insight for ourselves, the way we do for others.
 ![[Tavakai On Makoru 4 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: I think she's doing just fine. Makoru's the least intolerable person I've met here.
 ![[Tavakai On Makoru 4 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: But Chieftain, with respect, who are you to judge her path?
 ![[Tavakai On Makoru 4 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: She will make a name for herself, in her own way.
 ![[Tavakai On Makoru 4 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Hey, don't knock hired-hands. Trade's the bones of it all. Gets us soft beds, privies, and such. All the things that make life worth living.

Druid: She forges her own path. Is that not enough?
 ![[Tavakai On Makoru 4 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: I am her father! So I am more than qualified!
 ![[Tavakai On Makoru 4 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: She is more than capable! Which is why she belongs with us!
 ![[Tavakai On Makoru 4 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: If that is all that makes your life worth living, then I pity you.
 ![[Tavakai On Makoru 4 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Enough? Who are you to say what is 'enough' for a daughter of the Karui?
 ![[Tavakai On Makoru 4 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Ugh. The First Karui Captain of some outsider's fleet, is there really honour in that? I doubt it. Kanu rejected us to be a lowly ' {first mate}', as they call it. I know his father. He is deeply ashamed. The youth these days are more foolish than ever.
