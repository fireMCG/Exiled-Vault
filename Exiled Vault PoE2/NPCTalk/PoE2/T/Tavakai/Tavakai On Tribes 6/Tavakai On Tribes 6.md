# Tavakai On Tribes 6

Tavakai: We gather from time to time. Not as often as we should. But it usually always becomes some sort of... altercation. Some of us just have very different ideas.

Matiki: It is our differences that make us stronger.

Tavakai: Hmm... it is not your business, but I will share this with you. I appealed to Tukohama. To all the Ancestors. I asked them for guidance. Tukohama heard me. His presence rumbled the very earth. And my axe... it glowed against the night, filled with his strength. It was a reminder of what he taught us so long ago.

Tavakai: A good question. I appealed to Tukohama. To all the Ancestors. I asked them for guidance. Tukohama heard me. His presence rumbled the very earth. And my axe... it glowed against the night, filled with his strength. It was a reminder of what he taught us so long ago.

Matiki: We have not known the Ancestors to reveal their Will to us in such a way for a very long time. Tavakai is our true {Ngakuramakoi.} Where he leads, we will follow without question. It is only a matter of time before the other tribes recognise his strength.
