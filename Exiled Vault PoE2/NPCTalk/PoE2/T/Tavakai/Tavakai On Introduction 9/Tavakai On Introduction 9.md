# Tavakai On Introduction 9

Tavakai: What possessed you to break our ancestral binding? You have released {Tekaru,} the Deceiver! Now, he's free to wreak havoc on Wraeclast once more. I should take your head where you stand!

Makoru: You will do no such thing! How were we to know? I didn't even know about that prison, or what was held there!
 ![[Tavakai On Introduction 9 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: It was the concern of Chieftains and the {hatungo,} not those who reject the Way!
 ![[Tavakai On Introduction 9 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: The typical arrogance of authority. You must be the local Chieftain.
 ![[Tavakai On Introduction 9 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: It was? Says who, then? You?
 ![[Tavakai On Introduction 9 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: So, you're the Chieftain?

 ![[Tavakai On Introduction 9 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: So... you must be the local Chieftain.
 ![[Tavakai On Introduction 9 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Oh, mate, mate. I had no idea I was talking to a Chieftain!
 ![[Tavakai On Introduction 9 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: Chieftain, eh? That'd be you, then?
 ![[Tavakai On Introduction 9 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: I am not your {mate}. But...
 ![[Tavakai On Introduction 9 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Yes. I am Tavakai, Chieftain of the Tukohama Tribe. These waters belong to the Karui. You, along with the... {Kalguurans}... are our guests. And your welcome is already wearing thin.

Ranger: What's done is done. I made the choice. That's on me.
 ![[Tavakai On Introduction 9 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: I am sorry, Chieftain. I had no idea.
 ![[Tavakai On Introduction 9 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Fate led me there, it was not a choice of my own.
 ![[Tavakai On Introduction 9 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: I knew something was wrong from the start. I just wanted to see what would happen.
 ![[Tavakai On Introduction 9 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: This must be made right. I will find and slay this {Tekaru.}
 ![[Tavakai On Introduction 9 - L18 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: The Deceiver fooled us. There was no way to know.
 ![[Tavakai On Introduction 9 - L19 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: I just go where I'm pointed. Look, not to throw little Tujen under the boat, but...
 ![[Tavakai On Introduction 9 - L20 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: Had I known it was the Raven Trickster's prison, I wouldnae have done what I did.
 ![[Tavakai On Introduction 9 - L21 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: You should have been wary. And...
 ![[Tavakai On Introduction 9 - L22 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: What stupidity falls from your mouth?
 ![[Tavakai On Introduction 9 - L23 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: It is too late for that! Besides...
 ![[Tavakai On Introduction 9 - L24 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: What? Have you hit your head?
 ![[Tavakai On Introduction 9 - L25 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: You're damn right it's on you.
 ![[Tavakai On Introduction 9 - L26 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: It is too late to be sorry.
 ![[Tavakai On Introduction 9 - L27 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: No excuse. He's a drunk. Not to be trusted! Besides...
 ![[Tavakai On Introduction 9 - L28 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Yet you did it all the same. Now we all bear the cost.
 ![[Tavakai On Introduction 9 - L29 - A1.ogg]]
