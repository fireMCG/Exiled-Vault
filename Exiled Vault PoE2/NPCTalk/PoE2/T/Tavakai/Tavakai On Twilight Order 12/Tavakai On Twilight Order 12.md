Druid: This Twilight lot on Arastas... What do ye make of 'em?
 ![[Tavakai On Twilight Order 12 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Bah. The very name Arastas sets my teeth on edge. That is {not} our name for those ancient shores. The Twilight Order has been there in some form for a very long time. There are sacred burial sites deep within the island... but they are not Karui. Other than that, we know very little about them.

Kaimana: Yes! But... we know enough to be concerned. Unlike the Kalguurans, the Order actively recruits any that will listen. Listen long enough, and you may pledge just to shut them up! Once you're recruited, you say goodbye to your old life. Goodbye to your family. Goodbye to yourself. It is worrisome, yes!

Matiki: We have lost many of our youth to their {cause}. They promise a new future. A new world. But... we do not know {how} they plan to achieve it. There is more to uncover about their motives.

Tavakai: Put simply, they may soon know the meaning of the true Way. I will not console another mother, sister or child who has lost their loved one to those wretched fools, never to hear from them again.

Ranger: If diplomacy doesn't work, I understand it.
 ![[Tavakai On Twilight Order 12 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Sounds like they've got it coming, if talking won't work.
 ![[Tavakai On Twilight Order 12 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Why not try to speak with them?
 ![[Tavakai On Twilight Order 12 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: No open conversation with them as of yet, I take it?
 ![[Tavakai On Twilight Order 12 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Have you not spoken to their elders?
 ![[Tavakai On Twilight Order 12 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: Have you tried speaking with them?
 ![[Tavakai On Twilight Order 12 - L18 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: You tried having a chat with 'em?
 ![[Tavakai On Twilight Order 12 - L19 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: And did ye try talkin' sense to 'em?
 ![[Tavakai On Twilight Order 12 - L20 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: The head of the sea serpent is hard to find in stormy seas. Their hierarchy is... confusing. Titles upon titles. It reeks of a militant structure, no matter how they try to make it look.
 ![[Tavakai On Twilight Order 12 - L21 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai On Twilight Order 12 - L21 - A2.ogg]]

Matiki: The swords give a hint or two!
 ![[Tavakai On Twilight Order 12 - L22 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: We've tried talking. I'm done with it.
 ![[Tavakai On Twilight Order 12 - L23 - A1.ogg]]

Kaimana: And not just Tavakai. I also tried. Yes.
 ![[Tavakai On Twilight Order 12 - L24 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: And me too. All I got out of it was about half a day of listening to nonsense that went in one ear... and out the other. I think {they} might not even know what they are going on about. They {do} make a good mead, though...

Druid: Not {all} bad, then.
