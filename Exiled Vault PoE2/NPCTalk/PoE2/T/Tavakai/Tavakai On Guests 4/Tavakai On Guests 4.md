# Tavakai On Guests 4

Tavakai: Yes. You are all {guests} here on these waters. Waters that have belonged to us since the Beginning of Time. Our {Way} is our identity. It is beyond life and death. The Way gave us the strength to endure all the horrors of Wraeclast. Corruption. Disease. Slavers... Ugh. Never again.

Ranger: I grew up surrounded by that lesson. Survival of the fittest.
 ![[Tavakai On Guests 4 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: My tribe survived by living in harmony... but now I'm on me own, with only me own strength.
 ![[Tavakai On Guests 4 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: We are promised a better world. But for now, it appears violence is the only answer.
 ![[Tavakai On Guests 4 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Beyond life and death? Haha! Hmm... I suppose belief is a kind of strength.
 ![[Tavakai On Guests 4 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: The Maraketh have endured many of the same woes. All that truly matters is strength. What else ensures survival?
 ![[Tavakai On Guests 4 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: I understand. As a child, my back was branded by foul hands. Some of my earliest memories are of pain. I vowed never to be weak again.

Mercenary: I can respect that. No one should kneel to the weak.
 ![[Tavakai On Guests 4 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: Folk are naught without a code to live by. I respect it.
 ![[Tavakai On Guests 4 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Then my words are not wasted on you. Now... it is your choice, and you choose to be strong!
 ![[Tavakai On Guests 4 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: It can take many forms, yes...
 ![[Tavakai On Guests 4 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Nothing does! The Maraketh know this!
 ![[Tavakai On Guests 4 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: We are promised nothing. We must make the world better for ourselves... with our own hands.
 ![[Tavakai On Guests 4 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: It is not enough to just survive! Why merely settle for that?
 ![[Tavakai On Guests 4 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Return to them! You belong to your tribe, as they do to you. The strength of the individual is nothing against the tide of many...
 ![[Tavakai On Guests 4 - L15 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai On Guests 4 - L15 - A2.ogg]]

Tavakai: Yes... I'd sooner join the Mother of Death's embrace!
 ![[Tavakai On Guests 4 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Respect is a beginning. But the code must be lived, every day - or it is nothing.
 ![[Tavakai On Guests 4 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Strength is the key! And yet here we are... Slowly but surely, outsiders forsake us. The Vaal, the Eternal Empire, and now... the Kalguurans. I thought their leader, Dannig, was true of heart... until he allowed the harvest of our sacred whale! And it was all downhill from there... Twenty years ago, we allowed only four Kalguurans to stay here... and now look at this place. Ugh.
