# Tavakai On Kanu 4

Tavakai: Kanu was always headstrong. Loud and disrespectful... all the makings of a great warrior! He threw it all away to work for the Kalguurans. We have lost many to foreign causes. That's why Ngakanu is now off limits to outsiders.

Ranger: You can't control the young. It's wrong to try.

Witch: Ideas can be more dangerous than any weapon.

Warrior: Ah, I understand now.

Druid: The boy's no coward. There's strength in him still.
 ![[Tavakai On Kanu 4 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Yes. I expected you would.
 ![[Tavakai On Kanu 4 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Perhaps... but try defending yourself with an idea.
 ![[Tavakai On Kanu 4 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Few choices are easy. But some... are right.
 ![[Tavakai On Kanu 4 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Mm. They do not know, what they do not know.
 ![[Tavakai On Kanu 4 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: It is not about control! It's about honour. Respect. Tradition.

Tavakai: Perhaps that suits you, up on your mountain. But the sea moves quickly.
 ![[Tavakai On Kanu 4 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Yes. That is my fear. A history... we shall never relive.
 ![[Tavakai On Kanu 4 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Strength he lends to the Kalguurans, not his own people.
 ![[Tavakai On Kanu 4 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: We cannot afford to lose more of our young to these {dangerous} ideas...
