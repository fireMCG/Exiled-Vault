Tavakai: He showed promise when he arrived on our shores. I saw the warrior within. But I will never forgive him for allowing the hunt of our sacred whale.

Ranger: Dannig has deeper respect for you than you give him credit. He tried to intervene but was too late.

Huntress: Aye, Dannig regrets that. But it weren't his fault. It were his bloody King who gave the order.

Monk: The Kalguuran was not to blame. He tried to stop it. You are too quick to judge.

Witch: Oh, come now. The blacksmith was too late to stop that. If you'd really like, perhaps I can bring it back to life.

Sorceress: I must tell you, Sir Dannig was not to blame. He wishes he could have stopped it.

Warrior: Dannig has spoken to me of this. He tried to stop it... but he was too late. He regrets that it ever took place.

Mercenary: It's not my place to care or say... but it wasn't his fault, mate. He tried to stop that from even happening.

Druid: He allowed no such thing. Dannig tried to stop it... but he was too late.

Tavakai: I... did not know that. Hmm. Either way, the Kalguuran monster that is Kingsmarch is too large for any one man to {fully} control.
