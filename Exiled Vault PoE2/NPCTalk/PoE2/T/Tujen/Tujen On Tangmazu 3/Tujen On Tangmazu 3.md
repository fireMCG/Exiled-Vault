Ranger: That had to have been a god. The Black Crow... The gods have many names across Wraeclast, but the Ezomytes do not know his.

Huntress: He were a God. Tangmazu. A mortal turned divine by unknown means. Nothing like our sacred Spirit.

Monk: That was a being of supreme power. It must have been a god.

Witch: You'd rather not think of the God you saw? Oh, no. No one mention the god! Or the Kalguuran will lose his little mind.

Sorceress: The tale-women tell of a cowardly god of lies... not one of ours, but Azmeri. They called him the Raven.

Warrior: He was not a First One, but there was a Deceiver among those that came after... A Black Crow. An ancient God of lies.

Mercenary: I know, mate. We don't have much of that nonsense back home neither.

Druid: He was meant to be dealt with. Locked away. But I know who that was.
The Raven Trickster. And I... the fool who freed him.
