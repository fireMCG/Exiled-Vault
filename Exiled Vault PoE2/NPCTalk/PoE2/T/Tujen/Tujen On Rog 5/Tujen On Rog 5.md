# Tujen On Rog 5

Tujen: Now there's a true friend. Me and him have been on this campaign here in Wraeclast since the start of this little venture, when it was but a lodge and a dream. Next thing you know... well, it all got away from us... ... and here we are, with a whole town somehow grown up around us.
