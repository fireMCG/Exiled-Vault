# Tujen On Dark Mists 5

Tujen: Hmm...before you set off... perhaps you could look into a little problem of ours. See, Kingsmarch trade has seen better days. Ships go out and they don't come back. And that kinda shite is bad for business.

Ranger: The water is not my home... but what do you need?
 ![[Tujen On Dark Mists 5 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: What's the problem then?
 ![[Tujen On Dark Mists 5 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Mysterious.

Witch: Dark foreboding seas! Oh I can't wait.
 ![[Tujen On Dark Mists 5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Oh dear. I feel seasick already.

Warrior: What's the cause of this?
 ![[Tujen On Dark Mists 5 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Alright. Who I gotta kill?

Tujen: A local island we call 'Journey's End' is spewing out blasted fog all over the sea, as thick as mud! The Karui know all about it, but won't seem to touch it. Somethin' has to be done.

Ranger: How can {we} get there?
 ![[Tujen On Dark Mists 5 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: But how will we fare through that fog?
 ![[Tujen On Dark Mists 5 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: If this fog is blinding... we can't make it there.
 ![[Tujen On Dark Mists 5 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Fog like a thick cold blanket. Mmm. Wait. How will we get there?
 ![[Tujen On Dark Mists 5 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: This fog will prevent us from making the journey, no?
 ![[Tujen On Dark Mists 5 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: How will we find our way through the fog?
 ![[Tujen On Dark Mists 5 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Sure. But how we gettin' there?
 ![[Tujen On Dark Mists 5 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Tujen: Makoru can do it. She's Karui, and grew up on these waters. If anyone can get you there, it's her, no doubt.
