# Tujen On Dark Mists 4

Tujen: Hmm...before you set off... perhaps you could look into a little problem of ours. See, Kingsmarch trade has seen better days. Ships go out and they don't come back. And that kinda shite is bad for business.

Tujen: A local island we call 'Journey's End' is spewing out blasted fog all over the sea, as thick as mud! The Karui know all about it, but won't seem to touch it. Somethin' has to be done.
