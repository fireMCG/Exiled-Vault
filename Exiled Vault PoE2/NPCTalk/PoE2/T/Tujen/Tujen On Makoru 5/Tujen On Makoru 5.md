# Tujen On Makoru 5

Tujen: Makoru's got something to prove. Lucky for you, she's got the talent to back it up. You won't go wrong gettin' on that ship. She's been underestimated, by my people {and} her own.

Ranger: Her own discarded her?

Huntress: Why do you fear him?
 ![[Tujen On Makoru 5 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: The Karui are brutal.
 ![[Tujen On Makoru 5 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Her tribe, I take it?
 ![[Tujen On Makoru 5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Her own people did not believe in her? Outrageous.
 ![[Tujen On Makoru 5 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: The Karui?
 ![[Tujen On Makoru 5 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: They abandon her?
 ![[Tujen On Makoru 5 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: Not like the Karui to shun their own.
 ![[Tujen On Makoru 5 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Tujen: Aye. She's left 'em behind, but she's got her people's spirit. I'm fond of the Karui. They value honour, and ancestral tales of bravery. Not just talk. For real. They live the way that us Kalguurans {claim} we do. They're wild. And free.

Ranger: They underestimate her because they don't understand her.
 ![[Tujen On Makoru 5 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: I know how {that} feels.
 ![[Tujen On Makoru 5 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Why do they underestimate her?
 ![[Tujen On Makoru 5 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Why do her own people underestimate her? She seems strong.
 ![[Tujen On Makoru 5 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I am confused. Why would they underestimate such a capable leader? She is a strong woman.
 ![[Tujen On Makoru 5 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: Why do the Karui underestimate Makoru?
 ![[Tujen On Makoru 5 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Why are they underestimating her then?
 ![[Tujen On Makoru 5 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: But why cast her aside, if she's as strong as ye say?
 ![[Tujen On Makoru 5 - L18 - A1.ogg]]

Tujen: Oh, you know how it is, in times of change. The younger ones get ideas, and the older ones try to push 'em back toward tradition. The Karui passionately follow what they call 'the Way.'
