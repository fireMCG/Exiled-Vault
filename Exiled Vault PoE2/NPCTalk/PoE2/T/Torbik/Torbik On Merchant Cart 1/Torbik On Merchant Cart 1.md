# Torbik On Merchant Cart 1

Torbik: Struck off on my own several years ago. It's tough, surviving the Vastiri without a caravan, but I like the freedom. Don't get me wrong, I miss home, but the expectations there were quite rigid. I'm hoping to get a cart full of worthwhile goods and haul it on down to the Karui archipelago. I hear there's water there, {everywhere}, as far as the eye can see... Ridiculous, right? I've gotta see it for myself.
