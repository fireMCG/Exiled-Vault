# The Hooded One On The Third Edict 3

The Hooded One: There is no doubt now in my mind. It {is} the Weapon I saw in that third mural. The forging revealed an inscription. The symbols declare it 'The instrument of the Third Edict.' It was designed for the sole purpose of cleansing Corruption... ... and destroying the Beast.

Doryani: The Third Edict? What is the meaning... of these Edicts? Perhaps it follows that the Seed was the instrument of a {Second} Edict... But why? What part of this tale are we missing? Why would any civilisation intentionally create the Seed of Corruption?
