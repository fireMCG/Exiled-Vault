# The Hooded One On Doryani 14

The Hooded One: Doryani sees the world through a different lens. We must remember that he is of a bygone era...
 ![[The Hooded One On Doryani 14 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: ... I can hear you, you know.
 ![[The Hooded One On Doryani 14 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

The Hooded One: Indeed.
 ![[The Hooded One On Doryani 14 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: And of what era are you, exactly?
 ![[The Hooded One On Doryani 14 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

The Hooded One: Older still. I have seen many civilisations rise and fall.
 ![[The Hooded One On Doryani 14 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: We all have our differences.
 ![[The Hooded One On Doryani 14 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Yes... fight!
 ![[The Hooded One On Doryani 14 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Must I listen to squabble?
 ![[The Hooded One On Doryani 14 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: You are both equally questionable.
 ![[The Hooded One On Doryani 14 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Hey now... Break it up.
 ![[The Hooded One On Doryani 14 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Please. We must remain calm.
 ![[The Hooded One On Doryani 14 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Heh. I'd pay money to watch you two brawl it out.
 ![[The Hooded One On Doryani 14 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: Aye, you're both as old as stone. Let's not quarrel over it.
 ![[The Hooded One On Doryani 14 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

The Hooded One: It is a strange feeling, meeting someone so gifted in sciences I unintentionally brought to the world. All of Vaal technology and advancements, derived from my ultimate mistake...
 ![[The Hooded One On Doryani 14 - L14 - A1.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One On Doryani 14 - L14 - A2.ogg]]

Doryani: You call the Beast a mistake? On this, I do not agree. The gods were nothing but monstrous tyrants. The power of Corruption allowed humanity to seize back control of their destiny!
 ![[The Hooded One On Doryani 14 - L15 - A1.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One On Doryani 14 - L15 - A2.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One On Doryani 14 - L15 - A3.ogg]]

The Hooded One: And what did you do with that control? In your experiments, I saw death. Dismemberment. A living nightmare.
 ![[The Hooded One On Doryani 14 - L16 - A1.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One On Doryani 14 - L16 - A2.ogg]]

Doryani: A means to an end. They were all willing sacrifices.
 ![[The Hooded One On Doryani 14 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

The Hooded One: That is, somehow, even more frightening. The zealotry. The fervor. I've seen it all too often... a kind of madness, seemingly fundamental to mankind.
 ![[The Hooded One On Doryani 14 - L18 - A1.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One On Doryani 14 - L18 - A2.ogg]]

Doryani: Perhaps, but it was their choice to make. They gave themselves in the hopes of saving our people. My only regret is that I failed.
 ![[The Hooded One On Doryani 14 - L19 - A1.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One On Doryani 14 - L19 - A2.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One On Doryani 14 - L19 - A3.ogg]]

The Hooded One: Oh to bear but {one} regret...
 ![[The Hooded One On Doryani 14 - L20 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: One day, all regrets will be cast aside. We will put things right.
 ![[The Hooded One On Doryani 14 - L21 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: And this is what I get for trying to make small talk.
 ![[The Hooded One On Doryani 14 - L22 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Regrets are what shape us. Learnings observed about ourselves. No one is perfect.
 ![[The Hooded One On Doryani 14 - L23 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Regrets are useless. We have to move forward. Best you both try to as well.
 ![[The Hooded One On Doryani 14 - L24 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: I've certainly made some mistakes I wish I could take back. But we must accept them and move on.
 ![[The Hooded One On Doryani 14 - L25 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: The burdened mind drags itself down. The past is behind us.
 ![[The Hooded One On Doryani 14 - L26 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Oof, sorry I asked.
 ![[The Hooded One On Doryani 14 - L27 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: Regret's a root ye cannae cut. Best learn to grow around it.
