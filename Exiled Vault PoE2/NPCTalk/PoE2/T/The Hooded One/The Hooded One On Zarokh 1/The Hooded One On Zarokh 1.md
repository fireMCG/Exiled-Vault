# The Hooded One On Zarokh 1

The Hooded One: I have long considered it a mistake to bind souls to {baryas}. Not only is the punishment egregious, but it allows them to persist long past their time. Zarokh achieved many great things during the war against the Abyssals, but his ambition outgrew his sense. Now, he remains to torment us, when he should have passed from this world long ago. He worked closely with the tale-women of the era, and stole their wisdom, becoming the first Chronomancer. If he has lent his powers to Azmadi, this will not be a simple contest of strength. It will be far more dangerous than that.
