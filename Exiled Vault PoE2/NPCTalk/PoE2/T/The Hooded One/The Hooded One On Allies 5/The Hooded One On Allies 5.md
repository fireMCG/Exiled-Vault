# The Hooded One On Allies 5

The Hooded One: Now, we need allies. I believe we have earned good will throughout Wraeclast. It is time to call upon those debts. One last journey, recruiting any who will join us, before we assault Oriath. The Karui are already with us. We should call upon the Ezomytes and the Maraketh.
