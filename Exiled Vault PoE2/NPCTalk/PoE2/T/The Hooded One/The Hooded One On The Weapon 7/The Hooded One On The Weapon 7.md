Doryani: From what I've seen, I don't believe the Weapon was broken apart. It was never fully completed at all. I have only ever seen it portrayed in pieces. The third mural, the one you saw, {must} have been an instruction. It is my belief that the creators of the Weapon were... interrupted.

The Hooded One: I was too young to remember much. I was among the Azmeri when it happened. But they did tell stories... I recall tales of... a great fire, a great wasting...

Doryani: {You} were alive for {that?} The historical record... it's always been conjecture...!
