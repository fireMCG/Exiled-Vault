# The Hooded One On The Weapon 5

The Hooded One: The more I consider it, the more I believe I've seen a depiction of the Weapon. Especially now that I can study the piece in Doryani's possession...

Doryani: A depiction? Where? The scraps I know, I learned from incredibly ancient ruins.

The Hooded One: Yes... when I consulted the ancient being Kalandra, she told me where to find the Seed of Corruption... She was cryptic, and said that it already belonged to me. That it always had. I can still only guess what she meant... In the ruins where the Seed was sealed, I saw carvings on the wall. It was a message, left for anyone who might follow in the eons to come. A series of giant murals. The first was broken, but the second depicted the creation of the Seed. The third mural portrayed the Seed's destruction. At the time, I thought it was a warning. Now, I see the Weapon was depicted quite literally, being driven into the Seed. It might not have been a warning. It might have been... {instructions.}

Doryani: This confirms my hypothesis. The Weapon is the key to destroying the Beast. We must find and reassemble it, no matter the cost.
