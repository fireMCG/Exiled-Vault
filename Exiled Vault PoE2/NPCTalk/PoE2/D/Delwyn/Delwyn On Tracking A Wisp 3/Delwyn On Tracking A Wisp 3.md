# Delwyn On Tracking A Wisp 3

Followin' 'em ain't as simple as just keepin' pace. Chase a wisp, you'll find every beast it touches turns meaner, stronger—more ferocious than before.

Followin' 'em ain't as simple as just keepin' pace. Chase a wisp, and you'll find every beast it touches turns meaner, stronger—more ferocious than before. Seems like the {rathin} in 'em don't take kindly to the Spirit's presence—like a fire ragin' hotter when the wind picks up. Regardless, the Spirit always settles on one in particular—that's the real threat—but don't think the rest'll be easy pickings, neither.

Huntress: Every beast? Even those it don't possess?

Aye. Seems like the {rathin} in 'em don't take kindly to the Spirit's presence—like a fire ragin' hotter when the wind picks up. Regardless, the Spirit always settles on one in particular—that's the real threat—but don't go ignorin' the rest, neither.
