# Delwyn On Doryani 1

Delwyn: Some call him a genius. Others, a monster. The truth is usually somewhere in between. Me? I say power like his comes with a cost... and it's never the one wieldin' it who pays. Remember that the next time you go thinkin' you're on the same side.

Delwyn: So... you've thrown in with Doryani. Can't say I saw that comin'. You always did walk to the beat o' your own drum. Just hope you know what you're doin'. Men like him... they make poor enemies. And even worse allies.
