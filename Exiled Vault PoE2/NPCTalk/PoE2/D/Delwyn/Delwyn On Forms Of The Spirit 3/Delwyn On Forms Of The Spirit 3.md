# Delwyn On Forms Of The Spirit 3

Most wisps are small flickers o' the Spirit, drawn to {rathin} like moths to flame. But some... some burn brighter, and seek out only the strongest. You'll know 'em by their orange glow—bright as embers in the dark. They're not easy to bring down... but I reckon you can handle yerself.
