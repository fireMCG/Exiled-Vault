# Delwyn On Azmeri Traditions 5

We always kept to ourselves—never troubled the world, and it never troubled us. Least, not 'til our ancestors took in the Vaal, and folk still bicker over whether that were a mistake.

We Azmeri always kept to ourselves—never troubled the world, and it never troubled us. Least, not 'til our ancestors took in the Vaal, and folk still bicker over whether that were a mistake. But that were then. Now, the Spirit itself calls on us to look beyond our own. Who are we to ignore its will?

Huntress: I've no love for the Vaal, but if not for their virtue gems, our village would be a smolderin' ruin right now.

Huntress: You think that preferable?
 ![[Delwyn On Azmeri Traditions 5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Nay. Just a statement o' fact. But that were then. Now, the Spirit calls on us to look beyond our own. Who are we to ignore its will?
