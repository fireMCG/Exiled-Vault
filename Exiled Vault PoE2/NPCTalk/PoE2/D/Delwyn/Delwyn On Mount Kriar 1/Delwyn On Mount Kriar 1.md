# Delwyn On Mount Kriar 1

Delwyn: You crested Mount Kriar and lived to tell the tale. Few can claim that - fewer still who ain't Azmeri. I'm sure your path now leads elsewhere... but know you'll always be welcome here.

Delwyn: There was a time I thought I'd never see you on these mountains again. But Elders be damned - you came back, and stood atop Mount Kriar besides. Whatever road calls you next, know that my hearth will always be open to you.
