# Delwyn On The Spirit 7

I've never known the Spirit to manifest itself so openly. Heard tell of it, aye... but even in the stories, it weren't like this.

I've never known the Spirit to manifest itself so openly. Heard tell of it, aye... but even in the stories, it weren't like this. Our elders spoke of a time when the Spirit moved among us, seekin' out {rathin}—Corruption, in the modern tongue—and guidin' our hunters to it so they could cleanse the land. Seems it's doin' the same now... but more often. More urgent. {Rathin's} spreadin'. The Spirit's callin' us to act. Question is—will you answer?

Huntress: You think I don't know that?

I know you do. Just weren't sure you still cared.

Huntress: 'Course I care. What do you think it means?
 ![[Delwyn On The Spirit 7 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

That's what I aim to find out. In years past, the Spirit sought out {rathin}—led our hunters to it, so they could root it out.

Huntress: That's no small task. Far greater than chasing wisps.

Aye. The Spirit's no fool. It's drawn to the worst of 'em—the powerful ones. Might be worth your while to hunt such marks. If you're lookin' to redeem yourself... here's your chance.
