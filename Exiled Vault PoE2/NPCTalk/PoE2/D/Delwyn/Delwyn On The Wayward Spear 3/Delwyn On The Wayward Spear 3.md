# Delwyn On The Wayward Spear 3

Delwyn: Never seen such a woeful misunderstandin' of the Spirit in all my days. Don't know what possessed her to think she were doin' its work. Spirit never asked me to kill an innocent. And if it did, well... I'd have to question me own sanity.

Delwyn: Never thought I'd see the Spirit's name used to justify such butchery. Folk like us know it'd never ask for the blood of an innocent. If it ever did... well, I'd wonder if I'd lost me mind entirely.

Delwyn: Don't feel good, puttin' someone down - but don't lose any sleep over it.

Delwyn: Don't feel good to kill one o' your own - but don't lose any sleep over it.

Delwyn: Truth is, a lotta people are dead because o' her... and now, no more will be.
