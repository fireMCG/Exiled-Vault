# Delwyn On The Wayward Spear 1

Delwyn: I know the one. Once a proud hunter, now lost to madness. Put her kin to the spear 'cause 'the Spirit told her to' - or so she says... More likely the Snake. If you could deal with her, you'd be doin' us all a favour... and probably her, as well.

Delwyn: Wayward is right. Once a fine hunter... now she's turned her spear on her own. Says the Spirit told her to do it. You and I both know that's not true. Sounds more like the Snake if you ask me... If you face her, make it quick. That's not the Spirit's path she's walkin'... and hasn't been for a long time.
