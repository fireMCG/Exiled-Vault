# Delwyn On The Snake 1

Delwyn: I am troubled by stories o' deception... by voices that are not the Spirit. Is there someone out there misleading us? Whisperin' in our ears, leading us to our dooms? It sounds like our stories of the Snake, but of that, I know little. Hasn't troubled us for generations. An Elder would know better than I.
