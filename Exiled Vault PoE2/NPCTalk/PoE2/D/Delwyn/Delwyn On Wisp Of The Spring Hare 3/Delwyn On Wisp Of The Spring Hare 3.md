# Delwyn On Wisp Of The Spring Hare 3

Reckon that were a Wisp o' the Spring Hare. Wily lil' things, they are—devilishly so. Any beast they inhabit's got a chance o' springin' straight back to life after you've put 'em down... as if there weren't enough o' that goin' around already.

Huntress: Lovely. Just what this place needs—more things what won't stay dead.

Aye—seems unlike the Spirit, truth be told. But who am I to question?
