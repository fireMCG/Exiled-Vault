# Delwyn On Introduction 3

Spirit's breath... It's you. Weren't sure I'd ever see you again after... well, you know. Some said you were dead. Part o' me almost wished it—easier than wonderin' where you went... or how to reckon with what you did.

Here to hunt, are ya? That makes two of us. Name's Delwyn. See that there? No, your eyes don't deceive ya. That... is the Spirit. Or at least, a form of it. Don't worry—it means for us to follow. Approach, and the hunt begins.

Huntress: You know why I did it—to save our people.
 ![[Delwyn On Introduction 3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Aye... and save 'em you did. Just wish it hadn't cost you—us—everythin'. But what's done is done. Now's your chance to make it right. The Spirit is near, or at least... a form of it. Approach, and the hunt begins.
