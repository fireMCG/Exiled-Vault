# Delwyn On Introduction 1

Delwyn: Welcome to Mount Kriar - not the friendliest peak in the Ranges. Keep your footin', keep your wits... and you might just leave with both in-tact. If not, well... these slopes are littered with folk who made the same mistake.

Delwyn: Look at you, back in the Ranges... never thought I'd see the day. I won't tell you to watch your step - you know the perils of these peaks better than most. Doubt the Elders would be happy to know you're back. But I won't be the one to tell 'em.
