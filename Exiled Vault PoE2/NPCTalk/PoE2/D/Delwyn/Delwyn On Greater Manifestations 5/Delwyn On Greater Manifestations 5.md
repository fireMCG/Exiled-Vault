# Delwyn On Greater Manifestations 5

We've always hunted beasts infused with the Spirit—you know that as well as I do. But lately... I've seen wisps unlike the rest. Older, maybe. Stronger. More potent with the Spirit's power.

We Azmeri hunt beasts infused with the Spirit. Always have. But... seems there are some wisps that are different. Older, maybe. More potent with the Spirit's power. These are the ones I track—they seek out only the most Corrupted o' beasts. I've seen more and more of 'em lately. Can't say why. But the Spirit clearly means to tell us summat... and I'll be damned if I don't listen.

Huntress: Think the Spirit's trying to tell us somethin'?

I do. And I'll be damned if I don't listen... Question is, will you?

Huntress: I'm here, aren't I?
 ![[Delwyn On Greater Manifestations 5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Aye. That you are.
