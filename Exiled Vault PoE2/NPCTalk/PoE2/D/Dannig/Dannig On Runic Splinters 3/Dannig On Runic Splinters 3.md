# Dannig On Runic Splinters 3

Dannig: You've found a Runic Splinter, eh? Let me take a look. Ah, yes! This is a sliver of the Triskelion Flame itself! Our first proof it truly is on Wraeclast!

Dannig: It's not {great} that a piece came off, but it's tiny, and the artefact itself was quite large. Nothing I can't repair. If you find enough of these, I could use their runic signature to determine the location of the Flame. These might lead us straight there!
