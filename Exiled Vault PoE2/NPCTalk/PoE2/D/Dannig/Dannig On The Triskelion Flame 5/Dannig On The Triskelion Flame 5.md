# Dannig On The Triskelion Flame 5

Dannig: The most powerful artefact in our known tales was brought to this continent by the first expedition thousands of years ago. The songs tell of it incinerating evil, purifying tainted fields, and warding off those of ill intent.

Ranger: That sounds like our fable of the Runic Triquetra. If it was actually real, it would make a tremendous difference.

Huntress: Our stories mention your people havin' that. It'd be a powerful weapon in this fight.

Monk: This would be a fortuitous time for such an artefact to resurface.

Witch: I'm intrigued. That thing sounds rather useful for our current situation.

Sorceress: I can incinerate evil myself, but purification... Wraeclast could use that.
 ![[Dannig On The Triskelion Flame 5 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: If Ogham had possessed something like that... well, we still need it, even now.
 ![[Dannig On The Triskelion Flame 5 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Sounds like a fae tale, but I'll take anything, considering what we're up against.

Druid: If it truly purifies... then it belongs in these blighted lands.
 ![[Dannig On The Triskelion Flame 5 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: My thoughts exactly. I still intend to get out there - I just get bogged down by the work of running Kingsmarch...

Ranger: Life is too short to live it passively.
 ![[Dannig On The Triskelion Flame 5 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Aye, you're an Elder now... no offense.

Monk: All paths have detours. You should get back on the trail.

Witch: Let the weaklings {administrate.} Stop wasting time.
 ![[Dannig On The Triskelion Flame 5 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: The burden of leadership usually falls on the unwilling. It is a sign of your virtue. I admire you for this.
 ![[Dannig On The Triskelion Flame 5 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: Trust me. The hour is always later than you think.
 ![[Dannig On The Triskelion Flame 5 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: If there's one thing that grinds a man down more than anything else, it's paperwork.
 ![[Dannig On The Triskelion Flame 5 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: Life at a desk's no life at all. Best ye get back out there.
 ![[Dannig On The Triskelion Flame 5 - L18 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: One day, there will be a glorious return! One day, we Grand Four will finish our quest, and perhaps do a little saving of this fair Wraeclast. Yes. One day. Soon.
