# Dannig On Virtue Gems 3

Dannig: We've had twenty years on Wraeclast, and those gems you use continue to perplex me. Clearly, they grant you mystical abilities, but they simply don't do anything in the hands of a Kalguuran.

Ranger: That speaks to deeper mysteries in your nature. You sure?

Huntress: Reckon you're lucky, then. They bring evil. You sure it's never worked for ya?

Monk: Hmm... your presence does feel different to me. Are you sure it has never once worked?

Witch: What, really? I can't believe I'm saying this, but that seems rather... unfair.

Sorceress: I know it's impolite to ask this of a strong man, but did you make sure you... properly focused your will?

Warrior: Are you sure? Even with focused will?

Mercenary: Well good on ya for holding your own. If you're this good {without} gems, just imagine...

Druid: They've never worked for ye? Not even a glimmer?

Dannig: Believe me, I've tried. We have our own methods of mystical power, to be fair, but your gems remain an enigma. Somehow, I suspect the power is actually inside you, and these 'virtue gems' are just the particular way you believe the world works. I'm no priest, though, so take my opinion for what it's worth.
