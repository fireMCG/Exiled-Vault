# Dannig On The Karui 3

Dannig: Our trade with the Karui fluctuates. There are so many tribes with different beliefs and different propensities... some days, we're all profiting. Other days, they're raiding our shipping lanes.

Dannig: The Tukohama Tribe, the largest in the region, welcomed us at first. We got along very well. Too well. When some of their younger members became interested in Kingsmarch, their Chieftain, Tavakai, began to see us a little differently.
