# Dannig On The Expedition 3

Dannig: Kingsmarch is actually our second attempt at settling on Wraeclast. Our first expedition, thousands of years back, was mysteriously lost.

Ranger: Really? Are you sure?

Huntress: The Azmeri remember. The stories say we came to their aid, but it was too late. What happened?

Monk: History lost outweighs history remembered. Do you have any idea what happened?

Witch: Typical Wraeclast. What happened?

Warrior: What happened to them?

Mercenary: Their mistake was trying the mainland. Probably a tragic tale, that. What happened?

Druid: No mystery there. Wraeclast swallows folk whole. Or d'ye think it was somethin' else?

Dannig: That's why we came here twenty years ago, to find out... and we also sought the artefact of power our forebears brought with them to Wraeclast. It has become my life's work: the search for the Triskelion Flame!
