# Dannig On Introduction 5

Dannig: Hmm... what do we have here?
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 5 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Precisely what I'd like to know.
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 5 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Aye. That's what {I'm} wonderin'.
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 5 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Enlighten me, Kalguuran.
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 5 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: That's what you're here to tell me.
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I was wondering the same. Let us think about this.
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 5 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: I hoped you could tell {me}.
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 5 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Cut to the chase, mate.
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 5 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: Haven't the foggiest. What d'ye make of all this?
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 5 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: Makeshift lodgings... markers... Yes. This looks like Gwennen's handiwork. She is still pursuing our grand quest, after all. But... she didn't finish what she started here. How odd.

Ranger: Where do you think she is now?
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 5 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Seems she ain't here to speak to why.
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 5 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: What do you think became of Gwennen?
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 5 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Oh my, is she dead? Where's her body?
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 5 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: We must remain hopeful. Perhaps she just became distracted.
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 5 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: What stopped her?
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 5 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Left without the treasure... Not a good sign.
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 5 - L17 - A1.ogg]] ![[Dannig On Introduction 5 - L17 - A2.ogg]]

Druid: Not one to leave a job half-done, then?
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 5 - L18 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: I'm sure she had her reasons to cut and run. There's all manner of monstrosities out here! In any case, it seems she left us some clues as to what's in the area... When you're ready, let's see what we can unearth. Place the first explosive and we'll get started.
