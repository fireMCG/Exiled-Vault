# Dannig On Runes 3

Dannig: The runes on our armour essentially capture and shape starlight. Sounds poetic, but don't be fooled. The smiths of the Kalguur turned these runes toward killing work long ago, as soon as we discovered we could compel arrows to find their mark and blades to bite deeper.

Huntress: The Spirit has never spoken to us of such things. These runes, do they really do all that?

Monk: Some of our teachings mention such runes, but they suggest avoiding them. Do runes really hold power of that sort?

Witch: I'm always interested in learning a new thing or two. Can runes really do that?

Druid: That's no small claim. Can runes truly do all that?

Dannig: All that, and more. The greatest smiths became known as artificers, and produced work of singular genius. I'm not quite there yet, but it's only a matter of time and determination.
