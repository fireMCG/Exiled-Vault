# Dannig On Introduction 6

Dannig: Ah, a Sorceress in Kingsmarch! What a strange sight. I've heard tales of your kind. My name is Dannig. I am the humble leader of this fair port... and its smith.
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 6 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: A Witch in Kingsmarch! Never a good omen. Dark times ahead, I take it.
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 6 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: Ah, a fellow blacksmith! You and I must share tales of ancestral bravery over an ale one of these days. I am Dannig, the smith and leader of this fair port.
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 6 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: Well, well, a Trarthan! Greetings, Mercenary. You'll find plenty of work here in Kingsmarch, if you're so inclined. I'm Dannig, the smith and leader of this fair port. You may come to me for your equipment needs.
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 6 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: Welcome to Kingsm—
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 6 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: Hail. Welcome to Kingsmarch. I am Dannig, the smith and leader of this fair port town.
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 6 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: A Monk! Incredible. Monks are a true rarity in Kalguur these days, but that was not always the case. I am interested in learning about your beliefs.
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 6 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: A Druid, in the flesh! Pardon my surprise, wise one. My people once had an order of Druids long ago. You have my utmost respect. I'm Dannig. Welcome to Kingsmarch!
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 6 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Oh... I am pleased to meet you, Lord Dannig. You are so... tall. Hmm, I must know... what kind of smithing is that? It's like none I've ever seen.
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 6 - L9 - A1.ogg]] ![[Dannig On Introduction 6 - L9 - A2.ogg]]

Witch: If I have my way... then yes.
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 6 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: I've been away from the flame too long. I could use a bit of home. And that ale.
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 6 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: You get enough Trarthans here you recognise one on sight?
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 6 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: I know that kind of fake smile. No need for blustering introductions. I'm not here to make friends.
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 6 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Greetings, Dannig. I'm a mountainborn, of the Azmeri... or rather, I {was}.
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 6 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: The Dreamer guides all who are willing to see.
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 6 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: Yer kind had Druids?
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 6 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: Observant! Yes, I'm a bit more than a blacksmith. I am also skilled in runecraft.
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 6 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: Oh? Planning to bring doom and death to us all, are you? Just another day in Wraeclast.
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 6 - L18 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: You are most welcome at my forge any time. If you're around long enough, I'll even teach you the art of runecraft. Takes a couple years to learn, though.
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 6 - L19 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: We've had one or two show up over the years... caused us a fair amount of trouble. You're not still involved in the Death Trades, are you?
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 6 - L20 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: It's not entirely fake. I'm just getting tired as the years wear on, you know?
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 6 - L21 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: Ouch. That's a pain I recognise. You know, we can't exactly go home, either. If you ever want to grab an ale and talk about it, feel free to stop by.
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 6 - L22 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: The Dreamer? Is that one of Wraeclast's 'gods?'
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 6 - L23 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: Yes. The Druids of the Broken Circle. Their tales are quite extensive, albeit ancient. 
Gronel Starseer, Smalon Thickett, Avon Bruhn... all very illustrious stories in their own right.
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 6 - L24 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Runecraft. Oh, it sounds like such beautiful sorcery. Do tell me its tale.
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 6 - L25 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: I suppose I do need to save the world before I conquer it.
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 6 - L26 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: If I survive the coming days, that would be an intriguing challenge.
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 6 - L27 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: No more than the next weapon-for-hire.
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 6 - L28 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Such is the way of things.
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 6 - L29 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: I might do just that.
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 6 - L30 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: No. But we can talk about that another time. I am compelled to continue on with haste.
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 6 - L31 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: I've no use for names. Tell me how they lived.
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 6 - L32 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: Oh, it's not sorcery. It's science, taught to me by priests in my younger days. But enough about me. You're as far from home as we are... more or less. We should exchange tales over an ale sometime soon!
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 6 - L33 - A1.ogg]] ![[Dannig On Introduction 6 - L33 - A2.ogg]]

Dannig: I thought so. Let me know when you begin your {'evil crusade'} and perhaps I'll get up an hour early to stop you.
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 6 - L34 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: Then it's all settled. Welcome to Kingsmarch!
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 6 - L35 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: Fair enough.
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 6 - L36 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: So it is. Well, I'm the smith here, as you can tell. If you need anything, let me know.
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 6 - L37 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: Of course. Right. Uh, this is Kingsmarch, I am Dannig, smith and leader of this fair port town. Come to me for your equipment needs.
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 6 - L38 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: I'm always up for a tale or two. And an ale or two! Let's meet at the tavern sometime.
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 6 - L39 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: It's a date.
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 6 - L40 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: I will.
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 6 - L41 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: I shall.
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 6 - L42 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: Ale, ye say? I'll see ye there.
 ![[Dannig On Introduction 6 - L43 - A1.ogg]]
