# Dannig On Realmgate 1

Dannig: You've collected enough Runic Splinters for me to track the Triskelion Flame's unique signature! I've mapped it out. Use these in the Realmgate to open the path. If I was twenty years younger, I'd go with you, but too many people rely on me now. It's up to you, then. Gird yourself, hero. You're about to make history!
