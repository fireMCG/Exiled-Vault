# Doryani On Cuachic Vault 4

Doryani: Before us stands Mount Kriar, the most isolated peak in the Azmeri Ranges. At its summit, you will find the Cuachic Vault. There is no predicting the state of those within. If their discipline and loyalty endure after all these generations, they will know us by a certain phrase. Tell them, 'the time of the sparrow has come.'

Doryani: If they will not listen, I will come to assist you. Remember, subdue them, but do not kill them. They will fight for us, one way or another.
