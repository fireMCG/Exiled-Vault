# Doryani On Murals 3

Doryani: I must concur with... the Hooded One. Someone intentionally carved information meant to be discovered in the future. To do such a thing, they must have believed that their civilisation might be endangered. However, the most important clues I found were done differently. Hand carvings. We found them in this region. The stones depicted pieces of the Weapon being thrown into the sea.

Druid: So they sought to bury it... but why?

Doryani: Their reasoning was unclear. But from what I saw, it was thrown not by soldiers, but by a woman. A scientist... ... and I have no idea who she was.
