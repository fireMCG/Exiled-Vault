# Doryani On The Mission 39

Doryani: Yes... through that gateway lies the royal temple, on the day of the Cataclysm.

Warrior: You intend to slay your own Queen, don't you?
 ![[Doryani On The Mission 39 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: Would you not do whatever it takes to save your own?
 ![[Doryani On The Mission 39 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: Yes. And I did. What do you suggest?
 ![[Doryani On The Mission 39 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: So there'll be two of me running around the Vaal empire? One here, one in Utzaal?
 ![[Doryani On The Mission 39 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: Yes... make sure not to meet yourself.
 ![[Doryani On The Mission 39 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Probably for the best. I doubt we'd get along. What's the plan, then?
 ![[Doryani On The Mission 39 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Do you believe we can change what happened?
 ![[Doryani On The Mission 39 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: It'll be like entering a tale... but can the ending be changed?
 ![[Doryani On The Mission 39 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: I do not know. Truly... but you, tale-woman, you have a special relationship with the element Time, do you not?
 ![[Doryani On The Mission 39 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: I do not know. But we have to try.
 ![[Doryani On The Mission 39 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Yes... there may be a chance. I will do my best.
 ![[Doryani On The Mission 39 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: And I suppose you'll be wantin' me to dish out a bit o' violence?
 ![[Doryani On The Mission 39 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: I'd be disappointed if you didn't.
 ![[Doryani On The Mission 39 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Heh. What's the plan?
 ![[Doryani On The Mission 39 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Is this wise? I know what you're thinking.
 ![[Doryani On The Mission 39 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: Wise, perhaps not. Necessary... yes.
 ![[Doryani On The Mission 39 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: This seems like a bad idea.
 ![[Doryani On The Mission 39 - L18 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: Yes, it is. It's a very bad idea.
 ![[Doryani On The Mission 39 - L19 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Just so long as we're clear. Now, what do you have in mind?
 ![[Doryani On The Mission 39 - L20 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Tryin' to get me killed, are ya?
 ![[Doryani On The Mission 39 - L21 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: Not killed – I mean to change what happened that day. If such a thing is even possible.
 ![[Doryani On The Mission 39 - L22 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Fine. Tell me what needs doin'.
 ![[Doryani On The Mission 39 - L23 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: If we can stop Atziri... could other things be changed?
 ![[Doryani On The Mission 39 - L24 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: If we manage to defy the rules of existence once... twice seems just as likely.
 ![[Doryani On The Mission 39 - L25 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: Then tell me what needs doin'.

Doryani: Enter the gateway. Find Xipocado. He is the only one who can give us access to the Queen's chambers. If he is not willing, then bring me his personal blood medallion. It may suffice. Everything I know as a man of science tells me the past cannot be changed... but I am still asking you to try. Not for me, but for the millions of lives at stake.

Alva: We'll do our best. In the meantime, we can get our hands on Atziri's considerable assets!
 ![[Doryani On The Mission 39 - L37 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: {Excuse me?}
 ![[Doryani On The Mission 39 - L38 - A1.ogg]]

Alva: Her legendary treasure vaults!
 ![[Doryani On The Mission 39 - L39 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: Oh... of course. Do as you wish in that regard. It hardly matters now.
 ![[Doryani On The Mission 39 - L40 - A1.ogg]]

Alva: That's what I like to hear. Let's go!
