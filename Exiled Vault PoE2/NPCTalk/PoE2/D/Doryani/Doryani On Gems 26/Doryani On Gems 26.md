# Doryani On Gems 26

Doryani: Each gem we mined seemed to take after a particular portion of a myth or belief. Abilities our people believed our gods to possess. Arakaali's poison. Kopec's fire. Never anything new. Never the unknown.

Templar: [DNT]

Ranger: Ah, so what people believe becomes fragmented... crystallised...

Doryani: Precisely.

Sorceress: I see the danger. What mortal could turn down the power of the gods?
 ![[Doryani On Gems 26 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: The strength of the gods, lyin' around in forests and valleys... free for anyone to pick up and use to kill each other.

Doryani: Our royalty became addicted to the power of these gems long ago. In that sense, we have always been doomed.

Monk: Perhaps gems could be seen as... rewards. The fruits of our faith.

Doryani: The Beast is merely a mechanism. The gods have nothing to do with it.
 ![[Doryani On Gems 26 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Sin grew the Beast. He is a god... and it is our beliefs that shaped and formed these gems.
 ![[Doryani On Gems 26 - L18 - A1.ogg]]
