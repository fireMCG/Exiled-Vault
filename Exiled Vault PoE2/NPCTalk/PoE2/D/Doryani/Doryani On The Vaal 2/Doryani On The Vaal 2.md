Witch: Come now, Doryani. You clearly want to take back the Weapon to save your people. I'm not stupid.

Monk: What of your people? Will you try to save them with the Weapon, when this is over?

Mercenary: Well, how about the Vaal? We got this Third Edict thing - can we save them, too?

Druid: Speak plain - when this is over, will ye wield the Weapon to save yer people?

Doryani: I cannot. Unfortunately, that is not how Time works. Everything one {knows} will happen, {did} happen. This is the one case where ignorance can be a scientist's greatest asset. I must learn as little about history as possible while I am in this era...
