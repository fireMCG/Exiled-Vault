# Doryani On Fate Of The Vaal 15

Doryani: My Patron warned that Fate would torment me. And yet, even knowing the futility of my efforts, I am compelled to try anyway. We are so close. We have access to Atziri in the moments before the Cataclysm! I will try again and again, no matter how long it takes.
