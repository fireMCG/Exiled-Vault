# Doryani On The Cradle 22

Doryani: Atziri has long been obsessed with the Beast, ever since I discovered its hiding place in the mountain... She would divert sacrifices to the dig site. Feed subjects to it, just to watch the process. She seemed to believe she was winning its favour, like a master earning the loyalty of a pet.

Marauder: [DNT]

Witch: ...and was she right?

Doryani: It is alive, but I don't believe it feels the way even basic animals do...
 ![[Doryani On The Cradle 22 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Can the Beast truly be tamed in such a way?
 ![[Doryani On The Cradle 22 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: Can the Beast obey a master?
 ![[Doryani On The Cradle 22 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: I don't believe it can ever truly be controlled.

Shadow: [DNT]

Huntress: Not all creatures feel things the way we do.
 ![[Doryani On The Cradle 22 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: Indeed. I found no evidence that the Beast is capable of such a bond.

Duelist: [DNT]

Doryani: [DNT]

Doryani: I studied it myself, under the guise of studying it for her. I delayed wherever I could, buying time. But in the end, I was forced to devise the Red Communion. She wouldn't let me return to Utzaal unless I completed its design.

Warrior: So this is all your fault?
 ![[Doryani On The Cradle 22 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Aw, see. That's where you burnt the stew. It's on you.
 ![[Doryani On The Cradle 22 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: Partially. History will likely remember me as a monster, but it could not be avoided.

Monk: Did you try to sabotage what you gave her?
 ![[Doryani On The Cradle 22 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: I tried... but she had her loyal Architects verify my work.
 ![[Doryani On The Cradle 22 - L18 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: She didn't trust you?
 ![[Doryani On The Cradle 22 - L19 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: Atziri trusts no one.
 ![[Doryani On The Cradle 22 - L20 - A1.ogg]]

Templar: [DNT]

Ranger: You were an animal caught in a trap, gnawing off its own leg to survive...
