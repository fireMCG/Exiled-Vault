# Doryani On Locus Of Corruption 31

Doryani: Look around you. This is the height of progress. Our civilisation was built on the channeling and control of Corruption, and nowhere was it mastered so perfectly as this chamber.

Warrior: I've only ever seen Corruption {ruin} good weapons.
 ![[Doryani On Locus Of Corruption 31 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: Perhaps it's more art than science.
 ![[Doryani On Locus Of Corruption 31 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: What did that entail, exactly?
 ![[Doryani On Locus Of Corruption 31 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: We delved into the very secrets of existence here, and even began altering reality itself, in a limited fashion...
 ![[Doryani On Locus Of Corruption 31 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: That sounds... oddly familiar.
 ![[Doryani On Locus Of Corruption 31 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: Hmmm... like the Precursors themselves, perhaps we were already on a doomed path...
 ![[Doryani On Locus Of Corruption 31 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: The Maraketh are honour-bound to seek out and destroy Corruption such as this.
 ![[Doryani On Locus Of Corruption 31 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: Perhaps you should think carefully before you reject the power Corruption offers.
 ![[Doryani On Locus Of Corruption 31 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I said 'the Maraketh.' I left before I took the oath.
 ![[Doryani On Locus Of Corruption 31 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: In such a place, I can understand how such power seduced your people.
 ![[Doryani On Locus Of Corruption 31 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: It is as beautiful as it is dangerous.
 ![[Doryani On Locus Of Corruption 31 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Lotta {rathin}, all in one place. Gives me shivers. Spirit once cut me off just for usin' a gem.
 ![[Doryani On Locus Of Corruption 31 - L13 - A1.ogg]] ![[Doryani On Locus Of Corruption 31 - L13 - A2.ogg]]

Doryani: Best not touch anything in here, then.
 ![[Doryani On Locus Of Corruption 31 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Is not very impressive. Quite dim in here.
 ![[Doryani On Locus Of Corruption 31 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: You don't see the intense red light?
 ![[Doryani On Locus Of Corruption 31 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Looks grey to me.
 ![[Doryani On Locus Of Corruption 31 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: I never know if you're being serious or not.
 ![[Doryani On Locus Of Corruption 31 - L18 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Dead serious, mate. Can't see shite.
 ![[Doryani On Locus Of Corruption 31 - L19 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: So red... and probably green... wait, how do you know which gems are which?
 ![[Doryani On Locus Of Corruption 31 - L20 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Gems have colours?!
 ![[Doryani On Locus Of Corruption 31 - L21 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Your people truly were impressive.
 ![[Doryani On Locus Of Corruption 31 - L22 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: There's no telling what we could have achieved, had we more time.
 ![[Doryani On Locus Of Corruption 31 - L23 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: The height of progress... the deepest perversion of the natural order.
 ![[Doryani On Locus Of Corruption 31 - L24 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: And what did serving the natural order get you and your kind?
 ![[Doryani On Locus Of Corruption 31 - L25 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: You best watch yourself.
