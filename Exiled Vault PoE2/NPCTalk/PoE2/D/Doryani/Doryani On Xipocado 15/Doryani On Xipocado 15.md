# Doryani On Xipocado 15

Doryani: I argued with Xipocado for years. Pleaded with him, at times. He knew she was dangerous, and that her communion with the Beast might be the death of us.

Doryani: That is Atziri's power over others... she sticks the knife of her beauty into their gut, and twists it for years. But she never gives them the sweet release of acceptance... or rejection. They increasingly bend to her every whim, trying to please her, desperate for acknowledgement or validation. It excuses nothing. In the end, he made his choice.
