# Doryani On The Demon Of Atzoatl 3

Doryani: That is what we called... it's hard to explain. During its construction, our Temple of Atzoatl was plagued by an impossible, elusive, rampaging murderer who appeared at random to assassinate our Architects. Then, when it was completed, they showed up one last time, to slaughter everyone inside and loot everything it contained. The Demon's appearance changed often, but their companion's did not. I now know her to be... Alva Valai. We did determine that the pair were coming from the future, but we could never have guessed how far. It's still unclear when those events are meant to happen... for her. Also... {why?} Why will she go back and aid a rampage through Atzoatl? Actually, maybe that one's obvious.
