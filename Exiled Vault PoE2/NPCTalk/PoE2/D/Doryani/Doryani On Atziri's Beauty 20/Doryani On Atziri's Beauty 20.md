# Doryani On Atziri's Beauty 20

Doryani: Atziri is beautiful, as most women are, in their own ways. Her aura of dominance stems from a very different source... her callousness. Your desires do not matter to her. You could serve her faithfully for decades, and she would still cast you out the moment you displease her. Such behavior builds a society of desperate servile worms. Lies become truth, and cowardice is rewarded. Over time, that kind of environment twists you, warps you. Breaks your spirit.
