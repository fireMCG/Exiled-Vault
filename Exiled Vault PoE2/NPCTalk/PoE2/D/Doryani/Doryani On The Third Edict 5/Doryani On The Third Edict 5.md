Doryani: We have very little information, but if the Seed of Corruption was the instrument of the Second Edict... It may have been created in response to an unknown {First} Edict.

The Hooded One: The first mural I saw was broken... but there was definitely something there. They must have been facing some disaster... or enemy... or change in the world. Did they create the Seed of Corruption in response?

Doryani: Hmm. Whenever the Vaal built something dangerous, we also ran a parallel project... ...as a contingency. The Weapon. The instrument of the Third Edict. I believe it is a failsafe. If the Seed of Corruption grew out of control, then perhaps it was designed to... shut down the experiment.

The Hooded One: Then that is exactly what we will do.
