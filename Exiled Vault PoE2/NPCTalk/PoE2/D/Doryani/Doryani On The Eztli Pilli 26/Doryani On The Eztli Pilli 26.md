# Doryani On The Eztli Pilli 26

Doryani: For a time, the Queen's interests aligned with my own. She sought immortality, and so did I... for different ends.

Warrior: You were complicit.
 ![[Doryani On The Eztli Pilli 26 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: Yes. I make no excuses. I did what I had to do.
 ![[Doryani On The Eztli Pilli 26 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Marauder: [DNT]

Doryani: [DNT]

Huntress: A dangerous pursuit.
 ![[Doryani On The Eztli Pilli 26 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Shadow: [DNT]

Doryani: The most dangerous. My search risked everything.
 ![[Doryani On The Eztli Pilli 26 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: We were not the first to do so, either. The Eztli Pilli was already many centuries old when it passed to me. It contains all the knowledge possibly related to immortality we possess, both from our own civilisation, and... others.

Templar: [DNT]

Doryani: [DNT]

Sorceress: From what I learned, the Vaal grew fat off the riches - and ruins - of others.
 ![[Doryani On The Eztli Pilli 26 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: You built on lost knowledge that led others to ruin.
 ![[Doryani On The Eztli Pilli 26 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: So your learning stemmed from what others grew before you.
 ![[Doryani On The Eztli Pilli 26 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: Yes. The Vaal developed the ability to implant souls into crystals based on ancient necromantic artifacts found deep underground. Our sophisticated golems stemmed from study of the Primevals, who once lived in the same regions we do. Blood thaumaturgy, however... that was us. Our unique contribution to science.

Doryani: Everything we deemed too volatile, dangerous, or useless, we sealed away in the Eztli Pilli, guarded by eighty-seven traps. I should have expected that... {impossible woman...} would walk right up and pluck our deepest secrets without a care in the world.

Mercenary: That's our Miss Valai.
 ![[Doryani On The Eztli Pilli 26 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Duelist: [DNT]

Witch: She does tend to do that.
 ![[Doryani On The Eztli Pilli 26 - L19 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: How do you put up with her?
 ![[Doryani On The Eztli Pilli 26 - L20 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Her optimism is repulsive but... she's not the worst.
 ![[Doryani On The Eztli Pilli 26 - L21 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: From you, that's high praise. Perhaps I'll rethink my annoyance.
 ![[Doryani On The Eztli Pilli 26 - L22 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: She's not going to change just because you wish it.
 ![[Doryani On The Eztli Pilli 26 - L23 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: I would never demean a lady of the Vaal by asking her to diminish herself. It's just...
 ![[Doryani On The Eztli Pilli 26 - L24 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: The {pluckiness.}
 ![[Doryani On The Eztli Pilli 26 - L25 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: Yes. The 'pluckiness.'
