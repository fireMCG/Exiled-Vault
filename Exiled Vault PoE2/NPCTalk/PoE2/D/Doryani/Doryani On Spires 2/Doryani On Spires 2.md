# Doryani On Spires 2

Warrior: We face a dark enemy, below the dirt. They seem to be trying to use Vaal technology... to bring about darkness above ground.

Witch: The Abyssals are trying to use Vaal spires. I guess we shouldn't let that happen...

Sorceress: There were Vaal spires in the darkness. The ancient enemy is plotting something.

Ranger: I saw Vaal structures, deep down. Used by the Abyssals.

Huntress: Under the earth, there were... spires. Like the ones I saw in Utzaal.

Monk: I believe I saw Vaal architecture in use by the Abyssals.

Mercenary: These creatures down there - they're toyin' with some of your Vaal technology. Seems they're trying to plunge the world into darkness or somethin'.

Druid: I encountered dark beings, way down below.
They were using a spire... seekin' to plunge the world into Darkness. Looked like Vaal work.

Doryani: Hmm. It does sound like our technology. Architect Topotante was conducting experiments with the weather. I am uncertain how these devices may have been modified. You should destroy all traces of them. Otherwise, it could mean our doom.
