# Doryani On Studying The Beast 17

Doryani: Direct study of the Beast propelled our technology forward by centuries. Our nobles used gems for generations, but never truly understood what they were.

Warrior: What are they, truly?

Marauder: [DNT]

Witch: Sounds like {you} do, though. Tell me.

Doryani: They come from the Beast's outer flesh, its carapace. They are Corruption, in crystallised form.

Doryani: This new level of understanding swept our greatest minds along with the tide of innovation.

Monk: You learned the truth, and did not reconsider?

Shadow: [DNT]

Duelist: [DNT]

Doryani: There was no thought given to where it would lead.

Templar: [DNT]

Huntress: Perhaps that is why the Spirit has abandoned me. When I used a gem, I took up the power of Corruption as my own.

Druid: That explains why the Maji must never touch them...

Mercenary: You tellin' me gems are chunks of Corruption?

Ranger: Gems are made of Corruption? Why didn't you say anything?
 ![[Doryani On Studying The Beast 17 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Gems are... Corruption? How? They don't drive us mad, or... change us.

Doryani: {You} safely place them in geomantic sockets, a technique I believe the Titans created for humanity during the Third Pact. We Vaal generally implant our gems in our flesh. They are far stronger when used that way, but come with... unwanted consequences. In that respect, the people of your era are far wiser.
