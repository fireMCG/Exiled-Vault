# Lurking Creature On Boundless Cavern 1

Lurking Creature: You come from the Boundless Cavern. No stone in sight above, only fire and void. Hateful beings, spawned by flesh, skitter in the searing light. They seek to rend these ones. To destroy them. This one has never been. This one serves here. This one is frightened.
