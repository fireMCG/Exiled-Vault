Lurking Creature: The Well was not. The Master Below All raged. Then, the Well was, and always had been. The more these ones fought and destroyed, the more souls spiraled into the Well. The nether exalted Kulemak. He rose, and walked the Boundless Cavern above, enduring the searing light and heat without pain. To wage the war, he gifted power to his servants, and they became the Lich Lords. The Lich Lords gifted power to their servants, and they became the Necromancers. These ones have been fighting so long, the Well spirals... the nether overflows... Countless screams blend into one endless exhale that can be heard even in the Boundless Cavern.
