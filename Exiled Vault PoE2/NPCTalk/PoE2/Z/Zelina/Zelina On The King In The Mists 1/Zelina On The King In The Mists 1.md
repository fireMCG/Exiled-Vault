# Zelina On The King In The Mists 1

Zelina: I know little of this entity's origin, only that he is described as emerging from nothing. That's not a metaphor. He comes from a place that is nothing. A void bursting with things that don't exist. Cuachic's ranking system holds me as the most intelligent among us, but even I can't fathom what that actually means.
