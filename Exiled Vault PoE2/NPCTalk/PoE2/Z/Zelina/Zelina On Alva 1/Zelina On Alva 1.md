# Zelina On Alva 1

Zelina: I am intrigued by Alva's existence. We were sent to the vault to act as a failsafe for the Vaal, should they be wiped out. Her bloodline proves that at least some of us survived on the outside... Perhaps, despite all of Master Doryani's efforts, the best plan was simply to have faith... ... and let the spirit of our people win through.
