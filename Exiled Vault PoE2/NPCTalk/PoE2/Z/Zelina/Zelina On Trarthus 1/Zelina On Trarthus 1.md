# Zelina On Trarthus 1

Zelina: Trarthus is now home to a culture of exiles from the Eternal Empire? I've never heard of this 'Eternal Empire.' They sound like upstarts who took advantage of our absence. In our era, Trarthus was inhabited by scattered tribes that originally came from the south. They found the slightly warmer climate to their liking... that, and the geological vapours. They were described as quite intoxicating.
