# Zelina On Surface Cultures 1

Zelina: As I understand it, the Vaal were a shining beacon of power that kept the world safe. They were surrounded by savage cultures that burned, pillaged, and ravaged Wraeclast. Without us, modern life must have been quite terrifying... By wiping that all away, the Cataclysm may have been a blessing in disguise.
