# Zelina On The Trial Of Chaos 1

Zelina: We did not have access to the Trial in the Cuachic Vault. We entreated the favour of Chaos several times over the centuries, but they were not interested. There were very few possibilities in the Vault. All of us were dedicated and disciplined to our cause, so there was no infighting. No... dramatic turns. Boring to watch, I imagine.
