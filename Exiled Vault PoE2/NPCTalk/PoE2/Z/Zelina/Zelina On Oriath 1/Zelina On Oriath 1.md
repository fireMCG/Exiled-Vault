# Zelina On Oriath 1

Zelina: Oriath? Hmm... Ah, a derivative of the original name for the island the Golden Cult called home. They split off from the Azmeri during a difficult time in history. There was a time of famine, fire, and despair... and the gods rose from the ashes. Or so they say. The only god I've ever seen, supposedly, is lying over there doing nothing to aid us.
