# Zelina On The Karui 2

Zelina: A few tomes described the Karui as rabid diseased animals that ate each other and fought for dominance. I don't know if I believe that, though. One account was very different. It was a diary. A noblewoman fell in love with a Karui man from the Rongokurai tribe. She described them as a culture of poetic warriors with intensely strong communal bonds. A biased source, clearly, but a strong note of dissension among the texts.

Zelina: This may be subjective, but you don't look like an animal to me.
