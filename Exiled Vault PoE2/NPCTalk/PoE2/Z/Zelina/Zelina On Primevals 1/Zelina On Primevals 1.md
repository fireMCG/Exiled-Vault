# Zelina On Primevals 1

Zelina: The histories are confusing when it comes to the culture I believe you're asking about. Uzaza, Aul, Putembo... these names are treated more like myths than historical facts. Over the years, I've spent a few of our excess newborns trying to scry for dreams about them. So far, I've seen nothing useful.
