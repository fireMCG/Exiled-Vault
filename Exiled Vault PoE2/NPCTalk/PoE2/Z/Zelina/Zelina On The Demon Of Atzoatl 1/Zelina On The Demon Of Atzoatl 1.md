# Zelina On The Demon Of Atzoatl 1

Zelina: The first generation sealed in the Cuachic Vault passed down stories about you. I never thought you were real... but here you are, with Master Doryani, no less. Truly, this is a time of wonders! We thought you were a curse sent to plague us, but you may be our salvation instead.
