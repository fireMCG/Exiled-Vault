# Zelina On The Maraketh 1

Zelina: The Maraketh were not so bad, according to our tomes. They were militaristic and headstrong. Criminals were tattooed and cast out for a time. The intention was good, but the implementation was wasteful. They should have been using all that blood - and those organs - for more useful ends. In Cuachic, we used everything we possibly could. Nothing discarded.
