# Zarka On Oriath 1

Zarka: I knew you would not let us down. In turn, {we} will not let {you} down. The Maraketh have been roused to war, and it is war we shall bring! If this is the end of times, then we will forge one last great tale to tell before Nekraata! The sum total of life's meaning - and it will be glorious. To Oriath, young one.
