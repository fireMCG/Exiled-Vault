# Zarka On Pools Of Khatal 1

Zarka: Ah, the Pools of Khatal! I was young and spry last time I dared their rejuvenating depths. Long ago, there was a tale-man - yes, that's right, a male tale-woman! It's true! He had a unique gift for shaping water. His {akhara} was beset by creatures of darkness in the early years of the Winter of the World, before the alliance was forged. It was the cold season, and the river had frozen. They built a fortress out of ice, but water was scarce. Ironic, yes? Being surrounded by water, even defended by it, for months... but dying of thirst. Khatal sensed water. He knew not where. He pulled with all his mystic might. He lifted his hands to the sky, beseeching the winds. The winds did not answer. This was long before Garukhan tamed them. Khatal would not give up. He tore at {something}, water {somewhere}... and finally, it emerged. From beneath! It ripped from the ground in great geysers, bringing both water {and} warmth. Not only that, the water collapsed the enemy's tunnels, crushing an entire legion of creatures. His {akhara} was saved... but Khatal turned to dust. He gave his very soul in the effort. Ahh... we honour his sacrifice still, by stopping at his mud pools on the way to the Gifting of Water.
