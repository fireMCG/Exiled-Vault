# Zarka On Consequences 1

Zarka: For most, the {sel khari's} secrecy is kept on pain of death... but for you, there will be no violence. No. If you reveal this secret... I will tell embarrassing stories about you, and pass them down to those that come after me! You {will} be remembered, but not as a hero... as a bumbling fool. A subject of mockery. It is a form of retaliation worse than death, second only to being forgotten. Please do not force me to fulfil this duty.
