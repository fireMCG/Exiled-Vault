# Zarka On Risu's Training 1

Zarka: Risu's training is coming along well. She has a mind for tales. When she is ready to replace me, I am going to go on a journey. I'd like to visit all the places I've been describing my whole life. Ezomyr, Ngamakanui... I hear Trarthus has rather invigorating vapours... Don't act so shocked. I've done my duty. It's time to live a little! Especially if the world is about to end...
