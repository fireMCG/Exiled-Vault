# Zarka On Order Of The Djinn 1

Zarka: Ah, so the Order of the Djinn {has} been rebuilding these last twenty years. I suspected this was the case. The other tale-women talk of movements in the shadows. Tombs found open. Artefacts stolen. When these powerful relics never appeared in the hands of the Faridun, I knew it had to be someone more trustworthy... There are tales we tell, and tales we do {not} tell. The Order has long fought to preserve this world... You would do well to earn their trust, young one.
