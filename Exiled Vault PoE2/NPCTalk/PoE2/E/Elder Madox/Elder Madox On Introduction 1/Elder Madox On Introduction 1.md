# Elder Madox On Introduction 1

Elder Madox: I am Elder Madox. Here... I observe the biting chill of the gale... ... while I mourn our losses. The Winter Owl blesses you, and the Spirit concedes. I have little time left in this world, and I am on my last adventure. From here, I shall observe winter across three weeks of night. Then, I shall join the wisdom of owls who came before me. Before you depart... I bear a gift.

Elder Madox: I am Elder Madox. Your silencing of the Wayward Spear has calmed the Spirit. Here... I observe the biting chill of the gale... ... while I mourn our losses. The Winter Owl blesses you, and the Spirit concedes. I have little time left in this world, and I am on my last adventure. From here, I shall observe winter across three weeks of night. Then, I shall join the wisdom of owls who came before me. Before you depart... I bear a gift.
