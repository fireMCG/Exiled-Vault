# Elder Madox On The Mother Soul 1

Elder Madox: The Mother Soul was hope. The will to carry on, no matter the cost. No matter the sacrifice. No matter the {consequences}... The People of the Mountains cut ties with the Mother Soul long ago. We know not why, only that it happened. The First Children might be the only ones that could recall such things now.
