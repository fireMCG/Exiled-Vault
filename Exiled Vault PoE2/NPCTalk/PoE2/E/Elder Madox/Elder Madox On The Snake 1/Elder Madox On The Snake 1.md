# Elder Madox On The Snake 1

Elder Madox: The Spirit is all things. The Spirit is the world, and it is us... but the Snake stands alone. The Snake whispers. Lies. Manipulates. It has been so since the time of the Mother Soul. And now it speaks as the Spirit, but is not, leading the foolish to ruin.
