# Hilda On Introduction 1

Hilda: Good day to ya. I'm Hilda. Been roaming the world for some time now, hunting all manner of beasts... And as soon as I get my arse back to Mount Kriar... it's all turned to shite! My tribe has fled the region. Someone was roughin' them up. I got one guess who. Lythara, a skilled hunter from a neighbouring tribe, has lost her mind. She and her followers drove my people out, then she turned on her own. I'd sort her out myself, but she packs quite a punch. If you're headin' up the mountain, you'll have to deal with her... ...but there's somethin' else I'd ask of ya.
