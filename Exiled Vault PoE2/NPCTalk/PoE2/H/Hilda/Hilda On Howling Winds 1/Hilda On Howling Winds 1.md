# Hilda On Howling Winds 1

Hilda: There's one beast I've not been able to best. A yeti deep within the caves of Mount Kriar. A truly fearsome bastard! Many claim to have seen him, just not up close... One thing is certain though, you'll hear him! Oh, an unmistakable howl against the icy winds. Seek him out, slay him and bring me his tusks. I'll make it worth yer while!
