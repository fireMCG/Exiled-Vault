# Hilda On The Vaal 1

Hilda: There's {living} Vaal in Mount Kriar? Well, I'll be damned. The stories are true! It's not some children's tale from the Elders, but a yarn we weave on the winter solstice. Many generations ago, a Vaal named Uromoti came to us and wanted to 'buy' a mountain from the Azmeri. You can't {buy} a mountain! It's nonsense! They simply exist! So, we let him pass. Countless Vaal marched up there, trying to capture Mount Kriar. Well they busied themselves, certainly, as eventually, they went silent. We assumed they died up there, trying to 'buy' the mountain from the sky! Perhaps they did make a deal, but with Prospero instead... Ugh, he'd be the type to sell you a mountain.
