# Hilda On The Yeti 1

Hilda: Been huntin' that Yeti in the proper season, these last five years. Oh, he's a shifty one. I follow his howl, but I think he knows. I think he's got... {the sense.} I bet he feels the hair on his neck stand up when I'm on his trail. He'll never feel {you} comin' though. Doesn't know your scent!
