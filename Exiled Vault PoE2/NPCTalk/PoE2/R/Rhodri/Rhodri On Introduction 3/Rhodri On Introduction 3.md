# Rhodri On Introduction 3

Rhodri: That bloody scoundrel, Kanu! I can't believe it! Rhodri's my name. Ship's cook, on this vessel at least.

Warrior: Ah, so you make the food we've been... eating.
 ![[Rhodri On Introduction 3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: I thought I was the one turning the crew green. Turns out, it was just your food.

Sorceress: Your food is much maligned by the crew.

Ranger: You make the food we've been... eating? Ah. Right.

Huntress: Is the food supposed to be like that, then?

Monk: Your meals have put me through quite the spiritual journey.

Mercenary: Your gruel is aptly named, mate. Grueling.

Druid: So you're to blame for the grub? Had me thinkin' I'd eaten the wrong berries again.

Rhodri: Don't hold it against me, I don't usually cook, okay? I just signed on to round out the crew. Technically, I'm the highest ranking Trade Guild member on this ship, so I guess... ... I'm the Captain now! I'll get you where you need to go in Makoru's absence. Our first order of business ought to be getting her back! Set a course, and I'll make it happen.
