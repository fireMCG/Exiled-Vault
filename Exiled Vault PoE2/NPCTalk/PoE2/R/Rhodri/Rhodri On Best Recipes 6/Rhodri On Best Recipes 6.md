# Rhodri On Best Recipes 6

Rhodri: My best recipes? Hmmm. That's a good question. Generally speaking, I cook what I've got. I can't cook what I haven't got now, can I?

Warrior: Water and cabbage keeps a man alive. Mostly.
 ![[Rhodri On Best Recipes 6 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: So that's why it's hot cabbage water every night.
 ![[Rhodri On Best Recipes 6 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I suppose I prefer water and cabbage over fish. They're unnatural.
 ![[Rhodri On Best Recipes 6 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: I've never eaten this poorly in my life, and I grew up in the woods... So, what {do} you have?

Huntress: It's water and leaves again tonight, is it?
 ![[Rhodri On Best Recipes 6 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: That is technically true. And what {have} you to cook?
 ![[Rhodri On Best Recipes 6 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: What've you got, then? Don't say water and cabbage...
 ![[Rhodri On Best Recipes 6 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: Oh so that's why it's naught but cabbage soup around here.
 ![[Rhodri On Best Recipes 6 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Rhodri: Trusty cabbage soup! A staple aboard the Aurora May. A tradition, really.
 ![[Rhodri On Best Recipes 6 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: Ugh. We should pick up better supplies.
 ![[Rhodri On Best Recipes 6 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: I've never been a fan of tradition. And now, even less.
 ![[Rhodri On Best Recipes 6 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Some traditions are mistakes.
 ![[Rhodri On Best Recipes 6 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Yes... a tradition...
 ![[Rhodri On Best Recipes 6 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: I have no choice but to respect your ways... I 'spose.
 ![[Rhodri On Best Recipes 6 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Who am I to argue with tradition?
 ![[Rhodri On Best Recipes 6 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: He said it. Bugger me.
 ![[Rhodri On Best Recipes 6 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: Food's food, I suppose. But I've chewed bark with more flavour.
 ![[Rhodri On Best Recipes 6 - L18 - A1.ogg]]

Rhodri: Well, look...
 ![[Rhodri On Best Recipes 6 - L19 - A1.ogg]]

Rhodri: What's that supposed to mean then?
 ![[Rhodri On Best Recipes 6 - L20 - A1.ogg]]

Rhodri: Look, it ain't my fault!
 ![[Rhodri On Best Recipes 6 - L21 - A1.ogg]]

Rhodri: Well there's plenty of trees around if you're gonna be precious about it!
 ![[Rhodri On Best Recipes 6 - L22 - A1.ogg]]

Rhodri: If you want fancy, go to the Kingsmarch tavern. We're here to do a job.
