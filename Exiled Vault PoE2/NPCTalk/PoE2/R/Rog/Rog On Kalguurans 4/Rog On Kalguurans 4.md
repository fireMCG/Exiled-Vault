Rog, the Dealer: Well, most Kalguurans here on Wraeclast are in various guilds. I'm in the Meridian Free Traders, the trade guild that owns the charter for Kingsmarch. You can't beat our logistics! Dannig is in the Artificers' Guild these days. Tujen's a freelance harbourmaster, but he stays close. You gotta keep the family together, you know? The wife's the only one still carrying on our grand quest... I sure do miss her... but she always comes back soon enough. On an unrelated note... the King's Hand is due to return to Kalguur any day now... take care if you see {him} around.
