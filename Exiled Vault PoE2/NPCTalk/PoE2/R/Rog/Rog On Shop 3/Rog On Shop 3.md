# Rog On Shop 3

Rog, the Dealer: This shop is my pride and joy. I've been dreaming of running my own place since my younger days, even though that was impossible back home.

Ranger: What brought you here?

Huntress: I'd never have left me home of my own choosin', no matter what I had to endure.

Monk: You followed a dream. I can respect that. What was your hardship?

Witch: What drove you away, fat one?

Sorceress: This sounds like a beautiful dream. Tell me more of this, Sir Rog.

Warrior: Home is wherever your family is. What made you leave Kalguur?

Mercenary: Ah, the quest for wealth. What was the issue in Kalguur?

Rog, the Dealer: There are a limited number of merchant licenses, all owned by wealthy families. New licenses only come up every few years, but I could never afford one back in Kalguur. I've fallen on better times here in Wraeclast, you might say! So, here I am. I was never one for grand quests. Always preferred sorting logistics from the back... but I'm glad I'm here. I'd never have had my children, or built all this. The wife says I'm the real hero, because I have a business and support my family. She might just be buttering me up, but I still take it to heart.
