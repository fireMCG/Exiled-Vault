# Rog On Olroth 4

Rog, the Dealer: You finally found and defeated Olroth! A battle for the ages, no doubt!
 ![[Rog On Olroth 4 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: That's not important. The Flame was destroyed.
 ![[Rog On Olroth 4 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: It would have been, if the Flame hadn't been destroyed.
 ![[Rog On Olroth 4 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: It's not about that. I couldn't save the Flame.
 ![[Rog On Olroth 4 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Of course. Shame about the Flame, though.
 ![[Rog On Olroth 4 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I wish you could have seen it, Sir Rog. Perhaps then you could have salvaged the Flame.
 ![[Rog On Olroth 4 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: It was. The Flame, unfortunately, was destroyed.
 ![[Rog On Olroth 4 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Right you are! Could't get the Flame, though...
 ![[Rog On Olroth 4 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: Indeed it was. But I couldnae save the Flame.
 ![[Rog On Olroth 4 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Rog, the Dealer: {Olroth} had the Flame? Then Uhtred was not a traitor! I can finally set history right! I am descended from Owen, the son that Uhtred sent back for safety. You've washed clean a black mark on my lineage. I thank you. Still... a shame about the Flame being destroyed, of course.

 ![[Rog On Olroth 4 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

 ![[Rog On Olroth 4 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

 ![[Rog On Olroth 4 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: So. It's personal.
 ![[Rog On Olroth 4 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

 ![[Rog On Olroth 4 - L17 - A1.ogg]]
