# Rog On Long Story 3

Rog, the Dealer: Alright then - if you insist, I'll tell the tale! Two decades ago, our glorious leader, Dannig, led us on an expedition across stormy and dangerous oceans to look for an artefact called the Triskelion Flame. Our search took us to the forsaken continent of Wraeclast, a land filled with horrible monsters and raving mad exiles!

Sorceress: Outside the Vastiri, maybe. You should visit our desert sometime. It is quite beautiful.

Mercenary: Ain't that the truth.

Druid: Aye... sadly, that much is true...

Rog, the Dealer: But we excavated many ancient sites, uncovering some of the lost history of our people's short residence here. Long ago, Kalguurans tried to settle on Wraeclast, and uh... well, yeah... it did not go well. In the end, they did not survive, and they lost the Triskelion Flame. We've been looking for it for over twenty years now, and, to be honest, we've gotten a bit sidetracked, but my wife refuses to give up on the dream.
