# Rog On Order Of The Chalice 7

Rog, the Dealer: I am bound by honour to discover the fate of Uhtred and the Order of the Chalice on Wraeclast. I'll trade you for any relics that you find with their marks and runes.

Druid: I've not heard o' this 'Order of the Chalice'.

Rog, the Dealer: They were the primary priesthood and religious order that went in with the initial ships to Wraeclast.
 ![[Rog On Order Of The Chalice 7 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: A religious order? I thought the Kalguurans... hmm. What kind of priests?
 ![[Rog On Order Of The Chalice 7 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: What is a 'priest?'
 ![[Rog On Order Of The Chalice 7 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Ah, so heretics. Strange. I haven't heard you mention faith. Who were these priests?
 ![[Rog On Order Of The Chalice 7 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: I thought you odd bunch didn't have a religion. What kind of priests were they?
 ![[Rog On Order Of The Chalice 7 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I did not know Kalguurans were religious types. What kind of priests were they?
 ![[Rog On Order Of The Chalice 7 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: They were priests?
 ![[Rog On Order Of The Chalice 7 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Ahh. So, a cult. Got it. What were they like?
 ![[Rog On Order Of The Chalice 7 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: Priests, eh? Didnae think you Kalguurans were fond o' religion.
 ![[Rog On Order Of The Chalice 7 - L18 - A1.ogg]]

Rog, the Dealer: Not quite the type you have out here. They interpreted the stars and the workings of mysterious forces, such as alchemy and runes.
 ![[Rog On Order Of The Chalice 7 - L19 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: You're right, that's not like priests here...
 ![[Rog On Order Of The Chalice 7 - L20 - A1.ogg]]

 ![[Rog On Order Of The Chalice 7 - L21 - A1.ogg]]

 ![[Rog On Order Of The Chalice 7 - L22 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: But those are {real} things. Sciences.
 ![[Rog On Order Of The Chalice 7 - L23 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Oh, they were tale-women! We are not so different after all.
 ![[Rog On Order Of The Chalice 7 - L24 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: That sounds more like smiths and engineers.
 ![[Rog On Order Of The Chalice 7 - L25 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Ey? That's not a religion... huh.
 ![[Rog On Order Of The Chalice 7 - L26 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: No denyin', there's wisdom to be found in the stars.
 ![[Rog On Order Of The Chalice 7 - L27 - A1.ogg]]

Rog, the Dealer: I've always wanted to join the Order. I quite like the idea of spending my days in a laboratory doing research.
