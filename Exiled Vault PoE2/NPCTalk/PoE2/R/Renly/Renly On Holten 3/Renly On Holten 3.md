# Renly On Holten 3

Renly: The Thanedom of Holten is closest to us by land. Their Thanes have long been our Count's right-hand men. We don't even consider ourselves separate. We intermarry all the time, and share in the harvest. It was bad enough when Thane Wulfric refused to help us, due to the Count's madness. Stealing people away when we're vulnerable... it is unthinkable...

Renly: You know it well. The Thanedom of Holten is closest to us by land, and their Thanes have long been our Count's right-hand men. It was bad enough when Thane Wulfric refused to help us, due to the Count's madness. Stealing people away when we're vulnerable... it's unthinkable...
