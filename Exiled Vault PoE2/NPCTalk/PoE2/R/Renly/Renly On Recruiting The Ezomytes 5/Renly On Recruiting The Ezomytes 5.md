Warrior: Father... we need the strength of the Ezomytes. Wraeclast is in peril.

Witch: I came here to recruit you, not the other way around.
 ![[Renly On Recruiting The Ezomytes 5 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: That is unfortunate. We have great need of you, and your fellow Ezomytes.
 ![[Renly On Recruiting The Ezomytes 5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: It's good to be home, but I, too, have grave news. Wraeclast may fall to Corruption, and we need you to fight.
 ![[Renly On Recruiting The Ezomytes 5 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Aye, Renly. Seems our survival will be tested to the end of our days. The Ezomytes are needed for a coming battle.

Monk: Unfortunately, we need the Ezomytes to stave off a coming doom.

Renly: By the First Ones... you're calling us to war? Our people do owe you a debt... but right now, Ogham is on the brink of destruction once more. We can't sleep. We can't move. We can't rebuild... We're being picked off in the dead of night! One by one, our people are being dragged off into the darkness. Only the distant sound of screams gives us a clue as to what has happened.

Renly: By the First Ones... you're calling us to war? My boy... you know my people are your people, and we stand with you. But, right now, Ogham is on the brink of destruction once more. We can't sleep. We can't move. We can't rebuild... We're being picked off in the dead of night! One by one, our people are being dragged off into the darkness. Only the distant sound of screams gives us a clue as to what has happened.

Warrior: What's doing this, Father?
 ![[Renly On Recruiting The Ezomytes 5 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: And I suppose you want me to deal with this, too.
 ![[Renly On Recruiting The Ezomytes 5 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: This sounds serious.
 ![[Renly On Recruiting The Ezomytes 5 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: It never ends.
 ![[Renly On Recruiting The Ezomytes 5 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: That's no bloody good.
 ![[Renly On Recruiting The Ezomytes 5 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Do you have any idea {why} this is happening?
 ![[Renly On Recruiting The Ezomytes 5 - L18 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Kidnapping, but no ransom?
 ![[Renly On Recruiting The Ezomytes 5 - L19 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: Who's responsible for all this?
 ![[Renly On Recruiting The Ezomytes 5 - L20 - A1.ogg]]

Renly: Our neighbours... in Holten. Thane Wulfric and Lady Elswyth have lost their bloody minds. Bloodletting. Torture. Pain, misery, and death! That's all that lies in wait for those stolen off to Holten. Look, now I understand you need us, but we can't leave this place undefended in the face of this. Help us once more, and we'll come to your aid.
