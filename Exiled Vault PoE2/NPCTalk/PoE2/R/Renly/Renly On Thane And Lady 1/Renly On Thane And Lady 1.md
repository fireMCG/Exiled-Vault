# Renly On Thane And Lady 1

Renly: Well, we thought that Thane Wulfric and Lady Elswyth might have been driven mad by Corruption... ... but Holten, and the Blackwood, oh... are suffering from a far different malady. Cultists walk their streets, darkness clouds their land, and whispers hound any who travel there. Finn told us how it reminds him of Freythorn. The bloodletting... the rituals... oh... it's horrible to think an entire Thanedom has fallen.
