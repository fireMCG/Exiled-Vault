Renly: Good. We've still not rebuilt the roads the Count destroyed, so you'll have to take a harrowing route. Of late, we call it the Blackwood, for it has become home to darkness and madness. You'll find a path to reach it through the crops. Una knows more about the Blackwood's curse... I dare not go there. Should you need to, call on her.
