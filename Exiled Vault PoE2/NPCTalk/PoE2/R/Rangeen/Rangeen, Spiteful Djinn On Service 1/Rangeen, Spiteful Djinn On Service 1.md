# Rangeen, Spiteful Djinn On Service 1

Rangeen, Spiteful Djinn: What do you care? You're not going to free me. Fine. I fled. Kulemak personally assaulted our caravan, and I ran for my life. Everyone else died... and rose again, to serve the Abyssals. We should all have run. It was foolish to fight. I am no coward, and I'll never submit.
