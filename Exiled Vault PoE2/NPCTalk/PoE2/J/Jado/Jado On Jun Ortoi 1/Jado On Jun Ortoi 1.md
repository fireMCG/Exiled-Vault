# Jado On Jun Ortoi 1

Jado: We have been watching you since you helped slay Jamanra. Sometimes, a catalyst appears - an exceptional individual in a time of great need. The Godslayer was one such catalyst. Perhaps you are, as well. We can certainly hope. I will not speak for Jun. She will introduce herself... when the time is right.
