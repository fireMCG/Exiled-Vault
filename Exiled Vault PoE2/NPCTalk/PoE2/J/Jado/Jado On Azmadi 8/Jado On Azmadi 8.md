# Jado On Azmadi 8

Jado: If Azmadi {has} been empowered by Zarokh, they must have met. And to have met, Azmadi must have completed the ancient Trial of the {Sekhemas}.

Sekhema Asala: Nonsense! The mere notion is absurd!

Jado: Is it? In your heart of hearts, do you believe it impossible that a Faridun survived the test? Perhaps he made it to Zarokh... then, facing his doom, cut a deal.

Sekhema Asala: I... suppose such a thing is possible. In recent days, I {have} met many capable Faridun who are worthy to join us.

Jado: Indeed. If he did complete the Trial... he may be attempting to supplant you and make a bid for {Sekhema} of {Sekhemas}.

Sekhema Asala: The {akharas} would never follow him.

Jado: Are you absolutely certain of that?

Sekhema Asala: Hmm... these {are} strange times...
