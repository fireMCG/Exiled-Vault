# Jado On Chronomancy 5

Jado: Azmadi possessed powers I have only seen the most gifted tale-women wield. I believe they call it 'chronomancy.' He channeled Time itself, as if it was an element to bend to his will. This power was not his own. He called out to 'Zarokh' to aid him.

Sekhema Asala: Zarokh? The ancient Djinn locked in the depths of the original Trial of the {Sekhemas}?

Jado: I believe so. This may be part of a plan... perhaps... The First {Barya}! It is the only one left powerful enough to carry Zarokh's essence!

Sekhema Asala: He's trying to escape his punishment.

Jado: That might be the case... If there is indeed a plan at work, we must be careful not to play into the schemer's hands.
