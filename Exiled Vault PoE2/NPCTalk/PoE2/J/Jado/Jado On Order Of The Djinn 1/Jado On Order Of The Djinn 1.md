# Jado On Order Of The Djinn 1

Jado: We are a small but dedicated group. Orphans, only. One from each culture on Wraeclast. Our leader, Jun Ortoi, has been rebuilding the Order for the last twenty years in secret. I do not know what happened two decades ago... she refuses to talk about it. All we can do is look forward. The time has come for us to fight to save this world, and we shall succeed - or die trying.
