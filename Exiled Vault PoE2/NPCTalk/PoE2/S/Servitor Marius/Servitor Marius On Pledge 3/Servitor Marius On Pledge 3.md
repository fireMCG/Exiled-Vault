# Servitor Marius On Pledge 3

Servitor Marius: Yes! The pledge is something we take very seriously. It is a commitment. A commitment to yourself, and to Utopia. All we ask is that you join us wholeheartedly, without fear. Doubt is natural, and we will answer all your questions. Leaving only pure determination toward the betterment of the world!

Servitor Marius: You need not decide immediately, of course. Dine with us. Come to know us. We always say: you arrive a stranger on Arastas, but remain as a friend. The pledge can come later. For now, how about tithing?
