# Servitor Marius On Culture 4

Servitor Marius: You bear an odd mix of tattoos. A few Karui, most Ezomyte, one or two Oriathan slave marks. What is your tale, I wonder?

Warrior: I wish I knew. I was found on the shores of Ogham by my father.

Servitor Marius: Ahh... there were many shipwrecks and tragedies when Oriath fell. It's possible your ancestry is lost to time. Supposedly, the Karui can speak to their ancestors. Perhaps you should ask them.

Warrior: I might just do that... if they'll listen.
