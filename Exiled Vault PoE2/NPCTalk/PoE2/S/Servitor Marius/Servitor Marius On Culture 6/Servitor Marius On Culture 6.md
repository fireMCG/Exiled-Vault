Servitor Marius: Whether you appreciate it or not, we're building Utopia for you, too. We will lift your pain, and absolve that which drives you to dark magics.

Witch: I like my pain, thank you. It's what drives me ever forward, a relentless whip at my heels.

Servitor Marius: I see. You have no home, no friends, not even a pet - not a living one, anyway. You fear you would be nothing, if not for your ambition.

Witch: Shut your mouth, old man, before I rip it out.
