# Sekhema Asala On The Envoy 6

Sekhema Asala: Did our scouts find you?

Sekhema Asala: It is good to see you.
 ![[Sekhema Asala On The Envoy 6 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: No, I returned to seek your aid. We must assault Oriath, to slay the Beast.
 ![[Sekhema Asala On The Envoy 6 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Scouts? No. The Beast is in Oriath, and it's time we did something about it.
 ![[Sekhema Asala On The Envoy 6 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Likewise. I have discovered that the Beast is in Oriath, and we must wage war.
 ![[Sekhema Asala On The Envoy 6 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: You had scouts looking for me? The Beast is in Oriath. We must go.
 ![[Sekhema Asala On The Envoy 6 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: I am not so easily found. We must get to Oriath. The Beast is there.
 ![[Sekhema Asala On The Envoy 6 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Not possible. I've been on the sea. The Beast has been taken to Oriath.
 ![[Sekhema Asala On The Envoy 6 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Might have. Not sure. I've come to ask your aid once again, boss. The Beast... it's in Oriath.
 ![[Sekhema Asala On The Envoy 6 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: Aye, I've returned. But not for pleasantries. The Beast's in Oriath, and we need yer help to take it down.
 ![[Sekhema Asala On The Envoy 6 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Sekhema Asala: Yes. We have learned this as well, and have been looking for you. Your return is timely. I am making moves to gather the {akharas} for war, but they will not follow my leadership unless this goes well. This year, because of what I am attempting to do, it has become my duty to oversee the Gifting of Water. In the city of Qimah, the {akharas} gather at the appointed time, as marked by the skies. There, we divide sacred water. We 'keep the river flowing,' as it is said. The same waters that once flowed through Keth.

Warrior: A powerful tradition. How can I help?
 ![[Sekhema Asala On The Envoy 6 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Hmm. And something's not going according to plan, I take it?
 ![[Sekhema Asala On The Envoy 6 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I am familiar. Is there a problem?
 ![[Sekhema Asala On The Envoy 6 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Am I to play some role in this?
 ![[Sekhema Asala On The Envoy 6 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: I can respect that. You sound concerned, though.
 ![[Sekhema Asala On The Envoy 6 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: A symbol of unity. What can I do?
 ![[Sekhema Asala On The Envoy 6 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: That's all above my head. What's my job?
 ![[Sekhema Asala On The Envoy 6 - L18 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: Goin' by yer tone, I'd venture somethin's gone sideways.
 ![[Sekhema Asala On The Envoy 6 - L19 - A1.ogg]]

Sekhema Asala: The {sel khari}, the sacred guardians of the First {Barya}, have not arrived... Three nights before the Gifting, they are to bring the {Barya} here. We cannot find them, nor have we received word. It is not mere chance that this has happened at such a time... there is an enemy at work. I am not permitted to know where the {sel khari} live. Zarka, can you entrust this knowledge to an outsider?

Zarka: Yes, in times of need. This surely qualifies. You earned our trust by your care and service at Deshar. Come closer, young one. I must speak to you privately.
