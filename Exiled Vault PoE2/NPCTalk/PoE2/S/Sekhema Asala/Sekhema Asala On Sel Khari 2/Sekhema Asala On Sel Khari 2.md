Sekhema Asala: Did you abandon your tale-woman duties before they taught you this?

Sekhema Asala: Long ago, when the bounty of the land began to shift against us, we enacted traditions that would safeguard the future. Each {akhara} sends one {dekhara} per generation to the {sel khari}. Thus, they are loyal to all, and to none. They watch over vast underground reserves that were built in Keth's fading days. For countless generations, the Gifting of Water meant pouring water {into} the reserves. Now, in this era of thirst and heat, we are given what our forebears set aside for us. When I drink, it is from water given to me by my mother, and her mother before her. Their sacrifice. Their resolve. The Grand Water Djinn, Rashi, is crucial to maintaining these reserves... which is why the {sel khari's} absence is so concerning.
