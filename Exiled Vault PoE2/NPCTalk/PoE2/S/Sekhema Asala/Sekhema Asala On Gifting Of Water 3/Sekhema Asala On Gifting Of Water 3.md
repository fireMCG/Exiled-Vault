Sekhema Asala: The Gifting of Water is an opportunity to air grievances and heal old wounds. It takes place at the last reservoir of the original Seven Waters. The last true remnant of Keth's glory days. If I am to enlist the other {akharas} in this war, I must do so at this ritual. The fact that they have chosen me to do this means they are at least open to moving forward.
