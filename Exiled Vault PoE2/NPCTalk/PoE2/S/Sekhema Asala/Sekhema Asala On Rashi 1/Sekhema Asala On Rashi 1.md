# Sekhema Asala On Rashi 1

Sekhema Asala: To keep the reserves from running dry, Rashi collects water from the winds throughout the seasons. She inhabits the First {Barya}. The {sel khari} bring her to us. We take her to the sacred site, and Rashi bleeds what she gathered. In this way, we replenish our reserves. Rashi is not a criminal, like so many others bound to {baryas.} She chose this duty. She could choose to move on at any time; to pass the burden to another. She has not yet done so. It is a grim and solemn duty. Each time she is bled of water... her screams are haunting. This existence, alone in all that I have seen in this world, I do not believe I could endure. She has my utmost respect.
