Jado: I am Jado... Now, stay your blade! I am not your enemy!
 ![[Sekhema Asala On The First Barya 13 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Sekhema Asala: As {Sekhema} of the Ardura, I demand you explain yourself!

Jado: Very well... we learned that someone was planning an attack on the Gifting of Water. I infiltrated the {sel khari} to protect the First {Barya}.

Sekhema Asala: Who is this 'we'?

Jado: The... Order of the Djinn.

Sekhema Asala: So... Zarka's suspicions are true. You {have} started to replenish your ranks. Who attacked you?

Jado: A rogue sect of Faridun who stand against you. Their leader calls himself 'Prince Azmadi.'

Sekhema Asala: More false titles! How did you let a pack of stray dogs best you?

Jado: They had help... from the Serpent Clan.
 ![[Sekhema Asala On The First Barya 13 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Sekhema Asala: Of course! They swore vengeance for the death of their Queen at Keth.

Jado: Even then, I should have been able to hold them off. But Azmadi... he had strange abilities... powers beyond his own... He invoked the name Zarokh... They've taken the First {Barya}, and they left in the direction of Qimah.

Sekhema Asala: Then we must give chase! Come, let us return to my {akhara}.
