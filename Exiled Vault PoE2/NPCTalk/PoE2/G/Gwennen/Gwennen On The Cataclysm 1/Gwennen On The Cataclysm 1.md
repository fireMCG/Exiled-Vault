# Gwennen On The Cataclysm 1

Gwennen: Yet another Cataclysm on Wraeclast. What happened this time? You didn't reach Oriath soon enough? Hmm... when exactly did it happen? The ship had just gotten to the harbour... alright... Tell me everything. I'll memorise every detail. For... posterity. And I'll have Alva write it down.
