# Finn On Freythorn 3

Finn: Not everything's beans and cheese, even under Renly. I pushed to have the clanless... well, what's left of 'em... fill the ranks. To... join the clans. But that's not up to him. He can't change how people are.

Una: These trying times have brought out the best in us... but also the worst.

Finn: I'm gonna rebuild Freythorn, I am! Even though {I'm} not clanless anymore, I need to do it. I'll build that palace in the trees, the one I told you about. With {two} stocked kitchens. Just uh... well, it won't be for me anymore... It'll be for them.
