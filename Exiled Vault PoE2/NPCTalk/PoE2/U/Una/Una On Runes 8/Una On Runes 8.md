# Una On Runes 8

Una: We keep our history in the form of songs. I don't exactly know how runes were first brought to us. All we know is that 'newcomers' arrived and gave us knowledge in exchange for food and shelter. One song says: {'There came a great storm, crashing across the sky...'} {'There came a great need, or the sodden would die.'} A children's tale speaks of fey folk who became human. A tribe that appeared out of a 'ring' of runes in the forest.

Finn: Hmm... I guess I never really thought about all the runed stones lying all over Phaaryl before. They just {were}. Always have been there.

Una: Someone must know. The newcomers never moved on. Their names are part of our clan histories now.

Finn: Wait, so... they... you know... with our ancestors?

Una: Yes.

Finn: Well that means I might never have been clanless! Maybe I'm from some long lost clan of heroic types from faraway!

Una: Yes, darling. You might very well be a hero's descendant.
