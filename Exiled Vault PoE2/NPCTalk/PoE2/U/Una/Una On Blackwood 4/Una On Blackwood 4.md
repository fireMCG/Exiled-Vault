# Una On Blackwood 4

Una: We call it the Blackwood now because it is overrun by darkness. It was once a beautiful forest known to us as the Beltimber, but now, we dare not go there. The sun never reaches the forest floor, and cultists have made it their home.

Finn: It's the same sort of darkness we saw in Freythorn. The whispering, creeping, lurking shite, that killed all my friends.
