# Una On The Henge 7

Una: The henge at the centre of the Stones of Serle was one of the first sites the Ezomytes built when the newcomers taught us runes so very long ago.

Finn: Yeah, those stones are creepy. There's an odd power there. An old power. Makes your hair stand on end, some days.

Una: I knew it would still hold power! As the song goes, {'the darker the night, the brighter the runelight...'}

Finn: Yeah, it's true, too. Some nights, way back when, I'd huddle by a runed stone all night... ...just so the wolves wouldn't get me.

Una: Not to worry, it's okay. You've got a home now.

Finn: Don't think I'm not happy with it. I just dream big!

Una: {Two} kitchens, {four} bedrooms... yes, I know.
