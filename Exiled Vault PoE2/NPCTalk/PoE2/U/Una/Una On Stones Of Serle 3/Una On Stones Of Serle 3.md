# Una On Stones Of Serle 3

Una: There is a henge at the centre of the Stones of Serle. We could try to summon the fey spirits there.

Finn: Them old stones, eh? There's a strange power there. An old power. Makes your hair stand on end, some days.

Una: It was one of the first sites the Ezomytes built when newcomers taught us runes so very long ago. That's why I hold out hope that we can still be heard. As the song goes, {'the darker the night, the brighter the runelight...'} If I can reach the fey spirits, they will help you push through the darkness of the Blackwood. They can show you the way.
