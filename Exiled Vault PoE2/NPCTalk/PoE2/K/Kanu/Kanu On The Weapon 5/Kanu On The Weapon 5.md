Witch: Yes, the ancient Weapon spread in pieces across the sea for thousands of years just {snaps together.}

Huntress: Got no idea. Your guess is as good as mine. But it probably won't be {that} easy.

Monk: It's just another step in the puzzle of history. But this... is no easy puzzle.

Mercenary: I'll suggest they try that. Chances are it's a bit more complicated. Always is.

Witch: You ask too many questions.

Kanu: Hmm. Yeah, guess you're right. Nothing's that easy, is it? Let me ask around, eh? Maybe somebody's heard a rumour, or a myth. You never know.
