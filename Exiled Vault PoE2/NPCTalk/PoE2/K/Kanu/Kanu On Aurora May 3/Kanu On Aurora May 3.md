# Kanu On Aurora May 3

Kanu: The Karui have no ships like the Aurora May. Our vessels are meant to travel between islands or to fish. But the Aurora May... phwoar... She feels like she could take us to the end of the world.

Kanu: I'm just happy to live in times like these. I think about it sometimes, you know. What a day to be alive, to breathe in the air, feel the sun. Could be a lot worse.
