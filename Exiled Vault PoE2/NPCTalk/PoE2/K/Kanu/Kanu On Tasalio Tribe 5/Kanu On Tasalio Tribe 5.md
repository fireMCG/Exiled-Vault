# Kanu On Tasalio Tribe 5

Kanu: My family wasn't always from these parts, you know. We came out here a few generations ago. I was always out exploring the waters and fishing, even as a young boy. That's just in my blood. My family's tribe... the Tasalio tribe... they value being on the water above all, but the young ones were never allowed to go very far. I used to drive my parents nuts. I looked out across the water... and oh boy, I wanted to keep going. But I never went too far. I couldn't leave my family behind. Where {they} are... {that's} my home.

Druid: And if you've no family? What then?

Mercenary: I said {won't} get stabbed.
