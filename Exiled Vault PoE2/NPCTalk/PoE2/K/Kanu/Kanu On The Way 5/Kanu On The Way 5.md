# Kanu On The Way 5

Kanu: When the Kalguurans showed up, it brought a lot of tension to the tribes. Also brought doubt among the outer islands. My family left the Tasalio tribe when I was only a boy. They then joined the Tukohama tribe. My parents found hope in their message of strength.

Warrior: Did {you}?
 ![[Kanu On The Way 5 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: You sound skeptical.
 ![[Kanu On The Way 5 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: As they should. Did you feel the same?

Ranger: I suppose when you have children, you can't afford to go it alone.
 ![[Kanu On The Way 5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: And I 'spose... you didn't?
 ![[Kanu On The Way 5 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: I can understand that. But did you find hope in that message?
 ![[Kanu On The Way 5 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Gotta give it to 'im, he's consistent.
 ![[Kanu On The Way 5 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: Strength alone's a poor compass.
 ![[Kanu On The Way 5 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Kanu: Well, look... I don't reject the Way. It just feels different to me. Late at night, out on the sea... I can still feel what our old tribe called 'the Flow.' It's real. It's powerful.

Warrior: The Flow? Is that similar to the Way?
 ![[Kanu On The Way 5 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: I've always felt a flow of energy underneath the world. Is it... like that?
 ![[Kanu On The Way 5 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: The sea has a power?
 ![[Kanu On The Way 5 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: And what makes your 'Flow' different from the Way?
 ![[Kanu On The Way 5 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: What is it, this 'Flow'?
 ![[Kanu On The Way 5 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Tell me more of this 'Flow.'
 ![[Kanu On The Way 5 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Whatchu mean?
 ![[Kanu On The Way 5 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: What {is} it, exactly?
 ![[Kanu On The Way 5 - L18 - A1.ogg]]

Kanu: Oh... it's hard to put into words... All I know is, Tavakai's version of 'The Way' is definitely not something I can flow with. Tavakai doesn't trust outsiders. He wants to drive the Karui further away into isolation. And that doesn't feel right to me. Feels backwards. We should at least hear new ideas out. See what they can offer us.
