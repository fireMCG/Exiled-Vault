# Kanu On The Weapon 8

: So... found more of that fancy Weapon, eh? Can I see it?
 ![[Kanu On The Weapon 8 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: We cannot touch it. The Hooded One keeps the pieces safe.
 ![[Kanu On The Weapon 8 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: No. You cannot.
 ![[Kanu On The Weapon 8 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: The Hooded One has it concealed... I dare not ask where. It cannot be safely touched by mortal hands.
 ![[Kanu On The Weapon 8 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: I don't think so.
 ![[Kanu On The Weapon 8 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Would show ya if I could. But they're full of {rathin}.
 ![[Kanu On The Weapon 8 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: That would not be a good idea.
 ![[Kanu On The Weapon 8 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Yeah, why not? I'll bring it around at some point. I just don't have it on me.
 ![[Kanu On The Weapon 8 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: Unless you want to lose yer mind to Corruption... it's best you don't.
 ![[Kanu On The Weapon 8 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Kanu: Oh... okay. Well, the more I hear, the more curious I get. Can't really blame me, I'm a simple fella. Something like this... entire generations come and go without having eyes on a thing so significant!

Warrior: So {now} you take it seriously?
 ![[Kanu On The Weapon 8 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: So now you are interested in its power. Curious.
 ![[Kanu On The Weapon 8 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: It is something to be taken seriously. Whether it works, remains to be seen.
 ![[Kanu On The Weapon 8 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Why take it so seriously all of a sudden?
 ![[Kanu On The Weapon 8 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: So... you're taking note of it now. Fair enough.
 ![[Kanu On The Weapon 8 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: I see that you take it more seriously now.
 ![[Kanu On The Weapon 8 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Oh look, someone's taking it all a bit more serious!
 ![[Kanu On The Weapon 8 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: It's just as well they do. This Weapon is no mere trinket.
 ![[Kanu On The Weapon 8 - L18 - A1.ogg]]

Kanu: No kidding.
 ![[Kanu On The Weapon 8 - L19 - A1.ogg]]

Kanu: The crew talks. I listen. Some of them heard that Doryabi guy arguing with the spooky one in the cape. It did sound all very serious.
 ![[Kanu On The Weapon 8 - L20 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: That'd be Doryani and the Hooded One.
 ![[Kanu On The Weapon 8 - L21 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Doryani. And the Hooded One. Fool.
 ![[Kanu On The Weapon 8 - L22 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: You mean Doryani and the Hooded One.
 ![[Kanu On The Weapon 8 - L23 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: I think you mean Doryani and the Hooded One.
 ![[Kanu On The Weapon 8 - L24 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Oh, Doryani and... the Hooded One?
 ![[Kanu On The Weapon 8 - L25 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Their titles are Doryani and... the Hooded One.
 ![[Kanu On The Weapon 8 - L26 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: You mean Doryani and... oh well, whatever. Close enough.
 ![[Kanu On The Weapon 8 - L27 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: Doryani and the Hooded One. Names worth rememberin', lad.
 ![[Kanu On The Weapon 8 - L28 - A1.ogg]]

Kanu: Yeah. Those fellas. Ah well. Good luck findin' the other piece. We got your back!
