Kaimana: I am working on a new elixir... another experiment, another concoction, hah! But I'm looking for an ingredient. Though it requires a little... bravery, to fetch. Travel to Whakapanu Island. Seek a great shark. Then... see what you can... acquire... and bring it back here! Then I'll see what I can do with it!

Kaimana: The Blood Fever... Tavakai insists we bring it to an end, yes. And that is my critical task. It is said... the great shark of Whakapanu Island contains unique blood. I must at least try!
