# Kaimana On Kitava 4

Kaimana: Why do you speak of Kitava here? It was {our} Tukohama that gave him his scars!

Matiki: Those cultists that massacred Oriath were no {Ngakuramakoi.} They were... undesirables.

Witch: How convenient for you.

Sorceress: Ah, much like the Faridun.

Huntress: They were cast out? Or driven away?

Monk: Are we not all beholden to each other?

Mercenary: So that's why you never tried to free them.

Druid: And castin' 'em out... did that not make 'em what they became?

Tavakai: The cult of Kitava grew like a tumour, when we allowed our culture to weaken. Kitava would have consumed the world. Had I been of age, I would have slain him myself. Let them all rot, forgotten.
