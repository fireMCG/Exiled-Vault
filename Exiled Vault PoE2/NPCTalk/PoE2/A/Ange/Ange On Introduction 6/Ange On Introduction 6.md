# Ange On Introduction 6

Ange: Oh... hello. Yes, yes, I'm Ange. A marketeer! Oh gosh, where are my notes? I'm terrible at introductions... Never mind!

Ranger: Don't worry. I don't do well at introductions either.

Ange: Oh, thank goodness. A kindred spirit!

Ange: I've been in Kingsmarch for many years. Watching and waiting for my time to shine. Picked up a thing or two from Rog and Faustus, rest his soul... ...and a little life advice from Tujen... I guess. If you need to get your hands on something... or get something... off your hands... just ask!

Mercenary: I ain't no dummy. What's the catch?

Druid: And ye'd do this out o' the kindness o' yer heart?

Ange: I'll take a small fee, not much at all really... But first order of business... we need somewhere to set up a sort of base of operations. A hideout, you might say! To ship goods to and from. I'll keep it all spick and span, don't worry... just keep an eye out for a suitable location. Somewhere... out of sight. Off the beaten track! If you get my drift.
