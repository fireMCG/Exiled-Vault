Monk: I see. He does seem undisciplined.

Mercenary: Aw, come on. He's a nice fella.

Ange: Too fair, you might say!
 ![[Ange On Learning From Rog 4 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Ange: Years ago, he'd drive a hard bargain. He was a great negotiator. Then he went and had children... ugh. Awful. Now he seemingly doesn't have the energy to haggle. Almost gives stuff away!
