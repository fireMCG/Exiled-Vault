Warrior: I'm sorry to hear that your mentor died.

Witch: This Faustus. He's dead then?
 ![[Ange On Learning From Faustus 6 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: You learned much from this Faustus fellow before he passed away?
 ![[Ange On Learning From Faustus 6 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: What became of this Faustus you mentioned?
 ![[Ange On Learning From Faustus 6 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: I'm sorry to hear your teacher, Faustus, is no longer with us.
 ![[Ange On Learning From Faustus 6 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Faustus, your mentor, has left this world, I take it?
 ![[Ange On Learning From Faustus 6 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: So this old fella, Faustus... he's dead then?
 ![[Ange On Learning From Faustus 6 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: This Faustus... I gather he's no longer with us.
 ![[Ange On Learning From Faustus 6 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Ange: A rather unwilling mentor, almost unaware he even was one actually... but thanks.
 ![[Ange On Learning From Faustus 6 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Ange: Oh, yes. Been dead a few years now.
 ![[Ange On Learning From Faustus 6 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Ange: I did. He was a complicated man, to say the least.
 ![[Ange On Learning From Faustus 6 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Ange: Well... he's dead. That's the short of it.
 ![[Ange On Learning From Faustus 6 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Ange: Wish I could the say the same! Between you and me, he could be quite grumpy in his later years...
 ![[Ange On Learning From Faustus 6 - L13 - A1.ogg]] ![[Ange On Learning From Faustus 6 - L13 - A2.ogg]]

Ange: You mean... he died? Yes. He's well and truly dead.
 ![[Ange On Learning From Faustus 6 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Ange: Very much so. Not a massive turnout at his funeral, I must say.
 ![[Ange On Learning From Faustus 6 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Ange: Afraid not. Not for a few years now.
 ![[Ange On Learning From Faustus 6 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Ange: Died of natural causes they say, but I'm not so sure... He left Kingsmarch around a decade ago. No one was entirely sure where he went. But when he got back... gosh. He really had changed. He'd both softened {and} hardened. You never quite knew which you'd get. But I could tell... it was caused by fear.

Warrior: And you didn't ever ask him about it?
 ![[Ange On Learning From Faustus 6 - L18 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: You didn't think to enquire about it?
 ![[Ange On Learning From Faustus 6 - L19 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Age can change us all. Why didn't you ask him about this?
 ![[Ange On Learning From Faustus 6 - L20 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Just sounds like another grumpy old man.
 ![[Ange On Learning From Faustus 6 - L21 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: I've met an Elder or two like that. Not so uncommon in their older years.
 ![[Ange On Learning From Faustus 6 - L22 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Perhaps he saw something in the world he wished he hadn't.
 ![[Ange On Learning From Faustus 6 - L23 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: It's always like that when you come back from holiday. It's hard to get back into the routine.
 ![[Ange On Learning From Faustus 6 - L24 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: Fear shapes a soul like water shapes stone.
 ![[Ange On Learning From Faustus 6 - L25 - A1.ogg]]

Ange: Oh yes. Very grumpy!
 ![[Ange On Learning From Faustus 6 - L26 - A1.ogg]]

Ange: Certainly, but he still had his mind. It was something else...
 ![[Ange On Learning From Faustus 6 - L27 - A1.ogg]]

Ange: I believe you are right.
 ![[Ange On Learning From Faustus 6 - L28 - A1.ogg]]

Ange: That's... not exactly what I mean.
 ![[Ange On Learning From Faustus 6 - L29 - A1.ogg]]

Ange: Yes... that's exactly it. Wore him down, but left sharp edges too.
 ![[Ange On Learning From Faustus 6 - L30 - A1.ogg]]

Ange: I asked him once. It took all my courage to do so. 'What happened to you, Faustus? Where did you go?' I asked. He looked me dead in the eye. I still remember the look he had on his face. He was looking at me, but also through me. Like he was somewhere else. Reliving something. He said nothing. Got up and left. They found his body later that night on the dock. Under his coat, he was clutching a small Vaal artefact. I heard he held it so tightly, his hands were bloody... All very strange.
