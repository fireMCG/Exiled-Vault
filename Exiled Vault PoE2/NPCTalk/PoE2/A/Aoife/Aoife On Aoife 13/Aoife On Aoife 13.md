# Aoife On Aoife 13

Druid: Aoife...? C-can it be?
 ![[Aoife On Aoife 13 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Aoife: Yes. I'm here, love.
 ![[Aoife On Aoife 13 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: But how...?
 ![[Aoife On Aoife 13 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Aoife: It matters not. Tell me... do you feel it? Your memories returning.
 ![[Aoife On Aoife 13 - L4 - A1.ogg]] ![[Aoife On Aoife 13 - L4 - A2.ogg]]

Druid: I feel it, aye. But they're... {fractured.} There's still so much I dinnae understand.
 ![[Aoife On Aoife 13 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Aoife: Remember how we were drawn to him... believing him one of the Maji of old.
 ![[Aoife On Aoife 13 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: Aye... we were fools...
 ![[Aoife On Aoife 13 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Aoife: Not fools... just deceived. Even I could not see the King's true face until it was too late. And when I did, he... took me from you.

Druid: I should have saved ye... I should have done more—
 ![[Aoife On Aoife 13 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Aoife: Hush... that is not your blame to carry. That grief made you wander the wilds, lost to all but your own pain.
 ![[Aoife On Aoife 13 - L10 - A1.ogg]] ![[Aoife On Aoife 13 - L10 - A2.ogg]]

Druid: I... remember... years of solitude... roaming...
 ![[Aoife On Aoife 13 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Aoife: And yet here you are. That is what matters.
 ![[Aoife On Aoife 13 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: Nay... none of it matters. Not without you.
