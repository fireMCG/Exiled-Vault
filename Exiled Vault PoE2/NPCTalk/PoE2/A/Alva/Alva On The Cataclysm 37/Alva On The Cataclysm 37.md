# Alva On The Cataclysm 37

Alva: In my readings, accounts of the Cataclysm are scattered, as one might expect. Some say it began here. Some say it happened at the mountain we now call Highgate. Supposedly, it had something to do with Atziri's obsession with immortality, but that's all the survivors knew. The Empire died in a single night. Only three thousand, one-hundred, and twenty-six Vaal survived to reach the Azmeri mountains...

Druid: A few escaped to the Wildwood by pure chance... but they didnae last long. It was already too late.

Alva: What happened to them?
 ![[Alva On The Cataclysm 37 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: They met a terrible fate.
 ![[Alva On The Cataclysm 37 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Alva: Ooh, I want details!
 ![[Alva On The Cataclysm 37 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: You'll not get them from me.
 ![[Alva On The Cataclysm 37 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Alva: Aw, {fine}.
 ![[Alva On The Cataclysm 37 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: That is the price of meddling with forces one doesn't understand.
 ![[Alva On The Cataclysm 37 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Alva: Don't you do that rather often?
 ![[Alva On The Cataclysm 37 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: I meddle, yes, but I also make sure I {understand} first.
 ![[Alva On The Cataclysm 37 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Alva: Really? You've never reached beyond your grasp even a {little?}
 ![[Alva On The Cataclysm 37 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Maybe a little...
 ![[Alva On The Cataclysm 37 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: If we learn more about their Cataclysm, perhaps we could stop another.
 ![[Alva On The Cataclysm 37 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Alva: That's history for you. It's got all the answers, if you're willing to look.

Sorceress: We knew little of the event itself. From what is told, the sky to the south raged with crimson fire, and the moon turned to blood. Scouts that returned in the following days died soon after telling us the Vaal were simply gone. Their lands became forbidden, and still are today... mostly. We've been dealing with the consequences of Corruption ever since.

Alva: Intriguing! I've never thought about the Maraketh perspective on all this.

Shadow: [DNT]

Alva: [DNT]

Monk: And Wraeclast is still suffering from the consequences to this day.

Templar: [DNT]

Ranger: So much suffering. So much pain. It's still harming the world to this day.
 ![[Alva On The Cataclysm 37 - L25 - A1.ogg]]

Alva: The legacy of the Vaal might always be with us...
 ![[Alva On The Cataclysm 37 - L26 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: As the elders tell it, my people were happy to take them in. They'd always been kind to us.
 ![[Alva On The Cataclysm 37 - L27 - A1.ogg]]

Alva: I'm glad. Such charity, in the face of such horror...

Mercenary: How many were there before?
 ![[Alva On The Cataclysm 37 - L32 - A1.ogg]]

Alva: If I had to guess, I'd wager... millions.
 ![[Alva On The Cataclysm 37 - L33 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Oof, millions. That's a tough record to beat.
 ![[Alva On The Cataclysm 37 - L34 - A1.ogg]]

Alva: Record?
 ![[Alva On The Cataclysm 37 - L35 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Yeh. It's a soldier's game, to keep your mind. Confirmed kills.
 ![[Alva On The Cataclysm 37 - L36 - A1.ogg]]

Alva: I'm sorry, are you competing with the legendary Queen Atziri for {number of kills?}
 ![[Alva On The Cataclysm 37 - L37 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: I {said} it's a tough one to beat.
 ![[Alva On The Cataclysm 37 - L38 - A1.ogg]]

Alva: You are absolutely... ridiculous...
