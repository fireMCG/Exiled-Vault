# Alva On The Dream 2

Alva: I had another dream... well, more like a nightmare. I was running through a glade, chasing a rabbit, but no matter what, I couldn't catch it. It fled into a stump, and disappeared into darkness... while I was peering down, something loomed above me. A horned creature. Emaciated. I could see its shadow fall over me but... it seemed impossible. It was like the shadow came from... below. When I finally met its gaze, I expected horror, but instead, I was blinded by a void. My eyes were open, yet I saw only... eternity. A creature reached out its claw and cut deeply into my forehead. Countless screaming voices poured into my mind. Then... I woke. Disturbed, but... still myself. What do you think it means?
