# Alva On The Dream 5

Alva: I believe I had the final dream. I think I felt... divinity, as crazy as that sounds.

Ranger: Divinity? What was it like?
 ![[Alva On The Dream 5 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: I'm listenin'.
 ![[Alva On The Dream 5 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Perhaps the memory of a god. Go on.
 ![[Alva On The Dream 5 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Tell me {everything.}
 ![[Alva On The Dream 5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Perhaps not as crazy as you think. Now... finish the tale.
 ![[Alva On The Dream 5 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: Tell me more.
 ![[Alva On The Dream 5 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: I've heard crazier. Go on then.

Alva: In the dream, I was hollow. Completely empty. I was a liar. A torturer. A deceiver. I'd perfected the art of contorting reality to my will, purely to bring untold misery upon the world. Perhaps strangest of all, I had a... portal of sorts... in my forehead. A gateway from my mind to the world. Where all the horrors I imagined could be made real... I think I'm done with those splinters. I don't want to know anymore.

Ranger: It must be {his} memories. The Black Crow.
 ![[Alva On The Dream 5 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: I know it, now. It's {his} memories. How he came to be... the Raven.
 ![[Alva On The Dream 5 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: The memories of a dark god. The one tormenting us.
 ![[Alva On The Dream 5 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Ah, it's the trickster's memories!
 ![[Alva On The Dream 5 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I see. It is the tale of the trickster. The Raven himself.
 ![[Alva On The Dream 5 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: It's him. {His} memories. The strange voice is... the Black Crow.
 ![[Alva On The Dream 5 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: That must be the strange voice. His memories.
 ![[Alva On The Dream 5 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Alva: The completed object... when the splinters are reassembled... it's a fruit. A stone carving of a fruit we used to gather from the shore. Sweet and juicy, like summer, now lost forever... Sorry, what {they} used to gather...
