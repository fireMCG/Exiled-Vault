Huntress: A kindred spirit, then.
 ![[Alva On Kishara's Spoils 27 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Alva: I do look up to her! But there's something I've always wondered...
 ![[Alva On Kishara's Spoils 27 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I was taught that Kishara was captain of a Maraketh merchant vessel. You're saying she was Vaal?
 ![[Alva On Kishara's Spoils 27 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Alva: That's curious. Her treasures {are} here, but I suppose that doesn't prove anything...

Monk: Kishara? This name is unfamiliar to me.
 ![[Alva On Kishara's Spoils 27 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Alva: Would you say it... doesn't ring a bell?
 ![[Alva On Kishara's Spoils 27 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: It does not.
 ![[Alva On Kishara's Spoils 27 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Templar: [DNT]

Druid: Aye. My memory's faint, but... I believe she visited the Wildwood to trade, when I was still a young buck. Lively one, she was.
 ![[Alva On Kishara's Spoils 27 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Alva: Excuse me? Just how old are you?
 ![[Alva On Kishara's Spoils 27 - L18 - A1.ogg]]

Druid: Not as old as you're thinkin'. Time just runs a bit differently there. I always wondered what became o' her.
 ![[Alva On Kishara's Spoils 27 - L19 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Never heard of her.
 ![[Alva On Kishara's Spoils 27 - L20 - A1.ogg]]

Alva: Kishara, the Southern Star? The Wayward Gull? Her seventeen children founded the Brinerot pirate band?
 ![[Alva On Kishara's Spoils 27 - L21 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Still haven't—wait, {seventeen?} How? When did she even have time?
 ![[Alva On Kishara's Spoils 27 - L22 - A1.ogg]]

Alva: She was renowned for manning the helm while pregnant, and giving birth during battles.
 ![[Alva On Kishara's Spoils 27 - L23 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: {Battles?} It happened multiple times?
 ![[Alva On Kishara's Spoils 27 - L24 - A1.ogg]]

Alva: Let's not get distracted. This treasure could be the find of... some century!
 ![[Alva On Kishara's Spoils 27 - L25 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Heh heh. The Brinerot sure tell some lurid tales o' her.
 ![[Alva On Kishara's Spoils 27 - L26 - A1.ogg]]

Alva: Keep your trousers on. She's a respected figure! And this treasure...
 ![[Alva On Kishara's Spoils 27 - L27 - A1.ogg]]

Alva: Popular writings claimed she sailed all the way to Middengard on her last voyage. Supposedly, Queen Atziri didn't like all the attention Kishara was getting, so she impounded everything she brought back and executed her crew... Oh, I can't wait to see if the myth is true!
