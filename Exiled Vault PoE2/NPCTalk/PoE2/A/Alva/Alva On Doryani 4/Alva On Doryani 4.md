# Alva On Doryani 4

Alva: Well, he wasn't the worst captor I've ever had... and I suppose, he did save us back there. At least it {appears} he is on your side for now... But you shouldn't forget who he is and all he has done. There is something eerily cold and calculating about him.

Ranger: Just another person I won't trust or understand.
 ![[Alva On Doryani 4 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Seems there's no sacrifice too large if it meant saving his people. I can {almost} understand that.

Monk: Through the looking glass of history, it is easy to judge someone's actions.

Witch: Cold and calculating? Hmmmm...
 ![[Alva On Doryani 4 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Yes, I know what you mean... His reputation precedes him, but this skinny Vaal man does not frighten me.

Warrior: History says he was a monster... Or... {is} a monster.

Mercenary: Yeah. A man of ambition. Killing his people while trying to save them. A complicated fella.

Druid: Cold, aye. But hungry.
Hunger makes a man dangerous.

Alva: You needn't try to understand him... Not trusting him sounds fine though!
 ![[Alva On Doryani 4 - L10 - A1.ogg]] ![[Alva On Doryani 4 - L10 - A2.ogg]]

Alva: Almost, yes. But certainly not the lengths to which he went.
 ![[Alva On Doryani 4 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Alva: That sounds quite wise. In any case...
 ![[Alva On Doryani 4 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Alva: Ew!
 ![[Alva On Doryani 4 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Alva: True enough.
 ![[Alva On Doryani 4 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Alva: Complicated indeed.
 ![[Alva On Doryani 4 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Alva: I believe he will aid you so long as your goals align with his. The moment they do not... I'm just saying, don't turn your back on him.
