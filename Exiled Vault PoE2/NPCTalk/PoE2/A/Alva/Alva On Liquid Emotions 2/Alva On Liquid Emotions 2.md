Monk: How is this possible? It's a jar of... undisciplined, but concentrated emotions.

Witch: Distilling emotions is rather insane, even for me. Do you know anything about this?

Sorceress: The Maraketh evoke emotions with tales, but someone tried to do it much more... directly. What sorcery is this?

Alva: Hmm... we once excavated a ruin where the engraved pictures told a peculiar story. It appeared as if they were teaching their children new knowledge by imbuing emotions in a piece of jewelry. It was a very old ruin, but... maybe the distilled energy you found is a remnant of that lost culture. If you find a few more, you might be able to instill knowledge in something yourself...
