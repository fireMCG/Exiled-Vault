# Alva On The Dream 3

Alva: I had a more coherent dream after working with a larger number of splinters... I saw a feast. A peaceful, tranquil place. I felt... smiles. I felt calm.

Alva: I didn't get the impression that this was part of a vast empire, or a grand civilisation, or anything like that. Just a rare haven from the world's ills. I really wish I could have written it down... but it's gone. I can't hold on to the sensations...
