# Alva On Fortress 3

Alva: At first it seemed there was nothing in the historical record about that strange pillar of flame you found... But then it occurred to me... a great deal has been written about times of ash. Fires that scorched the land, clouds that blotted out the sun, the Winter of the World...

Ranger: But why is it here now?

Huntress: But what's it mean?

Monk: It is still a curious time to see it.

Witch: Makes you wonder, why has it showed up now... how ominous.

Sorceress: The timing of this seems mysterious. The question we must ask is, why do we see this now?

Warrior: But where has it come from?

Mercenary: Yeah... but why's it showin' up now?

Druid: That was long ago... Why now?

Alva: If that place is somehow connected to those times of ash, then perhaps we have quite the problem on our hands. As if we didn't have enough already! I fear... it may have ended entire civilisations. It may have ended the world as we know it. You really must get in there first. Everything could depend upon it.
