# Alva On Lira Vaal 14

Alva: This was the capital of the Vaal Empire for much of its history, but some sort of... incident... burned much of it down. After that, Azala Vaal became the seat of power, until Queen Atziri returned the royal court to Lira Vaal and rebuilt it. Atziri's treasure vaults are legendary! I can only hope they're somewhere inside...
