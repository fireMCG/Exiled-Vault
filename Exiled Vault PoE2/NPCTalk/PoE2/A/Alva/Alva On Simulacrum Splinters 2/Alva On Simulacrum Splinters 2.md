Huntress: Had quite the vision, but it weren't from the Spirit. Summat to do with this Splinter?

Witch: Tell me, darling, what you make of this bewitching splinter.

Warrior: The Black Crow tried to deceive me. My attack chipped off this strange splinter from his... manifestations.

Alva: Let me see... this marking... we've come across it in our excavations. In context, it was treated as something quite negative, something Karui myths referred to as 'sealed away,' or 'imprisoned.' If this is related to that entity you released near Journey's End... whatever it is, it's now fixated on you. You should try to gather more of these splinters. With enough of them, perhaps we can decipher the story of these markings. As a treasure hunter, I know: the past holds all the answers, if you're willing to look hard enough.
