The Hooded One: Ngamakanui. Interesting... We must make haste.

Alva: Well then... how about I take you and your merry friends to Kingsmarch? The port town is within the area of Ngamakanui. From there you can charter a ship from my contact and begin your search. We've quite a haul of treasure we've {borrowed} from Utzaal... It will more than cover the charter cost.

The Hooded One: Hmm. Kingsmarch would indeed be a wise location from which to base ourselves.
 ![[Alva On Kingsmarch 7 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Alva: Great! We can leave whenever you're ready, just let me know.
