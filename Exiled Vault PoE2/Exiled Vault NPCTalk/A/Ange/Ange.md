## Ange on The End Of The World /3
Ange: Well... we didn't die. Not yet at least.
 ![[Ange - Ange on The End Of The World _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: Not yet, indeed.
 ![[Ange - Ange on The End Of The World _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Gosh. Cheer up. You're welcome.
 ![[Ange - Ange on The End Of The World _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: We continue to live. We are fortunate.
 ![[Ange - Ange on The End Of The World _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Anything could happen, at any time.
 ![[Ange - Ange on The End Of The World _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Live to hunt another day.
 ![[Ange - Ange on The End Of The World _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: We move forwards. It is all that matters.
 ![[Ange - Ange on The End Of The World _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: It was a close one. To be sure.
 ![[Ange - Ange on The End Of The World _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Ange: Trade might be challenging now, given the circumstances... But don't worry! I'll make it happen!
 ![[Ange - Ange on The End Of The World _3 - L9 - A1.ogg]] ![[Ange - Ange on The End Of The World _3 - L9 - A2.ogg]]


## Ange on Singing Caverns /1
Ange: You cleared out all the... {problems}... on Whakapanu Island. Quite remarkable really! I've had a look around there, scoped out a good spot for us to base ourselves. Shall we go take a look?

## Ange on The End Of The World /3
Ange: Yes, yes. I've picked up that you're on some grand quest to save us all. Oblivion doesn't bother me, really... As long as I go out on a pile of gold and success!
 ![[Ange - Ange on The End Of The World _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Ange - Ange on The End Of The World _3 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Ange - Ange on The End Of The World _3 - L1 - A3.ogg]]

Warrior: You better make your gold quick then...
 ![[Ange - Ange on The End Of The World _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: That's the spirit! There really is nothing to fear in death.
 ![[Ange - Ange on The End Of The World _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Gold cannot follow you in death. It is meaningless.
 ![[Ange - Ange on The End Of The World _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Whatever makes you happy, I 'spose.
 ![[Ange - Ange on The End Of The World _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Oh, come now, there's more to life than that, Ange.
 ![[Ange - Ange on The End Of The World _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Gold and fame are fools endeavours.
 ![[Ange - Ange on The End Of The World _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: You know what, that's exactly how I feel.
 ![[Ange - Ange on The End Of The World _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Ange: Well, I've run out of hope in finding a life companion... so gold will have to do.
 ![[Ange - Ange on The End Of The World _3 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

## Ange on Introduction /6
Ange: Oh... hello. Yes, yes, I'm Ange. A marketeer! Oh gosh, where are my notes? I'm terrible at introductions... Never mind!
 ![[Ange - Ange on Introduction _6 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Ange - Ange on Introduction _6 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

Ranger: Don't worry. I don't do well at introductions either.
 ![[Ange - Ange on Introduction _6 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Ange: Oh, thank goodness. A kindred spirit!
 ![[Ange - Ange on Introduction _6 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Ange: I've been in Kingsmarch for many years. Watching and waiting for my time to shine. Picked up a thing or two from Rog and Faustus, rest his soul... ...and a little life advice from Tujen... I guess. If you need to get your hands on something... or get something... off your hands... just ask!
 ![[Ange - Ange on Introduction _6 - L4 - A1.ogg]] ![[Ange - Ange on Introduction _6 - L4 - A2.ogg]] ![[Ange - Ange on Introduction _6 - L4 - A3.ogg]] ![[Ange - Ange on Introduction _6 - L4 - A4.ogg]]

Warrior: How do I reimburse you for your service?
 ![[Ange - Ange on Introduction _6 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Surely there's more to it than that.
 ![[Ange - Ange on Introduction _6 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Calm yourself, woman. I mean you no harm. How does this work?
 ![[Ange - Ange on Introduction _6 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Sounds good to me. What's the cost?
 ![[Ange - Ange on Introduction _6 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: I'm interested. What do your services cost?
 ![[Ange - Ange on Introduction _6 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: I ain't no dummy. What's the catch?
 ![[Ange - Ange on Introduction _6 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Ange: I'll take a small fee, not much at all really... But first order of business... we need somewhere to set up a sort of base of operations. A hideout, you might say! To ship goods to and from. I'll keep it all spick and span, don't worry... just keep an eye out for a suitable location. Somewhere... out of sight. Off the beaten track! If you get my drift.
 ![[Ange - Ange on Introduction _6 - L11 - A1.ogg]] ![[Ange - Ange on Introduction _6 - L11 - A2.ogg]] ![[Ange - Ange on Introduction _6 - L11 - A3.ogg]] ![[Ange - Ange on Introduction _6 - L11 - A4.ogg]] ![[Ange - Ange on Introduction _6 - L11 - A5.ogg]]


## Ange on Hideouts /1
Ange: A place of our own. Somewhere to make history from. If only my parents could see me now... Thanks for believing in me. I won't let you down!

## Ange on Learning From Faustus /6
Warrior: I'm sorry to hear that your mentor died.
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Faustus _6 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: This Faustus. He's dead then?
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Faustus _6 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: You learned much from this Faustus fellow before he passed away?
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Faustus _6 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: What became of this Faustus you mentioned?
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Faustus _6 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: I'm sorry to hear your teacher, Faustus, is no longer with us.
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Faustus _6 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Faustus, your mentor, has left this world, I take it?
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Faustus _6 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: So this old fella, Faustus... he's dead then?
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Faustus _6 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Ange: A rather unwilling mentor, almost unaware he even was one actually... but thanks.
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Faustus _6 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Ange: Oh, yes. Been dead a few years now.
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Faustus _6 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Ange: I did. He was a complicated man, to say the least.
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Faustus _6 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Ange: Well... he's dead. That's the short of it.
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Faustus _6 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Ange: Wish I could the say the same! Between you and me, he could be quite grumpy in his later years...
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Faustus _6 - L12 - A1.ogg]] ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Faustus _6 - L12 - A2.ogg]]

Ange: You mean... he died? Yes. He's well and truly dead.
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Faustus _6 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Ange: Very much so. Not a massive turnout at his funeral, I must say.
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Faustus _6 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Ange: Died of natural causes they say, but I'm not so sure... He left Kingsmarch around a decade ago. No one was entirely sure where he went. But when he got back... gosh. He really had changed. He'd both softened {and} hardened. You never quite knew which you'd get. But I could tell... it was caused by fear.
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Faustus _6 - L15 - A1.ogg]] ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Faustus _6 - L15 - A2.ogg]] ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Faustus _6 - L15 - A3.ogg]] ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Faustus _6 - L15 - A4.ogg]] ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Faustus _6 - L15 - A5.ogg]] ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Faustus _6 - L15 - A6.ogg]]

Warrior: And you didn't ever ask him about it?
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Faustus _6 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: You didn't think to enquire about it?
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Faustus _6 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Age can change us all. Why didn't you ask him about this?
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Faustus _6 - L18 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Just sounds like another grumpy old man.
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Faustus _6 - L19 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: I've met an Elder or two like that. Not so uncommon in their older years.
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Faustus _6 - L20 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Perhaps he saw something in the world he wished he hadn't.
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Faustus _6 - L21 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: It's always like that when you come back from holiday. It's hard to get back into the routine.
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Faustus _6 - L22 - A1.ogg]]

Ange: Oh yes. Very grumpy!
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Faustus _6 - L23 - A1.ogg]]

Ange: Certainly, but he still had his mind. It was something else...
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Faustus _6 - L24 - A1.ogg]]

Ange: I believe you are right.
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Faustus _6 - L25 - A1.ogg]]

Ange: That's... not exactly what I mean.
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Faustus _6 - L26 - A1.ogg]]

Ange: I asked him once. It took all my courage to do so. 'What happened to you, Faustus? Where did you go?' I asked. He looked me dead in the eye. I still remember the look he had on his face. He was looking at me, but also through me. Like he was somewhere else. Reliving something. He said nothing. Got up and left. They found his body later that night on the dock. Under his coat, he was clutching a small Vaal artefact. I heard he held it so tightly, his hands were bloody... All very strange.
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Faustus _6 - L27 - A1.ogg]] ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Faustus _6 - L27 - A2.ogg]] ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Faustus _6 - L27 - A3.ogg]] ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Faustus _6 - L27 - A4.ogg]] ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Faustus _6 - L27 - A5.ogg]] ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Faustus _6 - L27 - A6.ogg]] ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Faustus _6 - L27 - A7.ogg]] ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Faustus _6 - L27 - A8.ogg]]


## Ange on Learning From Rog /4
Ange: He's been a great teacher. No doubt about it. But gosh, has he gotten soft as he's aged.
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Rog _4 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Rog _4 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

Warrior: He seems like a fair man.
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Rog _4 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Do you mean... plump?
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Rog _4 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: He seems like a gentleman to me.
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Rog _4 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: In what sense? He seemed perfectly normal to me.
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Rog _4 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Got a big heart, that one. Nothing wrong with that.
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Rog _4 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: I see. He does seem undisciplined.
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Rog _4 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Aw, come on. He's a nice fella.
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Rog _4 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Ange: Too fair, you might say!
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Rog _4 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Ange: What? No! Gosh.
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Rog _4 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Ange: Oh, he surely is! But you see...
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Rog _4 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Ange: Yes. Frightfully normal.
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Rog _4 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Ange: I agree. But... business is business.
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Rog _4 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Ange: I'm not sure you took my meaning...
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Rog _4 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Ange: Yes. Nice indeed. But making friends and making coin are different things.
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Rog _4 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Ange: Years ago, he'd drive a hard bargain. He was a great negotiator. Then he went and had children... ugh. Awful. Now he seemingly doesn't have the energy to haggle. Almost gives stuff away!
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Rog _4 - L16 - A1.ogg]] ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Rog _4 - L16 - A2.ogg]] ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Rog _4 - L16 - A3.ogg]] ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Rog _4 - L16 - A4.ogg]]


## Ange on Learning From Tujen /5
Ange: He helped me with my self-confidence... Well, at least he tried to. He got me blind drunk, singing songs with the local crews here in the tavern.
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Tujen _5 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Tujen _5 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

Warrior: I'm getting the impression... he has a problem.
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Tujen _5 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: The child with a beard should stop drinking.
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Tujen _5 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Master Tujen must pace himself with his drinking...
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Tujen _5 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Getting drunk is no solution to a problem.
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Tujen _5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Ha! Sounds like a good night out.
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Tujen _5 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: How childish.
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Tujen _5 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Haha! What a bloody legend.
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Tujen _5 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Ange: Yes... it is a bit of a worry.
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Tujen _5 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Ange: Yes... I suppose.
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Tujen _5 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Ange: Since then, for some reason, people have been more friendly towards me. Aren't people awfully strange?
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Tujen _5 - L11 - A1.ogg]] ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Tujen _5 - L11 - A2.ogg]]

Ranger: They certainly are.
 ![[Ange - Ange on Learning From Tujen _5 - L12 - A1.ogg]]


## Ange on Intruders /1
Ange: Hmm... it seems there's some rather intrusive wildlife around. Well, we can't have that can we? Maybe you could... move them on?
 ![[Ange - Ange on Intruders _1 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Ange - Ange on Intruders _1 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Ange - Ange on Intruders _1 - L1 - A3.ogg]]


## Ange on Hideout /1
Ange: Well done! So... what do you think? I love it! The pier could go there... store the supplies up the shore a bit... Our own little trade empire in the making! Well, what do you say? Shall we do it?
 ![[Ange - Ange on Hideout _1 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Ange - Ange on Hideout _1 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Ange - Ange on Hideout _1 - L1 - A3.ogg]] ![[Ange - Ange on Hideout _1 - L1 - A4.ogg]] ![[Ange - Ange on Hideout _1 - L1 - A5.ogg]] ![[Ange - Ange on Hideout _1 - L1 - A6.ogg]]
