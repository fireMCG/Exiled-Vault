## Alva on Cataclysm /3
Alva: I briefly saw. the sky... and the people... they were... well... Let's just say, I now understand why Vaal ruins look the way they do.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Cataclysm _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Alva - Alva on Cataclysm _3 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

Ranger: It cannot be unseen. I pity you.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Cataclysm _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: No one should see such a thing.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Cataclysm _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: You may never forget what you saw.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Cataclysm _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I can't imagine what you saw. And I am sorry you had to see it.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Cataclysm _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: It must've been... horrible.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Cataclysm _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Kinda thing you won't ever forget.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Cataclysm _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Alva: It was unreal. Unlike anything I could have imagined. But it all happened so fast... Perhaps {that} was a blessing.

## Alva on Doryani /4
Alva: Well, he wasn't the worst captor I've ever had... and I suppose, he did save us back there. At least it {appears} he is on your side for now... But you shouldn't forget who he is and all he has done. There is something eerily cold and calculating about him.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Doryani _4 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Alva - Alva on Doryani _4 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Alva - Alva on Doryani _4 - L1 - A3.ogg]] ![[Alva - Alva on Doryani _4 - L1 - A4.ogg]]

Ranger: Just another person I won't trust or understand.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Doryani _4 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Seems there's no sacrifice too large if it meant saving his people. I can {almost} understand that.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Doryani _4 - L3 - A1.ogg]] ![[Alva - Alva on Doryani _4 - L3 - A2.ogg]]

Monk: Through the looking glass of history, it is easy to judge someone's actions.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Doryani _4 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Cold and calculating? Hmmmm...
 ![[Alva - Alva on Doryani _4 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Yes, I know what you mean... His reputation precedes him, but this skinny Vaal man does not frighten me.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Doryani _4 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: History says he was a monster... Or... {is} a monster.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Doryani _4 - L7 - A1.ogg]] ![[Alva - Alva on Doryani _4 - L7 - A2.ogg]]

Mercenary: Yeah. A man of ambition. Killing his people while trying to save them. A complicated fella.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Doryani _4 - L8 - A1.ogg]] ![[Alva - Alva on Doryani _4 - L8 - A2.ogg]]

Alva: You needn't try to understand him... Not trusting him sounds fine though!
 ![[Alva - Alva on Doryani _4 - L9 - A1.ogg]] ![[Alva - Alva on Doryani _4 - L9 - A2.ogg]]

Alva: Almost, yes. But certainly not the lengths to which he went.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Doryani _4 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Alva: That sounds quite wise. In any case...
 ![[Alva - Alva on Doryani _4 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Alva: Ew!
 ![[Alva - Alva on Doryani _4 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Alva: True enough.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Doryani _4 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Alva: Complicated indeed.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Doryani _4 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Alva: I believe he will aid you so long as your goals align with his. The moment they do not... I'm just saying, don't turn your back on him.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Doryani _4 - L15 - A1.ogg]] ![[Alva - Alva on Doryani _4 - L15 - A2.ogg]]


## Alva on Kingsmarch /7
Alva: Oh good, you're alive! Well... that was quite the adventure, wasn't it?
 ![[Alva - Alva on Kingsmarch _7 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Alva - Alva on Kingsmarch _7 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

The Hooded One: Have you learned the location of the Weapon?
 ![[Alva - Alva on Kingsmarch _7 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: He has told me the Weapon is in pieces. One is around his neck. The others are scattered in a Karui archipelago.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Kingsmarch _7 - L3 - A1.ogg]] ![[Alva - Alva on Kingsmarch _7 - L3 - A2.ogg]]

Huntress: Aye. He mentioned the Weapon's in pieces. One piece is on him. The others, scattered around a Karui archipelago.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Kingsmarch _7 - L4 - A1.ogg]] ![[Alva - Alva on Kingsmarch _7 - L4 - A2.ogg]]

Monk: He has revealed the truth. The Weapon is in pieces. He retains one of them. The others are somewhere to be found in a Karui archipelago.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Kingsmarch _7 - L5 - A1.ogg]] ![[Alva - Alva on Kingsmarch _7 - L5 - A2.ogg]]

Witch: I have. But it has been split into pieces. The Royal Thaumaturge has one and claims the others are scattered around a Karui archipelago.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Kingsmarch _7 - L6 - A1.ogg]] ![[Alva - Alva on Kingsmarch _7 - L6 - A2.ogg]]

Sorceress: Doryani has informed me the Weapon is in pieces. He safeguards one piece, but the others are scattered around a Karui archipelago.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Kingsmarch _7 - L7 - A1.ogg]] ![[Alva - Alva on Kingsmarch _7 - L7 - A2.ogg]]

Warrior: Doryani claims it is in pieces. He holds one. But there are three others he says are scattered in a Karui archipelago.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Kingsmarch _7 - L8 - A1.ogg]] ![[Alva - Alva on Kingsmarch _7 - L8 - A2.ogg]]

Mercenary: Yep. The weapon ain't whole no more. Doryani's got a piece of it. The rest are scattered around some Karui archipelago.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Kingsmarch _7 - L9 - A1.ogg]] ![[Alva - Alva on Kingsmarch _7 - L9 - A2.ogg]]

The Hooded One: Ngamakanui. Interesting... We must make haste.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Kingsmarch _7 - L10 - A1.ogg]] ![[Alva - Alva on Kingsmarch _7 - L10 - A2.ogg]] ![[Alva - Alva on Kingsmarch _7 - L10 - A3.ogg]]

Alva: Well then... how about I take you and your merry friends to Kingsmarch? The port town is within the area of Ngamakanui. From there you can charter a ship from my contact and begin your search. We've quite a haul of treasure we've {borrowed} from Utzaal... It will more than cover the charter cost.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Kingsmarch _7 - L11 - A1.ogg]] ![[Alva - Alva on Kingsmarch _7 - L11 - A2.ogg]] ![[Alva - Alva on Kingsmarch _7 - L11 - A3.ogg]] ![[Alva - Alva on Kingsmarch _7 - L11 - A4.ogg]]

The Hooded One: Hmm. Kingsmarch would indeed be a wise location from which to base ourselves.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Kingsmarch _7 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Alva: Great! We can leave whenever you're ready, just let me know.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Kingsmarch _7 - L13 - A1.ogg]] ![[Alva - Alva on Kingsmarch _7 - L13 - A2.ogg]]


## Alva on Travel to Kingsmarch /1
Alva: It's a long journey... but relatively safe once we're clear of the jungle. The Kalguurans keep the road pretty secure. Shall we?
 ![[Alva - Alva on Travel to Kingsmarch _1 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Alva - Alva on Travel to Kingsmarch _1 - L1 - A2.ogg]]


## Alva on Kingsmarch /4
Rog, the Dealer: Is this the friend you mentioned?
 ![[Alva - Alva on Kingsmarch _4 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Alva: Ah, there you are! This is my contact Rog, a trader with a keen eye for valuable artefacts! Rog, my friends are after a ship... And it just so happens we've a cart load of Vaal treasure to cover the charter.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Kingsmarch _4 - L2 - A1.ogg]] ![[Alva - Alva on Kingsmarch _4 - L2 - A2.ogg]] ![[Alva - Alva on Kingsmarch _4 - L2 - A3.ogg]] ![[Alva - Alva on Kingsmarch _4 - L2 - A4.ogg]]

Huntress: My hunt leads me toward the most dangerous islands.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Kingsmarch _4 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: My path unfortunately leads me to your most dangerous islands.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Kingsmarch _4 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: We need a skilled Captain. We seek the most dangerous islands in the region.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Kingsmarch _4 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: What I'm looking for makes itself known with danger. It may be on several islands.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Kingsmarch _4 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I need a guide - someone capable of taking me to your most dangerous islands.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Kingsmarch _4 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: We're looking for something that can only be found on the most dangerous islands.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Kingsmarch _4 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Apparently, we're looking to head right to the most dangerous islands.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Kingsmarch _4 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Rog, the Dealer: Hmm, Kalguuran merchant vessels don't intentionally seek out danger. However... there is one Captain who may be up to the task. Name's Makoru. I'll set up an account for you, but for now, here is your charter. Take it to her. I've no doubt she'll accept.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Kingsmarch _4 - L10 - A1.ogg]] ![[Alva - Alva on Kingsmarch _4 - L10 - A2.ogg]]


## Alva on Kingsmarch /1
Alva: I suppose it's time we said farewell, for now. I'm off to study a tome on Blood Magic I... found... back in Utzaal. How exciting!
 ![[Alva - Alva on Kingsmarch _1 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Alva - Alva on Kingsmarch _1 - L1 - A2.ogg]]


## Alva on Defeated Simulacrum /2
Alva: You beat that shadowy entity at his own game! Maybe now he'll stop frequenting our minds and tormenting us with all those whispers and shadows... That {was} him, right...?
 ![[Alva - Alva on Defeated Simulacrum _2 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Alva - Alva on Defeated Simulacrum _2 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

Ranger: Sometimes prey plays dead. Time will tell.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Defeated Simulacrum _2 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: I sure hope it were that simple.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Defeated Simulacrum _2 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Yes. I defeated him soundly.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Defeated Simulacrum _2 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Oh, this is far from over, dear. But don't worry. He's been put back under his stump.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Defeated Simulacrum _2 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: This tale is still being told. We shall have to see.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Defeated Simulacrum _2 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: It was a victory, but... I can't be sure.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Defeated Simulacrum _2 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Yeah! Yeah it was him. I'm pretty sure it was.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Defeated Simulacrum _2 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Yeah! Yeah it was him. I'm pretty sure it was.

## Alva on Corruption /3
Alva: If it helps, history does tell of a slow recovery after a Cataclysm. It will likely take some time to set things right.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Corruption _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Alva - Alva on Corruption _3 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

Ranger: Things will never be the same, Alva.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Corruption _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: {Rathin} plagues the world now. Spirit protect me mountainborn.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Corruption _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]] ![[Alva - Alva on Corruption _3 - L3 - A2.ogg]]

Monk: Things are in motion. We must move with them and... adjust.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Corruption _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Set things right? The world is doomed, foolish girl.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Corruption _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: This is the worst possible outcome... but I remain resolute. We mustn't give up.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Corruption _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: Will we even see the world cured?
 ![[Alva - Alva on Corruption _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: I dunno if we can set this right, love.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Corruption _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Alva: Every bit of Corruption you cleanse helps rebuild the Wraeclast we knew. We've at least got to try.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Corruption _3 - L9 - A1.ogg]] ![[Alva - Alva on Corruption _3 - L9 - A2.ogg]]

## Alva on The Dream /1
Alva: As I've studied these grey splinters you found, I've come to believe that they have a kind of knowledge imbued in them. It's fragmented, of course. Not enough to glean a conscious thought. But I keep having dreams... nothing coherent yet... but I'll let you know...

## Alva on The Dream /3
Alva: I had a more coherent dream after working with a larger number of splinters... I saw a feast. A peaceful, tranquil place. I felt... smiles. I felt calm.
 ![[Alva - Alva on The Dream _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Alva - Alva on The Dream _3 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

Ranger: Was that in a forest? Or a village?
 ![[Alva - Alva on The Dream _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Sounds like home.
 ![[Alva - Alva on The Dream _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: A good feeling, in a dark time. Where was this place?
 ![[Alva - Alva on The Dream _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: That can't be anywhere on Wraeclast.
 ![[Alva - Alva on The Dream _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Sounds like home. Was it the Vastiri?
 ![[Alva - Alva on The Dream _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: A memory of peace. Do you know where it was?
 ![[Alva - Alva on The Dream _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: So it was a dream, then. Can't imagine where that would be.
 ![[Alva - Alva on The Dream _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Alva: I didn't get the impression that this was part of a vast empire, or a grand civilisation, or anything like that. Just a rare haven from the world's ills. I really wish I could have written it down... but it's gone. I can't hold on to the sensations...

## Alva on The Dream /2
Alva: I had another dream... well, more like a nightmare. I was running through a glade, chasing a rabbit, but no matter what, I couldn't catch it. It fled into a stump, and disappeared into darkness... while I was peering down, something loomed above me. A horned creature. Emaciated. I could see its shadow fall over me but... it seemed impossible. It was like the shadow came from... below. When I finally met its gaze, I expected horror, but instead, I was blinded by a void. My eyes were open, yet I saw only... eternity. A creature reached out its claw and cut deeply into my forehead. Countless screaming voices poured into my mind. Then... I woke. Disturbed, but... still myself. What do you think it means?

 ![[Alva - Alva on The Dream _2 - L3 - A1.ogg]] ![[Alva - Alva on The Dream _2 - L3 - A2.ogg]]

Monk: It's an ominous sign of evil.
 ![[Alva - Alva on The Dream _2 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: I don't know what it means, but I'm excited.
 ![[Alva - Alva on The Dream _2 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I believe this is someone else's tale, conveyed to you by {their} memory. Try to remember every detail. It could be important.
 ![[Alva - Alva on The Dream _2 - L6 - A1.ogg]] ![[Alva - Alva on The Dream _2 - L6 - A2.ogg]]

Warrior: I think you need some rest. Whatever that nightmare means, I'll handle it.

Mercenary: I think it means... you took a sip of the wrong drink, love.

Alva: In the dream, I was hollow. Completely empty. I was a liar. A torturer. A deceiver. I'd perfected the art of contorting reality to my will, purely to bring untold misery upon the world. Perhaps strangest of all, I had a... portal of sorts... in my forehead. A gateway from my mind to the world. Where all the horrors I imagined could be made real... I think I'm done with those splinters. I don't want to know anymore.

Mercenary: That must be the strange voice. His memories.

 ![[Alva - Alva on Liquid Emotions _2 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Found a right strange little jar. You know it?
 ![[Alva - Alva on Liquid Emotions _2 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: How is this possible? It's a jar of... undisciplined, but concentrated emotions.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Liquid Emotions _2 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Distilling emotions is rather insane, even for me. Do you know anything about this?
 ![[Alva - Alva on Liquid Emotions _2 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: The Maraketh evoke emotions with tales, but someone tried to do it much more... directly. What sorcery is this?
 ![[Alva - Alva on Liquid Emotions _2 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: This jar of liquid disturbs me.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Liquid Emotions _2 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: This jar. Makes me... feel things. I don't like feeling things.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Liquid Emotions _2 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Alva: Hmm... we once excavated a ruin where the engraved pictures told a peculiar story. It appeared as if they were teaching their children new knowledge by imbuing emotions in a piece of jewelry. It was a very old ruin, but... maybe the distilled energy you found is a remnant of that lost culture. If you find a few more, you might be able to instill knowledge in something yourself...

## Alva on Simulacrum Splinters /2
Ranger: This unnatural splinter I found - it's got markings. Any ideas?

Huntress: Had quite the vision, but it weren't from the Spirit. Summat to do with this Splinter?

Monk: Does your expertise tell you anything about this strange grey splinter?

Witch: Tell me, darling, what you make of this bewitching splinter.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Simulacrum Splinters _2 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: The Azmeri deceiver... one of his assaults left something behind. What do you make of it?
 ![[Alva - Alva on Simulacrum Splinters _2 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: The Black Crow tried to deceive me. My attack chipped off this strange splinter from his... manifestations.
 ![[Alva - Alva on Simulacrum Splinters _2 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Got a real doozy of a remnant here. Can you take a look?
 ![[Alva - Alva on Simulacrum Splinters _2 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Alva: Let me see... this marking... we've come across it in our excavations. In context, it was treated as something quite negative, something Karui myths referred to as 'sealed away,' or 'imprisoned.' If this is related to that entity you released near Kedge Bay... whatever it is, it's now fixated on you. You should try to gather more of these splinters. With enough of them, perhaps we can decipher the story of these markings. As a treasure hunter, I know: the past holds all the answers, if you're willing to look hard enough.

## Alva on Fortress /3
Alva: At first it seemed there was nothing in the historical record about that strange pillar of flame you found... But then it occurred to me... a great deal has been written about times of ash. Fires that scorched the land, clouds that blotted out the sun, the Winter of the World...
