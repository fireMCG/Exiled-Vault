## Kanu on Aurora May /3
Kanu: The Karui have no ships like the Aurora May. Our vessels are meant to travel between islands or to fish. But the Aurora May... phwoar... She feels like she could take us to the end of the world.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Aurora May _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Kanu - Kanu on Aurora May _3 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Kanu - Kanu on Aurora May _3 - L1 - A3.ogg]]

Warrior: She might have to.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Aurora May _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Careful, you'll jinx it.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Aurora May _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: The ships remind me of the carts back home. Always in motion. A masterful construction.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Aurora May _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: I'll take your word on that. Give me steady earth any day.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Aurora May _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: It's a wonder. The Azmeri got nothin' like it.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Aurora May _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: You speak more truly than you know.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Aurora May _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Better than the one I took out of Trarthus. Ripe old flotsam, that was.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Aurora May _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Kanu: I'm just happy to live in times like these. I think about it sometimes, you know. What a day to be alive, to breathe in the air, feel the sun. Could be a lot worse.

## Kanu on The Weapon /7
Kanu: So what is this... {thing...} you've found? Seems only fair to ask, since we're doing all the hard work sailing you around.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _7 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _7 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

Warrior: It is one piece of an ancient Weapon. It may allow us to slay the Beast and put an end to Corruption.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _7 - L2 - A1.ogg]] ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _7 - L2 - A2.ogg]]

Witch: Don't you worry your pretty little head about that.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _7 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: They tell me it's a piece of an ancient Weapon. But... we shall see.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _7 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: It's a piece of an ancient weapon. But I'll keep the rest to myself, thank you very much.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _7 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: It's part of some Weapon, though I don't see how it all works yet.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _7 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: This is a piece of a Weapon. A grand creation of unknown power.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _7 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Just another ancient thing I had to 'acquire.' All I do these days, really.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _7 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Kanu: Slay the who and end what?
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _7 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Kanu: She called me pretty! D'you guys hear that?
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _7 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Kanu: Alright, alright! Each to their own!
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _7 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: It could save the world.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _7 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: {Not...} what I {meant!}
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _7 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Kanu: Oh. How interesting... I guess. So we're riskin' our necks for some old collector's item, eh?
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _7 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: It's more than that. It could be our only way to fight back.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _7 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: It is more than just some collector's item. It could be what helps us save the world.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _7 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Oh no... It's much more than that. Could be what helps us save the world.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _7 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: We do as we must. It could be our salvation.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _7 - L18 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Pretty much. But... could be what helps us save the world. Or somethin'.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _7 - L19 - A1.ogg]]

Kanu: Could be? So... it's uncertain? Ah well, either way, we're doing our part. Let's see what happens!

## Kanu on Introduction /8
Kanu: Watch your step, eh! Slip overboard and you're on your own. I'm Kanu. First Mate of the Aurora May.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Introduction _8 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Kanu - Kanu on Introduction _8 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

Kanu: If you're lookin' for a ship, best speak to the boss, Makoru. And mind your manners while you're at it!
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Introduction _8 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Kanu: If you're after a ship and crew, you'll need a charter. We don't just work for anyone who shuffles aboard off the dock, you know! Speak to Rog about the charter. Yeah, he can sort you out.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Introduction _8 - L3 - A1.ogg]] ![[Kanu - Kanu on Introduction _8 - L3 - A2.ogg]] ![[Kanu - Kanu on Introduction _8 - L3 - A3.ogg]]

Warrior: Well, quite the introduction. Good to meet you, Kanu.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Introduction _8 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Young Kanu. Confidence... or arrogance? Which is it? We may get along, depending on which you choose.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Introduction _8 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Good day, Kanu. You have such confidence. I hope you are a capable seafarer.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Introduction _8 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: You're a boisterous one. But your smile seems... kind.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Introduction _8 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Well, Kanu... quite the mouth you've got.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Introduction _8 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Please. No need for all the theatrics.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Introduction _8 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Alright, mate. Not looking for trouble, just a crew.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Introduction _8 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Kanu: Phwoar. Your voice is thick as a rock! Powerful. I won't mess around with you after a few drinks, eh?
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Introduction _8 - L11 - A1.ogg]] ![[Kanu - Kanu on Introduction _8 - L11 - A2.ogg]]

Kanu: Let's wait and see. I have a way of growing on people, or so I'm told.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Introduction _8 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Kanu: My nana always said, a smile speaks a thousand words. Pleased to meet you, my lady.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Introduction _8 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Kanu: It's gotten me in my fair share of trouble. And out of it, too.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Introduction _8 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Kanu: Hey, come on. Life is for livin'. Live loud - and die quietly, that's what I say.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Introduction _8 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Kanu: Well, this crew does a good job of getting into trouble. So... guess you found both! I'm just having some fun. Welcome aboard.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Introduction _8 - L16 - A1.ogg]] ![[Kanu - Kanu on Introduction _8 - L16 - A2.ogg]]

Kanu: Yeah, that's right. I'm the best!
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Introduction _8 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Oh, I can imagine. One after me own heart.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Introduction _8 - L18 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Hmm. Not a bad mantra, I will admit.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Introduction _8 - L19 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: The best?
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Introduction _8 - L20 - A1.ogg]]

Kanu: Uhh... the second best!
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Introduction _8 - L21 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Hah! Well done.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Introduction _8 - L22 - A1.ogg]]


## Kanu on Makoru /5
Warrior: The boss? You mean Makoru?
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Makoru _5 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: The boss? Address her by her name, why don't you? Insolent boy.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Makoru _5 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: By the boss you mean... Makoru?
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Makoru _5 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: I assume by the boss you mean Makoru?
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Makoru _5 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Makoru is the boss, right? Stupid question really.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Makoru _5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Makoru is the boss. I get it.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Makoru _5 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Makoru seems like a fitting boss.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Makoru _5 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Kanu: That's right! Makoru's the boss! But more than that... she's a role model. A true leader. She showed the Kalguurans what the Karui have to offer. And honestly, I'm just lucky to be following in her footsteps.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Makoru _5 - L8 - A1.ogg]] ![[Kanu - Kanu on Makoru _5 - L8 - A2.ogg]]

Makoru: Alright, alright. You know flattery doesn't work on me, Kanu.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Makoru _5 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Kanu: It is simply the truth!
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Makoru _5 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: Keeping an entire crew sober and on their toes is no small feat.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Makoru _5 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: I admire Makoru, yes. You, not so much.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Makoru _5 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: You have done well, Makoru. There is no denying that.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Makoru _5 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: I respect you, Makoru. You lead with precision and knowledge. Not bluster.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Makoru _5 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Aye. You're an impressive leader, Makoru.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Makoru _5 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: A true leader delivers more than just orders. You lead by a fine example, Makoru.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Makoru _5 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: I can tell she knows what she's doing. Can see the crew's respect for her.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Makoru _5 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

## Kanu on The Weapon /7
: So... found more of that fancy Weapon, eh? Can I see it?
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _7 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: We cannot touch it. The Hooded One keeps the pieces safe.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _7 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: No. You cannot.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _7 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: The Hooded One has it concealed... I dare not ask where. It cannot be safely touched by mortal hands.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _7 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: I don't think so.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _7 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Would show ya if I could. But they're full of {rathin}.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _7 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: That would not be a good idea.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _7 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Yeah, why not? I'll bring it around at some point. I just don't have it on me.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _7 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Kanu: Oh... okay. Well, the more I hear, the more curious I get. Can't really blame me, I'm a simple fella. Something like this... entire generations come and go without having eyes on a thing so significant!
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _7 - L9 - A1.ogg]] ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _7 - L9 - A2.ogg]]

Warrior: So {now} you take it seriously?
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _7 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: So now you are interested in its power. Curious.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _7 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: It is something to be taken seriously. Whether it works, remains to be seen.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _7 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Why take it so seriously all of a sudden?
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _7 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: So... you're taking note of it now. Fair enough.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _7 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: I see that you take it more seriously now.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _7 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Oh look, someone's taking it all a bit more serious!
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _7 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Kanu: The crew talks. I listen. Some of them heard that Doryabi guy arguing with the spooky one in the cape. It did sound all very serious.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _7 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: That'd be Doryani and the Hooded One.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _7 - L18 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Doryani. And the Hooded One. Fool.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _7 - L19 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: You mean Doryani and the Hooded One.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _7 - L20 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: I think you mean Doryani and the Hooded One.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _7 - L21 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Oh, Doryani and... the Hooded One?
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _7 - L22 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Their titles are Doryani and... the Hooded One.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _7 - L23 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: You mean Doryani and... oh well, whatever. Close enough.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _7 - L24 - A1.ogg]]

Kanu: Yeah. Those fellas. Ah well. Good luck findin' the other piece. We got your back!

## Kanu on The Way /5
Kanu: When the Kalguurans showed up, it brought a lot of tension to the tribes. Also brought doubt among the outer islands. My family left the Tasalio tribe when I was only a boy. They then joined the Tukohama tribe. My parents found hope in their message of strength.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Way _5 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Way _5 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Way _5 - L1 - A3.ogg]]

Warrior: Did {you}?
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Way _5 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: You sound skeptical.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Way _5 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: As they should. Did you feel the same?
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Way _5 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: I suppose when you have children, you can't afford to go it alone.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Way _5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: And I 'spose... you didn't?
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Way _5 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: I can understand that. But did you find hope in that message?
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Way _5 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Gotta give it to 'im, he's consistent.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Way _5 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Kanu: Well, look... I don't reject the Way. It just feels different to me. Late at night, out on the sea... I can still feel what our old tribe called 'the Flow.' It's real. It's powerful.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Way _5 - L9 - A1.ogg]] ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Way _5 - L9 - A2.ogg]]

Warrior: The Flow? Is that similar to the Way?
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Way _5 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: I've always felt a flow of energy underneath the world. Is it... like that?
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Way _5 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: The sea has a power?
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Way _5 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: And what makes your 'Flow' different from the Way?
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Way _5 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: What is it, this 'Flow'?
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Way _5 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Tell me more of this 'Flow.'
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Way _5 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Whatchu mean?
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Way _5 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Kanu: Oh... it's hard to put into words... All I know is, Tavakai's version of 'The Way' is definitely not something I can flow with. Tavakai doesn't trust outsiders. He wants to drive the Karui further away into isolation. And that doesn't feel right to me. Feels backwards. We should at least hear new ideas out. See what they can offer us.

## Kanu on The Way /5
Kanu: When the Kalguurans showed up, it brought a lot of tension to the tribes. Also brought doubt among the outer islands. My family left the Tasalio tribe when I was only a boy. They then joined the Tukohama tribe. My parents found hope in their message of strength.

Warrior: Did {you}?
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Way _5 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: You sound skeptical.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Way _5 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: As they should. Did you feel the same?
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Way _5 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: I suppose when you have children, you can't afford to go it alone.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Way _5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: And I 'spose... you didn't?
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Way _5 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: I can understand that. But did you find hope in that message?
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Way _5 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Gotta give it to 'im, he's consistent.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Way _5 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Kanu: Well, look... I don't reject the Way. It just feels different to me. Late at night, out on the sea... I can still feel what our old tribe called 'the Flow.' It's real. It's powerful.

## Kanu on The Weapon /5
Kanu: You found all the pieces, then? So... what now? Do they just sort of... snap together?
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _5 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: If only it were that simple...
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _5 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Yes, the ancient Weapon spread in pieces across the sea for thousands of years just {snaps together.}
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _5 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: We're not sure yet... the Hooded One and Doryani are deliberating. Or arguing. Depends on their mood, it seems.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _5 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Somehow, I don't think we'll be that lucky.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Got no idea. Your guess is as good as mine. But it probably won't be {that} easy.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _5 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: It's just another step in the puzzle of history. But this... is no easy puzzle.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _5 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: I'll suggest they try that. Chances are it's a bit more complicated. Always is.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _5 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Kanu: Sheesh! What's your problem?
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _5 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: You ask too many questions.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on The Weapon _5 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Kanu: Hmm. Yeah, guess you're right. Nothing's that easy, is it? Let me ask around, eh? Maybe somebody's heard a rumour, or a myth. You never know.

## Kanu on Tasalio Tribe /3
Kanu: My family wasn't always from these parts, you know. We came out here a few generations ago. I was always out exploring the waters and fishing, even as a young boy. That's just in my blood. My family's tribe... the Tasalio tribe... they value being on the water above all, but the young ones were never allowed to go very far. I used to drive my parents nuts. I looked out across the water... and oh boy, I wanted to keep going. But I never went too far. I couldn't leave my family behind. Where {they} are... {that's} my home.

Warrior: Home is wherever you can find those you care about.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Tasalio Tribe _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: It's just an illusion, this 'home' people keep talking about.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Tasalio Tribe _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Sometimes we do not value home until it is gone. I thought I didn't need my home, but, in truth, it is difficult to be without it.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Tasalio Tribe _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Home is wherever you find yourself.

Huntress: Some of us don't have a choice.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Tasalio Tribe _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: I understand. Home is where we ground ourselves.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Tasalio Tribe _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: I ain't ever had a home. Just places to sleep where I probably won't get stabbed.
 ![[Kanu - Kanu on Tasalio Tribe _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Kanu: Well hey... here I am. And I'm thankful the boss showed me that I can make a new life for myself, one that I choose.
