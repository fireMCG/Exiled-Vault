## Kaimana on Shark Fin /3
Warrior: I will do what I can.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Fine. If I see a shark, I'll kill it.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: If it means so much to your people, I will track down this... shark... whatever it is.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: It'll be a shame to cull such a creature, but perhaps it must be done.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: The hunt is on.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: I will do what must be done.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Yeah, alright.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Kaimana: Hatuko... ma koro, hmm? When you're ready, please, be on your way, yes?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Kaimana: It is probably best that you're gone before Tavakai gets back...
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin _3 - L9 - A1.ogg]]


## Kaimana on Blood Fever /5
Kaimana: Yes... it plagues us more and more of late. Starts with a fever. Progresses to boils rising from under the skin... hmm? Then... madness! Rage.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Blood Fever _5 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Blood Fever _5 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

Matiki: It is heart breaking. Watching so many loved ones ripped apart. Sent away to die alone.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Blood Fever _5 - L2 - A1.ogg]] ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Blood Fever _5 - L2 - A2.ogg]]

Warrior: Why are they sent away?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Blood Fever _5 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: That seems cruel, even to me.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Blood Fever _5 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Such things must be done for the greater good.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Blood Fever _5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Many animals crawl off to die alone. I never thought people might.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Blood Fever _5 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Why would ya do that?!
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Blood Fever _5 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: You send them away? Why?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Blood Fever _5 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Some Trarthans do that, too. Dying with dignity and all that.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Blood Fever _5 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Kaimana: We have no choice. Let one stay, their family falls. Let the family stay... well... no more tribe, yes...
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Blood Fever _5 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: The Blood Fever must end. No matter what it takes.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Blood Fever _5 - L11 - A1.ogg]]


## Kaimana on Pride of the Tukohama /5
Kaimana: Oh, you made us all proud, yes! You will forever hold a special place in the hearts of the Tukohama tribe.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Pride of the Tukohama _5 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Yes - you will be long remembered. The outsider... who saved us all. We won't forget.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Pride of the Tukohama _5 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Yes - you will be long remembered. The lost son who saved us all. We won't forget.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Pride of the Tukohama _5 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: I will remember you both in kind.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Pride of the Tukohama _5 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: I {suppose...} you two have irritated me less than most.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Pride of the Tukohama _5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I will remember your tales.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Pride of the Tukohama _5 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: I won't, either.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Pride of the Tukohama _5 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: You have me thanks, and my fondness.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Pride of the Tukohama _5 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: We will each take lessons from this. I will remember you, as well.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Pride of the Tukohama _5 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Been wild, seeing people livin' happily without money, slaves, or drugs. I won't soon forget it.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Pride of the Tukohama _5 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Kaimana: Well, of course. We're pretty special, yes?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Pride of the Tukohama _5 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Unforgettable! Ha!
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Pride of the Tukohama _5 - L12 - A1.ogg]]


## Kaimana on Hinekora /5
Kaimana: Hinekora {spoke to you?} What did she say?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Hinekora _5 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: She did {what?}
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Hinekora _5 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: I'm not sure what she meant... I'll have to think on it.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Hinekora _5 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: It was nothing... it meant nothing.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Hinekora _5 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: It is hard to say.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Hinekora _5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Nothing I didn't already know.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Hinekora _5 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Perhaps it's a way for me to fix what's broken.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Hinekora _5 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Something I won't soon forget.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Hinekora _5 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: It was strange. Very strange.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Hinekora _5 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Kaimana: Ah, the Mother of Death tells us not what we want to know, but what we need to hear, yes! The meaning of her prophecies will become clear... when the time is right.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Hinekora _5 - L10 - A1.ogg]] ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Hinekora _5 - L10 - A2.ogg]]

Tavakai: The Hinekora tribe seems to have endless time to sit around playing with cryptic messages. We do not. We live in the real world, where we must fight or die. In any case... I don't want to know how you came to speak with the Mother of Death.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Hinekora _5 - L11 - A1.ogg]] ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Hinekora _5 - L11 - A2.ogg]] ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Hinekora _5 - L11 - A3.ogg]]


## Kaimana on Tavakai /4
Warrior: Kaimana! How did you survive?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Tavakai _4 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: You're still sane? Don't tell me your {herbs and minerals} actually worked.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Tavakai _4 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: You're not sick! What's happening?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Tavakai _4 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: You're still healthy! How?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Tavakai _4 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: You didn't catch the Fever?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Tavakai _4 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Kaimana... you're sane. Are you alright?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Tavakai _4 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: You don't seem sick. What's goin' on?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Tavakai _4 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Kaimana: Yes! But for how long, I can't be certain. Now... please. Stop Tavakai. He is lost!
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Tavakai _4 - L8 - A1.ogg]] ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Tavakai _4 - L8 - A2.ogg]]

Warrior: I will do what I must. Find somewhere safe. Hide.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Tavakai _4 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Oh, I plan to take care of {him.} Try not to die in the meantime.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Tavakai _4 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I will put an end to this. Hide until I return!
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Tavakai _4 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: I will stop him. You stay safe. Hide.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Tavakai _4 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: I'm on the hunt. Find somewhere safe.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Tavakai _4 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Yes. I will stop him. Run and hide until this is over.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Tavakai _4 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: That's the plan, miss. You just keep yourself alive.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Tavakai _4 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Kaimana: I will, yes. Go. Save our people.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Tavakai _4 - L16 - A1.ogg]]


## Kaimana on Shark Fin Found /1
Kaimana: Ah! You have a fin from the great shark! Yes! Well done! I will get to work at once. Let us see what comes of it. The ancestors smile upon you this day, yes! Ooo haha!
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin Found _1 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin Found _1 - L1 - A2.ogg]]


## Kaimana on Introduction /3
Kaimana: I am Kaimana, yes! You are welcome here, but... no further! Beyond remains a sacred place to our people. By our Way, to pass through, a newcomer must sing our tribe's song of greeting, yes! And... I am quite sure that you do not know it.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Introduction _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Introduction _3 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Introduction _3 - L1 - A3.ogg]]

Warrior: I know a song or two... but not that one.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Introduction _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: A song? I could sing. I... I just don't want to.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Introduction _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Yes, tale-woman. It is true. I do not know your song.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Introduction _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Indeed. I am not much of a singer.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Introduction _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Fine. I'll just be on my way then.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Introduction _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: I know many songs. But sadly, not yours.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Introduction _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: I can hold a tune or two, after a few drinks at least...
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Introduction _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Kaimana: Ahahaha! I'm sure.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Introduction _3 - L9 - A1.ogg]]


## Kaimana on Shark Fin Found /2
Kaimana: Many blessings. Thank you. Now... I must see what I can do with it.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin Found _2 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Kaimana: Though you have done me a great deed... perhaps don't stay {too} long. Tavakai can get a bit upset with unexpected guests... hmmm?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin Found _2 - L2 - A1.ogg]] ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin Found _2 - L2 - A2.ogg]]


## Kaimana on Shark Fin Found /5
Kaimana: Wait... what do you have there? Is that... a fin? From Whakapanu Island?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin Found _5 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin Found _5 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

Warrior: You recognise it? Could it be useful?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin Found _5 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Um... yes?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin Found _5 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: It is. Does it hold a hidden use?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin Found _5 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Yes, that's where I found it.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin Found _5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: It is. What of it?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin Found _5 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Yes, it is. Do you need it?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin Found _5 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Uh, I think so. Is it important?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin Found _5 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Kaimana: Blazing {Valako!} I don't believe it. I was seeking {something} from that beast for my next elixir. I am experimenting day in... day out... yes? Trying to find a cure...
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin Found _5 - L9 - A1.ogg]] ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin Found _5 - L9 - A2.ogg]]

Warrior: A cure?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin Found _5 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: A cure? Of course... for what?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin Found _5 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: A cure? For what sickness?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin Found _5 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: A cure? For what ailment?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin Found _5 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: What kind of cure?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin Found _5 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: A cure? For what?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin Found _5 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Someone got a sickness?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin Found _5 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Kaimana: Why... the blood fever, of course! It has been the death of many of our people of late... I am under Tavakai's order... to cure it! Quite the task, hmmm? Please, let me have it. I have something for you in return!
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin Found _5 - L17 - A1.ogg]] ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin Found _5 - L17 - A2.ogg]] ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin Found _5 - L17 - A3.ogg]]


## Kaimana on Kitava /4
Kaimana: Why do you speak of Kitava here? It was {our} Tukohama that gave him his scars!
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Kitava _4 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Those cultists that massacred Oriath were no {Ngakuramakoi.} They were... undesirables.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Kitava _4 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: You hold no connection to them?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Kitava _4 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: How convenient for you.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Kitava _4 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Ah, much like the Faridun.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Kitava _4 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: I don't understand the distinction.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Kitava _4 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: They were cast out? Or driven away?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Kitava _4 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Are we not all beholden to each other?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Kitava _4 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: So that's why you never tried to free them.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Kitava _4 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: The cult of Kitava grew like a tumour, when we allowed our culture to weaken. Kitava would have consumed the world. Had I been of age, I would have slain him myself. Let them all rot, forgotten.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Kitava _4 - L10 - A1.ogg]] ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Kitava _4 - L10 - A2.ogg]] ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Kitava _4 - L10 - A3.ogg]]


## Kaimana on Knowing your Place /4
Warrior: What {is} your place?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Knowing your Place _4 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: And what {is} your place?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Knowing your Place _4 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Are you a tale-woman?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Knowing your Place _4 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: What is your role here?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Knowing your Place _4 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: What's your place in your tribe?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Knowing your Place _4 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: What is it that {you} do here?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Knowing your Place _4 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: If I might ask, what is your place here?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Knowing your Place _4 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Kaimana: Well... I'm a mystic. A mother. A doctor. A protector. A follower... yes? It is my duty to remedy the Blood Fever that increasingly plagues our people. I have not found a cure... not yet, at least. I continue to search for the right herbs, minerals and... organic matter.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Knowing your Place _4 - L8 - A1.ogg]] ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Knowing your Place _4 - L8 - A2.ogg]] ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Knowing your Place _4 - L8 - A3.ogg]] ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Knowing your Place _4 - L8 - A4.ogg]]

Warrior: Can herbs and minerals really cure Blood Fever?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Knowing your Place _4 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Organic matter? You should be delving into the dark arts instead.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Knowing your Place _4 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Do herbs and minerals truly hold such power?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Knowing your Place _4 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: I've seen many gifts from nature, but a cure for Blood Fever?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Knowing your Place _4 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Do these islands have summat like that?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Knowing your Place _4 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Would that... work?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Knowing your Place _4 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Well, good luck with that.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Knowing your Place _4 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Kaimana: Ahhh! Don't underestimate the remedies the world provides us! Everything, alive or not, holds a secret. Some underlying truth, yes. We must keep trying new things. The truth will reveal itself in the patterns we see!
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Knowing your Place _4 - L16 - A1.ogg]] ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Knowing your Place _4 - L16 - A2.ogg]] ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Knowing your Place _4 - L16 - A3.ogg]]


## Kaimana on Learning /3
Kaimana: We learn all the time. With every tide and every moon, yes? I would invite you to join us. To eat with us. To learn your story. To see beyond your eyes, yes? Talk and... share. But it is not up to me.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Learning _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Learning _3 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Learning _3 - L1 - A3.ogg]]

Warrior: I was hoping to meet some of my people. May I enter?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Learning _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: I think I'd pass on that, regardless. I'm not a... people person.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Learning _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I would never ask you to betray your traditions.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Learning _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Fine. I didn't want to go in there anyway.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Learning _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: You can't let me in?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Learning _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: I understand. Now is not the time.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Learning _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Oh come on, maybe just a quick little visit?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Learning _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Kaimana: I am... a simple medicine woman. I know my place, yes!
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Learning _3 - L9 - A1.ogg]]


## Kaimana on Ngamakanui /5
Kaimana: Ah. Ngamakanui is all around us. The waters. The Way. The Karui. Ngakanu is our home. But Ngamakanui is our heart, yes?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Ngamakanui _5 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: So Ngamakanui is not... a place?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Ngamakanui _5 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: I have no idea what any of that means. Where is Ngamakanui?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Ngamakanui _5 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Makes me think of the Vastiri.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Ngamakanui _5 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: I think I understand.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Ngamakanui _5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Sounds like you've a touch of the Spirit, yourself.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Ngamakanui _5 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: I feel something like this as well, in my own way.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Ngamakanui _5 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Uhh... what?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Ngamakanui _5 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: We are nomadic... usually. We've tarried too long in this place. Ngamakanui is wherever the {Ngakuramakoi} currently call home.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Ngamakanui _5 - L9 - A1.ogg]] ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Ngamakanui _5 - L9 - A2.ogg]]

Tavakai: We guard and protect the land, and it provides for us in return. We defend it with blood and axe. We cull that which should not be; that which Corrupts. Then, we travel on. Eventually, another tribe will arrive, finding it unspoiled. We do this so that when we move on, we too will find bounty waiting for us.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Ngamakanui _5 - L10 - A1.ogg]] ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Ngamakanui _5 - L10 - A2.ogg]] ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Ngamakanui _5 - L10 - A3.ogg]] ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Ngamakanui _5 - L10 - A4.ogg]]

Kaimana: Yes! That is a beautiful aspect of the Way. Seen like this, the tribes are one! Mmm.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Ngamakanui _5 - L11 - A1.ogg]]


## Kaimana on Shark Fin /4
Kaimana: Though... perhaps you could be of some use, yes?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin _4 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Kaimana: Hmmm... I wonder if you could do something for me, yes?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin _4 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Kaimana: I am working on a new elixir... another experiment, another concoction, hah! But I'm looking for an ingredient. Though it requires a little... bravery, to fetch. Travel to Whakapanu Island. Seek a great shark. Then... see what you can... acquire... and bring it back here! Then I'll see what I can do with it!
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin _4 - L3 - A1.ogg]] ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin _4 - L3 - A2.ogg]] ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin _4 - L3 - A3.ogg]] ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin _4 - L3 - A4.ogg]]

Warrior: What do you need it for?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin _4 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: And why in the world would I do that?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin _4 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I have never heard of such a creature. What purpose does this serve?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin _4 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: What use is a shark?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin _4 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: I don't mind a hunt, but what's the catch?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin _4 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Why must I seek a shark?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin _4 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: That's a new one. Never fought a shark before. What's, uh, the mission?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin _4 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Kaimana: The Blood Fever... Tavakai insists we bring it to an end, yes. And that is my critical task. It is said... the great shark of Whakapanu Island contains unique blood. I must at least try!
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin _4 - L11 - A1.ogg]] ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Shark Fin _4 - L11 - A2.ogg]]


## Kaimana on Tavakai /3
Kaimana: Tukohama heard him... heard him beg for guidance, yes! And then... Tukohama {saw} him. And showed him 'The Way'. We've not known such a thing since the time of Akoya! So... who am I to question our leader?
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Tavakai _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Tavakai _3 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Tavakai _3 - L1 - A3.ogg]]

Warrior: Leadership should be determined by the character of a man's decisions.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Tavakai _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: I heard Tukohama was dead. This sounds wrong to me.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Tavakai _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: The most capable should be in charge. It is their duty, and their right.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Tavakai _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: I've never gotten on with authority. I only do what I feel is right.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Tavakai _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: So long as he's making things right. That's what it takes.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Tavakai _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Questions lead to doubt. Doubt can be lethal. He must do what he thinks is right.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Tavakai _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: I just do what I'm told, 'til the next guy's in charge. I don't do... morality.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Tavakai _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Kaimana: Right and wrong and all that's in between, yes? Hard to know. Hard to find. Hard to... learn.
 ![[Kaimana - Kaimana on Tavakai _3 - L9 - A1.ogg]]
