## Mortimer on Cracks in the Earth /3
Mortimer: So, you did it. Within the lair of that Devourer was more to this story! How did you defeat them?
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Cracks in the Earth _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: They were the prey. I, the hunter.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Cracks in the Earth _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: These ones seemed weak. Like scouts. More may follow.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Cracks in the Earth _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Carefully and methodically.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Cracks in the Earth _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: I feel like that should be obvious.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Cracks in the Earth _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Simple. My power was greater than theirs.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Cracks in the Earth _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: With a blow they won't soon forget.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Cracks in the Earth _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: No need to get into gory details.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Cracks in the Earth _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Mortimer: I see. Well, it is my duty to defend our kin from these monsters, and I will do my best - but do keep collapsing in their entry points. I'm not quite the shot I used to be. You have my thanks.

## Mortimer on Lurking Creatures /4
Mortimer: Well... I don't know how else to describe them. They rip right up out of the dirt, fearsome and terrifying! I've never seen anything like it!
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Lurking Creatures _4 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Neither have I. What do they look like?
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Lurking Creatures _4 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Hmm... tell me more.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Lurking Creatures _4 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: There is some mentions of this in the teachings. Tell me more.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Lurking Creatures _4 - L4 - A1.ogg]] ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Lurking Creatures _4 - L4 - A2.ogg]]

Witch: Ooh, what do they look like?
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Lurking Creatures _4 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: This bodes ill. Tell me of their appearance.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Lurking Creatures _4 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: What do they look like?
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Lurking Creatures _4 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Sounds like trouble. What am I lookin' for here?
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Lurking Creatures _4 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Mortimer: Black-blooded. Green-eyed. Darkness oozes about them wherever they skulk. They reek of a time long buried. Well... just speculation, of course!
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Lurking Creatures _4 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Long ago, followers of the Dreamer joined the Third Pact... Rallying against an ancient enemy with black blood and eyes of green. If they have returned... Perhaps I am meant to resist them.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Lurking Creatures _4 - L10 - A1.ogg]] ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Lurking Creatures _4 - L10 - A2.ogg]] ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Lurking Creatures _4 - L10 - A3.ogg]]

Sorceress: Could it be? Hmm... perhaps the old enemy has returned. We Maraketh fought a war against them in ancient times. If it is them... I will destroy them all! I will drive them back into the darkness from whence they came!
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Lurking Creatures _4 - L11 - A1.ogg]] ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Lurking Creatures _4 - L11 - A2.ogg]] ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Lurking Creatures _4 - L11 - A3.ogg]] ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Lurking Creatures _4 - L11 - A4.ogg]]


## Mortimer on Lurking Creatures /1
Mortimer: I am curious to learn more about these creatures... do let me know what you discover.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Lurking Creatures _1 - L1 - A1.ogg]]


## Mortimer on Lurking Creatures /3
Mortimer: You've seen them? Ah ha! Then my eyes do not deceive.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Lurking Creatures _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: They are not products of nature. Someone {made them}.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Lurking Creatures _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: The Spirit dwells in most creatures, living or dead... Yet it's absent from {them}.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Lurking Creatures _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]] ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Lurking Creatures _3 - L3 - A2.ogg]]

Monk: They are indeed the enemy that the Third Pact fought against in ancient times.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Lurking Creatures _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: You didn't tell me how adorable they are. Totally uncontrollable, though.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Lurking Creatures _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Yes. I am now certain they are the same ancient enemy we Maraketh fought so long ago. I must tell you, this... is very concerning.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Lurking Creatures _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]] ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Lurking Creatures _3 - L6 - A2.ogg]]

Warrior: Yes. Creatures of vile darkness.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Lurking Creatures _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Yeah, right bloody nightmares, they were.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Lurking Creatures _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Mortimer: We have to hold them back. Perhaps if we can keep them below ground... they may return to where they came from. Though... I wouldn't hold my breath.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Lurking Creatures _3 - L9 - A1.ogg]]


## Mortimer on Iron Count /2
Mortimer: You have done us a great deed here, friend. Do not hesitate to ask me for assistance. Old Mortimer is still the Steward, for what it's worth. If I can aid you, I shall.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Iron Count _2 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: I appreciate that, Mortimer.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Iron Count _2 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: I'll aid ye as well if ye need it, if I can.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Iron Count _2 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: May your path be ever clear.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Iron Count _2 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: I'm more interested in your dog.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Iron Count _2 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: You honour me with your promise.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Iron Count _2 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: I will take you up on that.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Iron Count _2 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Yeah I could probably do with a lift at some point...
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Iron Count _2 - L8 - A1.ogg]]


## Mortimer on Cracks in the Earth /2
Ranger: I'll look into it, Mortimer.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Cracks in the Earth _2 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Aye, I'll check out them cracks.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Cracks in the Earth _2 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: As you wish.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Cracks in the Earth _2 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Alright, alright. Fine.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Cracks in the Earth _2 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Fear not, old one.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Cracks in the Earth _2 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: I'll see what I can do for Clearfell.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Cracks in the Earth _2 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Alright. I'll mess 'em up for ya.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Cracks in the Earth _2 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mortimer: I knew I could count on you!
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Cracks in the Earth _2 - L8 - A1.ogg]]


## Mortimer on Cracks in the Earth /5
Mortimer: Out there... ancient creatures... lurking beneath the surface... cloaked in darkness... They then burst forth to feast on the souls of the recently departed! Trust me. I've seen them! The others think me mad, but mark my words... it is true.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Cracks in the Earth _5 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Cracks in the Earth _5 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

Ranger: That sounds like you've seen the Mud Burrower.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Cracks in the Earth _5 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: And these things aren't the Devourer? You're sure?
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Cracks in the Earth _5 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Ancient creatures from beneath the surface... you don't mean the 'Devourer'?
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Cracks in the Earth _5 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: It could be true.... or it could just be that 'Devourer' creature. In which case, you {are} mad.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Cracks in the Earth _5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Are you sure it's not just the 'Devourer' that's tormenting the Encampment?
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Cracks in the Earth _5 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: Are you sure it isn't the Devourer?
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Cracks in the Earth _5 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Surely you mean the Devourer, eh?
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Cracks in the Earth _5 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Mortimer: No, no, no... but... that damned thing has likely opened their passage to the surface. These... creatures. They are something else. It is not but one threat... it is... {many}. And I fear what it means for Clearfell.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Cracks in the Earth _5 - L9 - A1.ogg]] ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Cracks in the Earth _5 - L9 - A2.ogg]]

Ranger: I won't let them destroy my forest.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Cracks in the Earth _5 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: What can I do?
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Cracks in the Earth _5 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: I see now why I was called here.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Cracks in the Earth _5 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: It's always something with this place, isn't it?
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Cracks in the Earth _5 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Perhaps I can see what can be done...
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Cracks in the Earth _5 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: We are tormented on all sides.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Cracks in the Earth _5 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: I'll add it to the list.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Cracks in the Earth _5 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Mortimer: Depose them. Cave in the cracks. Cave in whatever you find. We've got enough trouble here as it is!
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Cracks in the Earth _5 - L17 - A1.ogg]]


## Mortimer on The Mad Wolf /3
Mortimer: I'm an old timer. I've seen the Clans at war. Seen the Thanes at each other's throats. But... never one treating his own quite like this.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on The Mad Wolf _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: I don't doubt it. He's mad.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on The Mad Wolf _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: It's true, then - the Count weren't always so vicious?
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on The Mad Wolf _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: This is what Corruption brings. It must have affected the Count's mind.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on The Mad Wolf _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Power always corrupts. Not me, of course. Just the Count.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on The Mad Wolf _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: A {Sekhema} would never have done these things. The Count is mad.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on The Mad Wolf _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: The Count has betrayed us all.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on The Mad Wolf _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: That Count fella sounds like a right prick.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on The Mad Wolf _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Mortimer: Yes. Once we called him 'The Wolf' for his sense of kinship. Now... 'The Mad Wolf'. Rabid decisions. Profane thinking... and putrid results.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on The Mad Wolf _3 - L9 - A1.ogg]]


## Mortimer on Introduction /5
Mortimer: Forgive my manners, young one... I am Mortimer. I've been a steward in these parts for longer than you have drawn breath. Over the years, my canines and I have seen Ogham in turmoil and peace, and all that lay between...
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Introduction _5 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: I've seen you sometimes, though you may not have have seen me. Is this the worst it's ever been for Ogham?
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Introduction _5 - L2 - A1.ogg]] ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Introduction _5 - L2 - A2.ogg]]

Huntress: You're an Elder, then. Is this the worst you've seen?
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Introduction _5 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: And with all that you've seen, what do you make of Ogham's plight now?
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Introduction _5 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: You've got a {dog!} Can I pet him?
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Introduction _5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: You have the wisdom that only age can bring. How do you judge the current danger your people face?
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Introduction _5 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: This is a dark time for our lands.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Introduction _5 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: And how do you rate Ogham's problems now, Mort?
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Introduction _5 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Mortimer: It is in a league of its own. But we will persevere. We always do.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Introduction _5 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Mortimer: Well, yes, of course... but as I was saying, these dark times...
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Introduction _5 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: It's always a dark time in Wraeclast. Good dog! Your teeth are so menacing!
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Introduction _5 - L11 - A1.ogg]] ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Introduction _5 - L11 - A2.ogg]]

Mortimer: He is a very good dog, yes...
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Introduction _5 - L12 - A1.ogg]]


## Mortimer on Thanes /4
Ranger: Why are you alone in this?
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Thanes _4 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Where are your other tribes? Shouldn't they aid you?
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Thanes _4 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Have you no allies you can call for aid?
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Thanes _4 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Aren't your Thanes supposed to be doing something about all this?
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Thanes _4 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I know a thing or two about Ezomyr. Where are your Thanes? It is their duty to aid you, is it not?
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Thanes _4 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: Why have the Thanes not come to aid us?
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Thanes _4 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Seems like you need to bring in your allies.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Thanes _4 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mortimer: One of the first things Count Geonor did in his madness was damage our relationship with the Thanes. Insulted them and cut off contact, paranoid that they were plotting against him.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Thanes _4 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: The ties that bind are precious.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Thanes _4 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: That's terrible. He's isolated you.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Thanes _4 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Such is the way of madness.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Thanes _4 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Gotta hand it to him. That's a great strategy.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Thanes _4 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Of course. A tale as old as time.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Thanes _4 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: The bonds of our people have been savagely wounded.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Thanes _4 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: He'd have fit right in back home.
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Thanes _4 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Mortimer: Those relationships were vital! Built on the very blood and bones of those who fought for Ezomyr. It is nothing but a spit in the face of those who died for these lands!
 ![[Mortimer - Mortimer on Thanes _4 - L16 - A1.ogg]]
