## Makoru on The Captain's Challenge /5
Makoru: I became a captain against the wishes of the Trade Guild Council. To lead a Kalguuran ship, you must pass a test. I was given a makeshift crew and tasked with sailing a course in a certain amount of time. At the most dangerous point of the course, between two shallow reefs on a moonless night, our cargo of refined Verisium caught fire. It was set to explode at any moment.

Warrior: What an ordeal. How did you handle it?
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The Captain's Challenge _5 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Gripping! Go on.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The Captain's Challenge _5 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: What an adventure! Please, continue.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The Captain's Challenge _5 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Well clearly you didn't explode. What did you do?
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The Captain's Challenge _5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Oh, my... This puts me off the water even more.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The Captain's Challenge _5 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: I suppose your leadership was tested in that moment.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The Captain's Challenge _5 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Blimey. What a predicament.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The Captain's Challenge _5 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: I was faced with a choice: abandon ship, or order some of the crew into the lethal smoke to put out the fire... ... At the cost of their own lives, no less. They say it's a rather horrible death, gasping for breath with burning lungs that no longer work. So I chose to put out the fire myself. That's just how I was raised.

Warrior: Yet here you stand.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The Captain's Challenge _5 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Hmm... are you dead?
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The Captain's Challenge _5 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: But you lived?
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The Captain's Challenge _5 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: You lived to tell the tale though, it seems.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The Captain's Challenge _5 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Such bravery! How'd you survive?
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The Captain's Challenge _5 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: And yet, you live.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The Captain's Challenge _5 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Alright. I gotta know. How'd you make it out?
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The Captain's Challenge _5 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: Well luckily for me, it was all fake. It was the main part of the test. The truth of it is, the candidate passes or fails depending on the votes of the crew aboard. I earned their loyalty by my choice, and many of them still follow me to this day, here on this ship. The Council does not aid me in any way, but they also leave me to it. It's the best situation for now, until I show some true profit!

## Makoru on Career /5
Makoru: I'm a freshly-minted captain, but not new to these waters. I joined the Trade Guild as a deckhand after I ran away from home. I then worked my way up ever since. I finally took the Captain's Challenge not too long ago. and now, I'm the first Karui captain on a Kalguuran ship!
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Career _5 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Makoru - Makoru on Career _5 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Makoru - Makoru on Career _5 - L1 - A3.ogg]]

Warrior: What a story. Good for you.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Career _5 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Well, well... What a go-getter.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Career _5 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I admire you for your achievements, Makoru.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Career _5 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Well done. It can't have been easy.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Career _5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Aye, you've done well. Good on ya.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Career _5 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: So long as you are capable, it makes little difference to me.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Career _5 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Bit of an entrepreneur, eh? Go get it, I say!
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Career _5 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: Thank you, but my story has only just begun.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Career _5 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: Well! Aren't you a delight...
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Career _5 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: Now I've just got to get out there and make a name for myself. I've put a lot on the line to get to where I am. Who knows? Maybe we'll achieve great things together.

## Makoru on The Weapon /3
Makoru: Are you telling me there may be {another} Cataclysm? You should have told me sooner! If this 'Weapon' can truly save us all, we'll do whatever it takes to aid you.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The Weapon _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Makoru - Makoru on The Weapon _3 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Makoru - Makoru on The Weapon _3 - L1 - A3.ogg]]

Warrior: You're doing a fine job as it is.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The Weapon _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: As you should. But don't worry, I've got it handled.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The Weapon _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: My people, too, have sworn a pledge to fight Corruption. Welcome to the war.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The Weapon _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: You may come to regret that promise, but let's hope not.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The Weapon _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: You're doing just fine, Makoru. But I accept your vow.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The Weapon _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: It may take everything we have... and more.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The Weapon _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: It's a longshot, but it's all we've got really. Don't sweat it.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The Weapon _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: I won't fail. Maybe this is my chance to prove myself.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The Weapon _3 - L9 - A1.ogg]]


## Makoru on Tavakai /4
Makoru: In a strange way... all of this may be what ends up healing my relationship with my father. Tavakai has seen what comes of his stubborn Way... And I've seen that there is some wisdom to be found in our tribe's strength and loyalty.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Tavakai _4 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Makoru - Makoru on Tavakai _4 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Makoru - Makoru on Tavakai _4 - L1 - A3.ogg]]

Warrior: You two finding common ground is at least one good thing to come of all this.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Tavakai _4 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Well that's a relief. I thought you two might be the death of each other.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Tavakai _4 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I am pleased. Let your differences bring you together, not drive you apart!
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Tavakai _4 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: I hope for your sake, he will not let you down again.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Tavakai _4 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Don't be a stranger to your tribe. That's all I'll say on it.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Tavakai _4 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Good. You are best suited as allies.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Tavakai _4 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: All's well that ends well, I guess.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Tavakai _4 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: You're not wrong there.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Tavakai _4 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: I guess blood truly is thicker than water.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Tavakai _4 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: There'll be a lot of conversations to come, but I am hopeful.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Tavakai _4 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: Well, if there is one thing I know about my father, he learns from his mistakes.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Tavakai _4 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: I know... I won't be.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Tavakai _4 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: We are more than that. We're family.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Tavakai _4 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: We'll just have to see where it goes from here.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Tavakai _4 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: So, it seems Tavakai has pledged to aid you and... well... The crew and I already discussed it. We also volunteer! I didn't think I'd be fighting side-by-side with my father any time soon... Truly, these are the end times! Ha!

## Makoru on Introduction /5
Makoru: Welcome aboard. I'm Makoru. Captain of the Aurora May.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Introduction _5 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: Welcome back!
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Introduction _5 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: I've acquired a charter, and I'm told you're the best Captain for the job.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Introduction _5 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: So, this charter here means you have to do what I say, right?
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Introduction _5 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Good day. I have received a charter and am looking for a crew.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Introduction _5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: I've got a... paper thing... A charter.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Introduction _5 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Got a charter here.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Introduction _5 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: I have a charter. And I seek a ship and a crew.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Introduction _5 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: I've bought a charter for this ship so, guess you work for me now.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Introduction _5 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: Well... I think I might be the {only} Captain at the moment. But that is nice to hear!
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Introduction _5 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: Not exactly... but we're happy to oblige what we can.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Introduction _5 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: Look no further. The Aurora May and her crew are at your service.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Introduction _5 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: Then the hard work is done. We are at your service.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Introduction _5 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: Great! Then the Aurora May and her crew are at your service.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Introduction _5 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: Seek no further. We'll take you wherever you need to go.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Introduction _5 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: It seems that way, doesn't it?
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Introduction _5 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: We can take you wherever you need. Places other captains would never dream of going! Your business is your business. Now, we can set sail whenever you like.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Introduction _5 - L17 - A1.ogg]] ![[Makoru - Makoru on Introduction _5 - L17 - A2.ogg]]


## Makoru on Introduction /4
Makoru: Welcome aboard. I'm Makoru, Captain of the Aurora May. Yes, we are indeed looking for work, but we only operate under the Meridian Free Traders of Kingsmarch. You can't just turn up with gold and demand passage.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Introduction _4 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Makoru - Makoru on Introduction _4 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Makoru - Makoru on Introduction _4 - L1 - A3.ogg]]

Warrior: My apologies. What do I need to do?
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Introduction _4 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Are you sure? What if I had quite a lot of gold?
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Introduction _4 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I meant no offense. What is the proper custom?
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Introduction _4 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Oh... I have no idea how this kind of thing works.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Introduction _4 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Ugh. What should I do then?
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Introduction _4 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Of course. What must I do?
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Introduction _4 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: I'm sure {someone} wants this gold.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Introduction _4 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: Not to worry...
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Introduction _4 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: I don't take bribes! We have a process you must follow.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Introduction _4 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: That's fine. Let me explain.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Introduction _4 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: It's simple really.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Introduction _4 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: Just a bit of paperwork.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Introduction _4 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: It won't take a moment...
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Introduction _4 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: Oh we want it alright... but first...
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Introduction _4 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: You'll need to arrange an account and charter. Rog's your man for that. Once it's all sorted, we can talk.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Introduction _4 - L16 - A1.ogg]]


## Makoru on Kedge Bay /1
Makoru: Well... the fog is gone. But... you let out some fearsome god. Win some, lose some... I guess. I wonder what might be left over from the crashed ships there... hmm...

## Makoru on Kalguur /3
Makoru: They don't talk very much about their homeland and I'm definitely not allowed to sail there.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Kalguur _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: Are only Kalguurans permitted there?
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Kalguur _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Is it because you're not one of them?
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Kalguur _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: You are not permitted because of your lineage?
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Kalguur _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: That seems oddly cruel. For what reason?
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Kalguur _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Do you need to prove yourself first, perhaps?
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Kalguur _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Do they only allow Kalguurans?
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Kalguur _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: What? Why not? They scared of ya?
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Kalguur _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: Nah, it's nothing like that. It's just part of their culture. First, someone has to immortalise my family's triumphs into an epic poem. Then, it must be told at their royal court, before their King. This sort of custom is not too different from Karui oral traditions, but it's a tricky situation for me. I am no longer part of my tribe, so I have no family to immortalise in song. Tujen suggested that {we} could be family, but he was drunk at the time...

## Makoru on The King /5
Makoru: I don't know what to make of the Kalguuran King. I've only heard whispers. Rumours.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The King _5 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: Gossip usually isn't very reliable, but go on.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The King _5 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Oh I do love some juicy gossip now and then!
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The King _5 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I know very little of this King. Tell me what you've heard.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The King _5 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: A monarch with secrets. Typical.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The King _5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Not the good kind, I take it?
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The King _5 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Don't believe everything you hear.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The King _5 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Go on then, spill the beans.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The King _5 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: Well, they say he's a bit obsessed with Vaal artefacts. But something tells me this is quite a concern for the Kalguurans. I've noticed certain types of Vaal devices seem to up and disappear before being loaded onto ships headed for Kalguur.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The King _5 - L9 - A1.ogg]] ![[Makoru - Makoru on The King _5 - L9 - A2.ogg]] ![[Makoru - Makoru on The King _5 - L9 - A3.ogg]]

Warrior: Perhaps this King seeks something he ought not to have.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The King _5 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Hah! His own people are undermining his goals. Brilliant.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The King _5 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Treasonous actions. You should be careful with this information, Makoru.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The King _5 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Let the coward come and find what he wants himself then.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The King _5 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: The Kalguurans ought to be careful. A leaders wrath can be brutal.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The King _5 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Perhaps they protect him. Or... themselves. Intriguing.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The King _5 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Hah! Cheeky buggers. I'm startin' to really like these Kalguurans!
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The King _5 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: If you mention this, they will deny it, just like they did when I asked... And just like I will deny ever telling you this.

## Makoru on Arastas /3
Makoru: The first thing that grinning lot of fools did when they got here was build their enclave. The Twilight Order, they call themselves. Spend most of their time brain washing anyone who'll listen. And they've even got a decent chunk of Karui converted to their cause... whatever it may be. Bigger chunk of us can't stand them though, myself included.

Mercenary: I'll figure 'em out. Been in a fight with many a zealot back in Trarthus.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Arastas _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: I just think it's a dangerous game they're playing. Religion always is. I suppose we can visit them if you like, but I doubt it'll be very helpful.

In recent years, though, the trial became far more deadly. The things that nest there... they are vile things.

Makoru: You don't have to run some trial to be Karui. Blood is blood.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Shrike Island _4 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: It's not really the type of island outsiders should be trespassing on... But... let's do it anyway!

## Makoru on Shrike Island /4
Makoru: For generations, the Isle of Shrikes was used for a coming of age trial for several tribes. Young Karui try to sneak onto the rocks, climb the cliffs, and take the eggs of the shrikes that nest there. The eggs are a valuable delicacy that many Karui would pay through the nose for. In recent years, though, the trial became far more deadly. The things that nest there... they are vile things.

## Makoru on Whakapanu Island /3
Makoru: Whakapanu is one of the most beautiful islands in Ngamakanui. A tropical paradise. Some time ago, I heard that a Karui tribe decided to land and settle there. Maybe it would be worth asking if they've seen any sign of what you're looking for.

## Makoru on The Way /4
Makoru: My people's traditions have remained the same for thousands of years! Until {my} generation, that is... When I was just a young girl, Tukohama, the Karui god of war, was slain by a mortal. That turned my world upside down. Our own ancestor... killed by a mortal? I am looking for my own Way now. One that doesn't rely on gods or old traditions. I thought I might find my path in trade and commerce. So here I am, sailing for the Kalguurans. Other Karui like me have spread out across Wraeclast in search of meaning. The Elders call us {kaivana.} They think we have rejected the Way, that we dishonour our families.

Warrior: Do you take that to heart?
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The Way _4 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: One can guess what that means.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The Way _4 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I, too, was insulted for choosing my own destiny.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The Way _4 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: It's your life, not theirs. Live it how you choose.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The Way _4 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Oh, Makoru... I know that pain well.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The Way _4 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Is there nothing you can do to heal this wound?
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The Way _4 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: What's a {kaivana?}
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The Way _4 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: Not really. At least, not anymore.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The Way _4 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: Yes... one can.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The Way _4 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: Well, look at us now. We're doing okay.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The Way _4 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: Oh I do! Can't you tell? Heh.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The Way _4 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: It's not a pain I feel these days.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The Way _4 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: Time heals all wounds. As does following your own heart!
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The Way _4 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: It means {nothing} good.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on The Way _4 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: Now, when I was a young girl, I visited the Halls of the Dead... ... my ancestors told me that the Way was meant to empower us, not to control us! So who am I dishonouring by seeking {my} truth? It's a debate that I am tired of having. But either way, it has separated me from my family, and I must live with that.

## Makoru on Arastas /12
Warrior: These waters have long been Karui. Do the Elders speak of anything like a forge?
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Arastas _12 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Please tell me the Karui know something that might get this moving. We need an ancient forge.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Arastas _12 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I am seeking an island with ancient technology. Likely buried beneath the earth. Do the Karui tales mention anything like this?
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Arastas _12 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Makoru, have the Karui passed down any stories about an island with an ancient forge on it?
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Arastas _12 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: We must find an ancient forge. Have you lot heard anything about summat like that?
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Arastas _12 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: May I entreat the wisdom of the Karui? We are looking for an ancient forge.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Arastas _12 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Miss Makoru, please tell me you got some ideas about where to find an old forge, or an island with a bunch of ancient shite on it.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Arastas _12 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: I've never heard any mention of such a place.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Arastas _12 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Kanu: I have.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Arastas _12 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: Really? Where?
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Arastas _12 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Kanu: My old tribe tells a tale of a foreign medicine woman. It's a very old story. Took place after a great fire scoured the world. My ancestors had to dive into the sea, just to survive. When they came to the surface, they found a burned woman, floating in the tide.

Makoru: What's this have to do with a forge? Get to the point.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Arastas _12 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Kanu: She begged them to take her somewhere and promised to forge them a great reward. But... the toll was too heavy. She was too injured. And she died trying to use the forge. She was buried there.

Makoru: Where?
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Arastas _12 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Kanu: Arastas. Well... wasn't called that back then though.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Arastas _12 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: Arastas? Why didn't you mention this sooner?
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Arastas _12 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Kanu: Mention what? An old myth about a foreign woman who died trying to use a forge some unknown thousands of years ago? I only knew you were looking for pieces of some old artefact. I didn't hear nothing about looking for a forge!
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Arastas _12 - L17 - A1.ogg]] ![[Makoru - Makoru on Arastas _12 - L17 - A2.ogg]]

Warrior: That sounds promising. Let's set sail.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Arastas _12 - L18 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: That's quite a specific myth. If it's true, Arastas must be the place.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Arastas _12 - L19 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Well, it is at least something to investigate. We must go to Arastas.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Arastas _12 - L20 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: It seems we have no choice but to travel to Arastas.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Arastas _12 - L21 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: We're lucky you were here, Kanu. Let's try Arastas.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Arastas _12 - L22 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: The final piece of the puzzle becomes clear. Arastas is our destination.
 ![[Makoru - Makoru on Arastas _12 - L23 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: We need to work on our communication, mate. Sorry, {first mate.} Let's visit Arastas.

Makoru: So, a united Wraeclast sails at our back. Who would've thought? We'll split off and deliver you to Oriath harbour, as planned. Dark clouds gather on the horizon... guess that's our cue.
