Warrior: I'm here for information.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Introduction _5 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Hush now. I don't think so.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Introduction _5 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Please. Hold your tongue a moment. I need to know something...
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Introduction _5 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: I'm not here for bread.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Introduction _5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Please... you're givin' me a headache. I need information.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Introduction _5 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Enough. I am seeking information.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Introduction _5 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Quit it. I'm looking for some information.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Introduction _5 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Missionary Lorandis: I see. How can we assist you?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Introduction _5 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: I'm looking for an ancient forge. Have you seen anything like that here?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Introduction _5 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: I'd like to take a little tour of this island. See the sights.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Introduction _5 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Have you seen any signs of an ancient forge on this island?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Introduction _5 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: I'm looking for ancient ruins. There should be some here. Have you seen them?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Introduction _5 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Have you seen any worn old ruins on this island?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Introduction _5 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: I must find an ancient forge. I have reason to believe it's on this island.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Introduction _5 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: I'm lookin' for some real old ruins. Got any 'round here?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Introduction _5 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Missionary Lorandis: Hmm... I think I {may} be able to help. But it will require a notable member of the Order. Please, follow me.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Introduction _5 - L17 - A1.ogg]] ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Introduction _5 - L17 - A2.ogg]]


## Missionary Lorandis on Fight Back /3
Missionary Lorandis: Do you hear that, Kalguurans? Here is one who will join us in the fight! We will save this world together!
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Fight Back _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: Will you stop that? I've not yet joined any fight of yours.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Fight Back _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Great. Now he's yelling nonsense at the Kalguurans.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Fight Back _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Please, leave {them} and {me} out of this. You're making fools of us both.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Fight Back _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Excuse me. Do not assume I am onboard.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Fight Back _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Wait, wait! First of all, how are we saving the world?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Fight Back _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Keep your voice down. It's unbecoming.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Fight Back _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Sheesh. Keep it subtle, eh?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Fight Back _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Missionary Lorandis: Utopia is a dream, but Wraeclast is a nightmare. Let us choose which we live in, yes?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Fight Back _3 - L9 - A1.ogg]]


## Missionary Lorandis on Introduction /4
Warrior: Get on with it.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Introduction _4 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Oh, no. What are you selling?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Introduction _4 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Please. Go on.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Introduction _4 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: I'm listening.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Introduction _4 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Go on, then.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Introduction _4 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: You have my attention.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Introduction _4 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Alright. Let's have it then.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Introduction _4 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Missionary Lorandis: I am pleased to meet you. I am Lorandis. A missionary of the Twilight Order. But I am here to warn you... The end of days approaches. Something evil has awoken on Wraeclast. You have faced it, have you not? I can see it in your eyes. You have faced the wickedness in the hearts of men!
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Introduction _4 - L8 - A1.ogg]] ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Introduction _4 - L8 - A2.ogg]] ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Introduction _4 - L8 - A3.ogg]]

Warrior: Wickedness is all around us. It cannot be avoided.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Introduction _4 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Haven't we all? What of it?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Introduction _4 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Wickedness lies where we least expect. Yes. I know this.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Introduction _4 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Yes. Yes I have.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Introduction _4 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Aye. True enough.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Introduction _4 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: The hearts of men have always languished for more. What of it?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Introduction _4 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Sure. I've seen my fair share of wickedness.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Introduction _4 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Missionary Lorandis: They seek to conquer us, to rule us. We must act! We must fight back!
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Introduction _4 - L16 - A1.ogg]]


## Missionary Lorandis on Introduction /1
Missionary Lorandis: Friend, I have urgent news for you. Time is short and the unmaking of the world is nigh! Please, listen to what I have to say.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Introduction _1 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Introduction _1 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Introduction _1 - L1 - A3.ogg]]


## Missionary Lorandis on Kalguurans /5
Missionary Lorandis: We do not despise the Kalguurans. We merely consider them lucky fools... In their faraway land, they have no concept of the problems we face here! So they do not take our struggle seriously.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Kalguurans _5 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Kalguurans _5 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Kalguurans _5 - L1 - A3.ogg]]

Warrior: What of the Kalguurans {here}? They seem honourable.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Kalguurans _5 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: No gods, no Corruption. What do they do for fun?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Kalguurans _5 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: What rubbish. They seem very honourable to me. They are wondrous people.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Kalguurans _5 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: We've always been on our own. Why should they help us?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Kalguurans _5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: We should be working together. Can we win them over?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Kalguurans _5 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: What of it? Do we care about the struggles on their distant continent?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Kalguurans _5 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Everywhere's got problems, believe me.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Kalguurans _5 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Missionary Lorandis: Kalguurans are not like us. They stand apart. Their souls are clean. No Divinity, no Corruption. Wraeclast has gods capable of horrors beyond comprehension. Yet their sole fear looms largest - their aging tyrant King. Absurd.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Kalguurans _5 - L9 - A1.ogg]] ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Kalguurans _5 - L9 - A2.ogg]] ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Kalguurans _5 - L9 - A3.ogg]]

Warrior: None of them talk about their King. Do you know something?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Kalguurans _5 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Absurd {is} the word. What is their King trying to do, anyway?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Kalguurans _5 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Some gods can lead their people to glory. Kings only cause suffering.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Kalguurans _5 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Have they told you about their King? What's his aim?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Kalguurans _5 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Why do they fear their King?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Kalguurans _5 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: We fear the danger we know more than the danger that lurks on the horizon.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Kalguurans _5 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Their King? What's he up to, anyhow?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Kalguurans _5 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Missionary Lorandis: The Kalguuran King seeks Vaal artefacts. I know not why, but the reason must be sordid. The Vaal destroyed themselves. We will not make the same mistake.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Kalguurans _5 - L17 - A1.ogg]] ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Kalguurans _5 - L17 - A2.ogg]]


## Missionary Lorandis on Servitor Marius /5
Missionary Lorandis: Ah. So you've met Servitor Marius. A diligent Shepherd of Tomorrow.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Servitor Marius _5 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: He was not very forthcoming about what you believe in.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Servitor Marius _5 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: He wanted a lot, but gave nothing.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Servitor Marius _5 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I didn't get much information from him. Quite strange.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Servitor Marius _5 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: He told me nothing really.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Servitor Marius _5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Why was he afraid to tell me anything?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Servitor Marius _5 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Marius did not wish to part with any important details of your Order.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Servitor Marius _5 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Seemed a bit dodgy. Sounded like he wasn't sure what to share and what not to.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Servitor Marius _5 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Missionary Lorandis: Oh! We just have very particular roles, you see. He is a Servitor. He tends to the congregation. Quite an important task. I am a missionary. My role is to spread word to those willing to hear about the New Tomorrow.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Servitor Marius _5 - L9 - A1.ogg]] ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Servitor Marius _5 - L9 - A2.ogg]] ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Servitor Marius _5 - L9 - A3.ogg]]

Warrior: So you keep close watch over the story...
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Servitor Marius _5 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: So you're the {better} manipulator...
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Servitor Marius _5 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Ah. So you're in charge of how the Order is perceived...
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Servitor Marius _5 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: So you control the narrative...
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Servitor Marius _5 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: I see. So he's not allowed to talk much...
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Servitor Marius _5 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: So {his} tongue is bound, while {yours} is free...
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Servitor Marius _5 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: So his role is to shut up? Charming.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Servitor Marius _5 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Missionary Lorandis: Don't worry, friend. It all becomes clearer the closer you get. With a large operation such as ours, defined roles are an important part of achieving success. So many moving parts, the world over. It is freeing knowing your place in it all! I am very pleased you are showing such interest in our efforts!
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Servitor Marius _5 - L17 - A1.ogg]] ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Servitor Marius _5 - L17 - A2.ogg]] ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Servitor Marius _5 - L17 - A3.ogg]] ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Servitor Marius _5 - L17 - A4.ogg]]


## Missionary Lorandis on Pledge /1
Missionary Lorandis: You are interested, yes? I knew it! Visit Arastas when you are sure you are ready.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Pledge _1 - L1 - A1.ogg]]


## Missionary Lorandis on Saviour /6
Missionary Lorandis: Our Saviour is a mere mortal, like you or I... only, better. The Saviour is being raised free from the corruption of wickedness. This... this is the key to our success. If you wish to know more, you should visit our enclave on Arastas. It is not too far from here!
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Saviour _6 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Saviour _6 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Saviour _6 - L1 - A3.ogg]] ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Saviour _6 - L1 - A4.ogg]]

Missionary Lorandis: As we speak, the Karui flock to our island. Eager to join the cause and save Wraeclast!
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Saviour _6 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: That alone must cause Tavakai great concern.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Saviour _6 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: The Chieftain must be {really} pleased about that.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Saviour _6 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: That is particularly distressing for the Chieftain.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Saviour _6 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: You've caused great upset in these parts.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Saviour _6 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: You're causing harm... luring young Karui there.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Saviour _6 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: You are part of the cause of Tavakai's ill temper.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Saviour _6 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Tavakai would have a word with you, I'd say...
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Saviour _6 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: I'll see if I can find time.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Saviour _6 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Sounds like torture. We shall see.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Saviour _6 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I will consider it.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Saviour _6 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: I'll think about it.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Saviour _6 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Perhaps I will.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Saviour _6 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: I go where I am guided.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Saviour _6 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: I might have a look. Dunno.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Saviour _6 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Missionary Lorandis: It will all be clear to the Chieftain in time. So... will you pledge yourself to the Twilight Order?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Saviour _6 - L17 - A1.ogg]] ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Saviour _6 - L17 - A2.ogg]]

Missionary Lorandis: You will not regret your visit. There, you'll have the chance to pledge to the Twilight Order.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Saviour _6 - L18 - A1.ogg]]


## Missionary Lorandis on Success /6
Warrior: What does 'success' look like to the Order?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Success _6 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: How do you {measure} success?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Success _6 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: So how will you know when you have succeeded?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Success _6 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: When will your mission be over?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Success _6 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: How do you know if you've accomplished what you need to?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Success _6 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: What is success to you?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Success _6 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: What's it look like to you, all said and done?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Success _6 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Missionary Lorandis: No more pain. No more suffering. No more horrors upon the world. A fresh start. A time we can be proud of. Wraeclast is beleaguered by the most detestable of creations. Unnatural creations. Creations that manipulate our existence. Their time must come to an end!
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Success _6 - L8 - A1.ogg]] ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Success _6 - L8 - A2.ogg]] ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Success _6 - L8 - A3.ogg]] ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Success _6 - L8 - A4.ogg]] ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Success _6 - L8 - A5.ogg]]

Warrior: Do you mean... gods?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Success _6 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Oh of course, you're talking about Divinity.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Success _6 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Hmm. I am not sure I follow what you mean.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Success _6 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Sounds like mankind to me...
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Success _6 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Who do you speak of? Beasts? {Rathin}?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Success _6 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: The Gods.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Success _6 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Who the heck are you talking about?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Success _6 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Missionary Lorandis: The gods must never come back. And Divinity must forever return to its dormancy within whatever void it sprung from. Our Saviour is almost ready... He will remake the world. A world free of Divinity. And thus, a world free of Corruption.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Success _6 - L16 - A1.ogg]] ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Success _6 - L16 - A2.ogg]] ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Success _6 - L16 - A3.ogg]]

Warrior: And how will the Saviour achieve this?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Success _6 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Evangelists hard at work. I must say, I am not compelled.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Success _6 - L18 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: The gods are responsible for much pain... but also, much beauty.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Success _6 - L19 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: The First Ones have never brought me harm. Why should I fear them?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Success _6 - L20 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: The Spirit is all I know. It's outside the folly of man... which gods are not.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Success _6 - L21 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: The gods are flawed. Divinity is flawed. As they are derived from man. But the Dreamer... he is without these deficiencies.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Success _6 - L22 - A1.ogg]] ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Success _6 - L22 - A2.ogg]]

Mercenary: The gods have caused these lands a lot of trouble. I can see that.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Success _6 - L23 - A1.ogg]]

Missionary Lorandis: Utopia will not remember these gods. They will have no name there. They will never be, nor will they ever have been. Praise be in Utopia's name! Praise be upon the Saviour! Now... are you ready to take the pledge?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Success _6 - L24 - A1.ogg]] ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Success _6 - L24 - A2.ogg]] ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Success _6 - L24 - A3.ogg]]


## Missionary Lorandis on Twilight Order /3
Missionary Lorandis: We are an order of true believers dedicated to the salvation of humanity! To that end, we have given everything, and will continue to give of ourselves until Wraeclast is saved.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Twilight Order _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Twilight Order _3 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

Warrior: You make a good sales pitch. But what is the catch?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Twilight Order _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Sounds too good to be true. Probably is.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Twilight Order _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Your cause sounds admirable. But just as the sands, nothing is perfect.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Twilight Order _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: I don't really know what to make of any of it. It sounds unrealistic.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Twilight Order _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: If you lot are trying hard to do the right thing... I can't condemn ya.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Twilight Order _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: If humanity can even be saved, is it really in your power to do so?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Twilight Order _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Sounds good on the tin. But I'm curious what's behind it all.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Twilight Order _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Missionary Lorandis: Friend, we are on the same side! Surely, you will pledge yourself to aid in the cause!
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Twilight Order _3 - L9 - A1.ogg]]


## Missionary Lorandis on Utopia /3
Missionary Lorandis: Utopia is not possible while wickedness in the hearts of men can be rewarded so extravagantly. Our Saviour will bring about that utopia, and in it, you shall be free. We all shall be free! There will be none to rule you, none to tell you how to live.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Utopia _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Utopia _3 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Utopia _3 - L1 - A3.ogg]]

Warrior: It is already the case. I am my own man.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Utopia _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Do you see anyone pulling my strings?
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Utopia _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I am a free woman. Banished... but free.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Utopia _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: No one owns {me} - missionary.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Utopia _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Only the Spirit may lay claim upon me. I welcome it.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Utopia _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: The Dreamer does not enforce. Simply guides.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Utopia _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Ain't no one telling me how to do nothing.
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Utopia _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Missionary Lorandis: Please understand... It will be a glorious thing to behold. The struggle for freedom from tyranny will finally be over!
 ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Utopia _3 - L9 - A1.ogg]] ![[Missionary Lorandis - Missionary Lorandis on Utopia _3 - L9 - A2.ogg]]
