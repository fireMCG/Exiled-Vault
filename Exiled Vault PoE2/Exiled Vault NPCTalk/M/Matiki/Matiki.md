## Matiki on Ancestors /10
Matiki: When we speak of our ancestors and their wisdom, it's not just poetic. All Karui since the time of Tukohama linger here still, in the Halls of the Dead. Their advice and counsel is our greatest source of strength.

Warrior: Elder... please tell me, do I have ancestors here?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Ancestors _10 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Of course. Do you know their names? Their song?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Ancestors _10 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: I... do not.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Ancestors _10 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: I'm sorry, child, but there are countless souls here. Without a name and a tribe, we cannot find them. Would they recognise your face?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Ancestors _10 - L5 - A1.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Ancestors _10 - L5 - A2.ogg]]

Warrior: No. I was lost as a boy.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Ancestors _10 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: That is most unfortunate. My heart goes out to you. When this time of trouble is over... I'll ask around on your behalf.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Ancestors _10 - L7 - A1.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Ancestors _10 - L7 - A2.ogg]]

Witch: I underestimated the Karui. Necromancy is woven into the fabric of your culture.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Ancestors _10 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: We have something like this, the {barya.} Not on this scale, of course. We mainly use them as punishment for criminals...
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Ancestors _10 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: It seems wrong to keep souls out of the natural order.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Ancestors _10 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: When we Azmeri die, we rejoin the Spirit. Our voices become one.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Ancestors _10 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Ah, that is how your Way can be enforced so strongly. The knowledge is not lost.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Ancestors _10 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Think I'd rather take a dirt nap. Imagine never getting a break from being {you.}
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Ancestors _10 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Necro what now? Well... I don't know about that.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Ancestors _10 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: This place is no punishment... It is a blessing!
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Ancestors _10 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: For us, this is natural.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Ancestors _10 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: One voice for all your people? That'd never work for the Karui...
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Ancestors _10 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Yes. No teaching is lost if the teacher lives on!
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Ancestors _10 - L18 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: It is a curious thought. But... you can always strive to keep learning something new!
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Ancestors _10 - L19 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: In anycase, my feelings on all this {are} complicated, but the Way was established long before my time. Sometimes it really just is... what it is.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Ancestors _10 - L20 - A1.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Ancestors _10 - L20 - A2.ogg]]


## Matiki on Being an Elder /8
Warrior: How does one become an Elder?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Being an Elder _8 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: So, are you just well aged, or is there a ritual required to become an Elder?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Being an Elder _8 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Is your title of Elder a special duty? How does one become such a thing?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Being an Elder _8 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Tell me - how did you become an Elder?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Being an Elder _8 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: We've Elders, too. How'd you become one?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Being an Elder _8 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Why do they call you Elder? Is it a title? How did you earn it?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Being an Elder _8 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Is Elder a rank? Did you work your way up or somethin'?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Being an Elder _8 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Becoming an Elder... hmm. Good question.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Being an Elder _8 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Kaimana: It simply requires being old... and not dead yet.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Being an Elder _8 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Oh come now, Kaimana. A bit of wisdom as well.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Being an Elder _8 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Yes! I have plenty of {all} that.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Being an Elder _8 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Kaimana: I am just making fun, yes? Matiki became an Elder during the worst plague of Blood Fever these shores have ever seen... Hmmm. He gave himself. All of himself. Without a care, yes? I still don't know how he survived. But many would not have, had he not been so brave... and well, so... wise.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Being an Elder _8 - L12 - A1.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Being an Elder _8 - L12 - A2.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Being an Elder _8 - L12 - A3.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Being an Elder _8 - L12 - A4.ogg]]

Matiki: You honour me, Kaimana.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Being an Elder _8 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Kaimana: Yes. Deserved.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Being an Elder _8 - L14 - A1.ogg]]


## Matiki on Eye of Hinekora /6
Makoru: You want to take them to the Karui's most sacred place? Were you hit on the head?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _6 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Trust me. My hero here... is special. They deserve a chance to prove themselves to our ancestors.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _6 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: Tavakai will lose his mind if he finds out about this...
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _6 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Ah. Well, perhaps in this case it's best for him to only hear what he needs to hear.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _6 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: Alright, but after this I'm taking you back to Ngakanu.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _6 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Yes, yes... that's fine.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _6 - L6 - A1.ogg]]


## Matiki on Eye of Hinekora /9
Matiki: Ah, Makoru! It is good to see you.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _9 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Makoru: Matiki! You're alive! I'd heard you were missing.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _9 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Yes. They told me I was too old to keep taking out my canoe... maybe they were right.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _9 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: From canoe to a cage. What happened out there?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _9 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: You went out on a canoe... and ended up {there?}
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _9 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Tell us, Matiki... how did you find yourself caged?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _9 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: From canoeing to trapped in a cage... explain yourself.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _9 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Sounds like you had a rough day at sea.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _9 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Matiki... how'd you end up caged like that?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _9 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Went out for a nice row then found yourself caged up, right?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _9 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: It is quite the tale... ... and I was weak. I admit. When the fog swept over the water... I should've known what I saw wasn't real! But there she was. My Rakana. Sweet and strong as the day we met. She plowed on through the fog. And I chased her like she was alive! Like we were young again. Then... crash! Next thing I know... I'm wet as anything and cooped up in that bloody cage.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _9 - L11 - A1.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _9 - L11 - A2.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _9 - L11 - A3.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _9 - L11 - A4.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _9 - L11 - A5.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _9 - L11 - A6.ogg]]

Makoru: Good thing our patron here got there when they did.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _9 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Yes! And about that... There is the small matter of what I've promised our hero here...
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _9 - L13 - A1.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _9 - L13 - A2.ogg]]

Makoru: Why do I get the feeling this involves me?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _9 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Show me your map, Makoru. There's a place I want to take our friend, when they have the time.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _9 - L15 - A1.ogg]]


## Matiki on Eye of Hinekora /1
Matiki: Yes... there it is. The Eye of Hinekora. Gateway... to the Halls of the Dead!
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _1 - L1 - A1.ogg]]


## Matiki on The Mother of Death /8
Matiki: Hinekora... has spoken. You are worthy! Prove to our ancestors that which I already know to be true.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on The Mother of Death _8 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: Wait... am I dead?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on The Mother of Death _8 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: What... What just happened? Am I dead?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on The Mother of Death _8 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Why am I on the ground!?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on The Mother of Death _8 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: I... am dead, aren't I?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on The Mother of Death _8 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: What just happened? Why is my body {there}?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on The Mother of Death _8 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: What in the Spirit is goin' on here?!
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on The Mother of Death _8 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Well blimey. I'm bloody well dead, aren't I?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on The Mother of Death _8 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Oh... in a manner of speaking... yes. You are dead. But do not worry. The Mother of Death has you in her embrace.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on The Mother of Death _8 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Well... put simply... you are dead. But do not worry. The Mother of Death has you in her embrace.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on The Mother of Death _8 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Your body will be safe here, while your spirit moves forward to prove yourself to our ancestors.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on The Mother of Death _8 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: You might have told me that this was going to happen!
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on The Mother of Death _8 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: So this is what Death feels like from the other side...
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on The Mother of Death _8 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Matiki... you might have told me I was about to die.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on The Mother of Death _8 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Death is not nearly so fearsome an experience as I expected.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on The Mother of Death _8 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Dying was not exactly what I was expecting to happen.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on The Mother of Death _8 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: I guess I've no choice but to trust in Hinekora.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on The Mother of Death _8 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: I should be mad at ya... But dying ain't so bad, is it? I feel like I lost a bit of weight.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on The Mother of Death _8 - L18 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: I didn't want to worry you about it!
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on The Mother of Death _8 - L19 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Not too bad, eh?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on The Mother of Death _8 - L20 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Hmm... maybe I should have, yes. Oh well!
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on The Mother of Death _8 - L21 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Surprise! Heheh.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on The Mother of Death _8 - L22 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: She will look after your soul. Do not worry.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on The Mother of Death _8 - L23 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Quite soothing really, isn't it?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on The Mother of Death _8 - L24 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Hah! Yes, lighter on your feet, perhaps?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on The Mother of Death _8 - L25 - A1.ogg]]

Navali: You may enter. We will be watching.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on The Mother of Death _8 - L26 - A1.ogg]]


## Matiki on Eye of Hinekora /3
Matiki: We call this place... the Eye of Hinekora. Far below, Hinekora herself resides. She, The Mother of Death, sees the choices we have made, and from that... has foresight of the path ahead. Now. This here... this is Navali. She is the Speaker. The word of the will of Hinekora. Oh! And that on her shoulder... that's Yama. He's a good boy.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _3 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _3 - L1 - A3.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _3 - L1 - A4.ogg]]

Warrior: I am honoured to meet you, Navali. And Yama.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Greetings, Speaker. I cannot wait to meet your goddess. And hello, monkey.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Good day, Navali. Greetings, Yama.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: You are a curious sort, Navali. I am intrigued to know more about your master. And... Yes, hello Yama.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Hello, Navali and Yama. If I get the chance, I look forward to asking Hinekora some rather... personal questions.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Spirit watch over you, Navali. And monkey.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Well, pleased to meet you Navali. Also, nice monkey.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Navali: The Elder's tale of your victory is well received. He vouches for you. But that is not quite enough... The Mother of Death must decide if you may enter. Step forth. Look into the bowl. Hinekora will see you. All of you.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _3 - L9 - A1.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _3 - L9 - A2.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _3 - L9 - A3.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _3 - L9 - A4.ogg]]


## Matiki on Great Wasting /6
Matiki: Each tribe has its own story of the Great Wasting. Some call it a Great Fire, or the Barren Centuries. Others, an Endless Winter. The truth lies buried in all these tales. There was an ancient time of horror and famine. But in those dark years, our gods first stepped forward. Tukohama, Hinekora, Tawhoa, and the rest.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Great Wasting _6 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Great Wasting _6 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Great Wasting _6 - L1 - A3.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Great Wasting _6 - L1 - A4.ogg]]

Warrior: The Karui had no gods before that?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Great Wasting _6 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: {All} your gods appeared then? There weren't any before that?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Great Wasting _6 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: We call it the Winter of the World... The Maraketh had no gods before that. Did you?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Great Wasting _6 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: You had no gods before the Great Wasting?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Great Wasting _6 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: We know the Winter. Did you not have gods before then?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Great Wasting _6 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Curious. All your gods arose in the same era? None before that?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Great Wasting _6 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: You telling me you didn't have gods before these bad times?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Great Wasting _6 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: No. For us, history begins there. The Great Wasting erased all that came before. Maybe... there wasn't even a {before,} for us. When did the first Karui emerge from that volcano? Something to ask Hinekora, Navali.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Great Wasting _6 - L9 - A1.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Great Wasting _6 - L9 - A2.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Great Wasting _6 - L9 - A3.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Great Wasting _6 - L9 - A4.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Great Wasting _6 - L9 - A5.ogg]]

Navali: The Mother of Death can recall only her own memories. History begins at the rise of the gods, because that is when Hinekora was born.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Great Wasting _6 - L10 - A1.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Great Wasting _6 - L10 - A2.ogg]]

Matiki: Hmm. Curious. So the End of Time, as she recalls it, is really... her death.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Great Wasting _6 - L11 - A1.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Great Wasting _6 - L11 - A2.ogg]]

Navali: Yes.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Great Wasting _6 - L12 - A1.ogg]]


## Matiki on Halls of the Dead /6
Matiki: The Halls of the Dead are open to the worthy, and their children. We come here to consult with our ancestors in times of great need.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Halls of the Dead _6 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Halls of the Dead _6 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

Navali: Your ancestors take heart from seeing their descendants.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Halls of the Dead _6 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: It's good to hear that, but it's not all so kindhearted. When the sky permits, we come to watch the Trials of the Ancestors. The living may only see it properly under the light of a full moon.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Halls of the Dead _6 - L3 - A1.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Halls of the Dead _6 - L3 - A2.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Halls of the Dead _6 - L3 - A3.ogg]]

Warrior: The light of the moon? Why is that needed?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Halls of the Dead _6 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: The light of a full moon? This deep?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Halls of the Dead _6 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Why is that?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Halls of the Dead _6 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: The moon, eh? How's that work?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Halls of the Dead _6 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: How does the light reach them down here?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Halls of the Dead _6 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: How's that then?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Halls of the Dead _6 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Well, you see... great crystal veins guide the light down on certain nights of the year. Warrior souls can be seen by the grace of Lani Hua.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Halls of the Dead _6 - L10 - A1.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Halls of the Dead _6 - L10 - A2.ogg]]

Navali: It is a gift from a goddess who cannot be with us in person.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Halls of the Dead _6 - L11 - A1.ogg]]


## Matiki on Kanu and Makoru /8
Matiki: It was wonderful to see those Makoru and Kanu again... it has been some time.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Kanu and Makoru _8 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: What keeps them away?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Kanu and Makoru _8 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: I assumed they weren't welcome here.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Kanu and Makoru _8 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Are they forbidden to enter this place?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Kanu and Makoru _8 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: They're allowed to come here?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Kanu and Makoru _8 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: What keeps them away?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Kanu and Makoru _8 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Too long, perhaps? I wonder what keeps them from visiting.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Kanu and Makoru _8 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Do they have permission to visit?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Kanu and Makoru _8 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: We don't stop them.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Kanu and Makoru _8 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: That's right. We don't. It is their choice not to come.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Kanu and Makoru _8 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Kaimana: But that is not the whole story, mmm? They left the tribe. They bear that burden. They know where your heart is, Tavakai.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Kanu and Makoru _8 - L11 - A1.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Kanu and Makoru _8 - L11 - A2.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Kanu and Makoru _8 - L11 - A3.ogg]]

Matiki: Yes. Though they {know} they can come, it does not mean they {feel} they can.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Kanu and Makoru _8 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: It is still their choice. And they have made it.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Kanu and Makoru _8 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Kaimana: Yes. They have. For now.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Kanu and Makoru _8 - L14 - A1.ogg]]


## Matiki on Eye of Hinekora /44
Matiki: {Tala moana}! Oh... you're one of us but from somewhere else. Hmm.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: Yes. Born Karui. Traded as property. Then left to the tide to wash ashore. And finally... raised an Ezomyte.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: You have lived many lives. Hard though, it is true. But now... your skin is thicker than most.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: Some scars never heal.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Well... on this day, by your actions, you have honoured an Elder of the Tukohama tribe. My name is Matiki. And I owe you a debt of thanks.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L5 - A1.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L5 - A2.ogg]]

Warrior: You need not thank me, Matiki. I am just glad I got here in time to help you.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Humble too! Hmm... Well, I shall thank you. I would honour you in the best way I can. I offer you the blessing of our ancestors. They know the true merit of a warrior!
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L7 - A1.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L7 - A2.ogg]]

Matiki: {Tala moana}, my dear! You have travelled far, haven't you!
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Well, you're awfully cheery for someone who was almost eaten alive.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Ah, yes... almost! It seems old Matiki has more to do in life before he is summoned to the Halls of the Dead.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Halls of the Dead? Okay, you have my attention.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: You see, I'm an Elder of the Tukohama tribe. And I have something in mind for you... I would honour you the best way I can, dear lady. With the blessing of our ancestors! They can tell if someone is worthy of their honour, and you have strength in you.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L12 - A1.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L12 - A2.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L12 - A3.ogg]]

Matiki: {Tala moana}, tale-woman! It's been many a year since old Matiki has seen one of your kind in the flesh!
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Not quite a tale-woman but... it is a fair assumption. Greetings to you, Matiki.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: There is always more to the story. I knew that even before I was an Elder of the Tukohama tribe! Now... I must honour you the best way that I can. With the blessing of our ancestors! If you are worthy, they will see you for who you are... and more. Quite clever really.

Matiki: {Tala moana}, young man! An impressive display you put on there.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Well... that display saved your life, it seems.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Indeed it did! My name is Matiki, an Elder of the Tukohama tribe. And I must thank you for saving my life.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L18 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: I accept your thanks.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L19 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Oh, no, no! I can't leave that debt unpaid. I would honour you the best way that I can... With the blessing of our ancestors! Prove yourself to them. Show them your might.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L20 - A1.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L20 - A2.ogg]]

Monk: I'm unfamiliar with Karui traditions. Enlighten me.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L21 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: {Tala moana}, stranger! My eyes could barely keep up with you. Remarkable!
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L22 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: You are safe, for now. Best you get going.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L23 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Oh, no. I must thank you first. As an Elder of the Tukohama tribe, I have something in mind...
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L24 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Please. It isn't necessary... I can just be on my way and then you never have to–
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L25 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: You'll have the opportunity to gain the blessing of our ancestors!
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L26 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: But I really don't–
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L27 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Yes! A perfect reward, indeed.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L28 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Guess there's no way around this. Go on, then.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L29 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Do my eyes tell lies? Do I see an Azmeri before me?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L30 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Your eyes tell the truth.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L31 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Wow. What a sight for Matiki's old eyes. As an Elder of the Tukohama tribe, age tends to reveal fewer surprises as the years pass.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L32 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Elder? I'm truly honoured to meet you. Even more so to have saved you.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L33 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Ah, the grace of the Azmeri. Not something often spoken of. But your people and mine, have an abundance of similarities. Now... I must thank you for what you've done this day.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L34 - A1.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L34 - A2.ogg]]

Huntress: It's not needed, you know...
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L35 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: You shall have the opportunity to gain the blessing of our ancestors! Prove your worth to them. Show them what you showed me here.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L36 - A1.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L36 - A2.ogg]]

Matiki: {Tala moana}, outsider! I can't quite make out your origins... hmm...
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L37 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Just out here doing what I can. Doesn't really matter where I'm from.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L38 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: True enough. Old Matiki can't help his curiosity. I've been an Elder of the Tukohama tribe for many years and it's not often I get stumped like this.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L39 - A1.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L39 - A2.ogg]]

Mercenary: An Elder, eh? Tavakai would likely be pleased for you to be returned in one piece...
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L40 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Oh, yes. I'm sure the Chieftain had concerns. But first...
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L41 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: I must thank you for your good deed here. You've honoured me. I must honour you back. I will give you the opportunity to gain the blessing of our ancestors! Show them your prowess. They will see you for who you are.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L42 - A1.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L42 - A2.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L42 - A3.ogg]]

Mercenary: Uhh... hopefully they don't see too much.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L43 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Let us return to your ship. I will show you the way to our most sacred place... the Eye of Hinekora. From there... I will speak for you to enter our Halls of the Dead. You will be tested. But also, rewarded.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L44 - A1.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Eye of Hinekora _44 - L44 - A2.ogg]]


## Matiki on The Mother of Death /3
Matiki: So... you did it! I knew you could. I knew... you would.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on The Mother of Death _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: This has been exhilarating. It was an honour to meet Hinekora.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on The Mother of Death _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: The old woman's got true power. I wouldn't mind picking her brain someday.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on The Mother of Death _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Hinekora... is the true tale-woman of this world and beyond. It is... humbling.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on The Mother of Death _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: I see now. I'm part of something bigger. Hinekora has shown me that.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on The Mother of Death _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: It's wondrous. As if, somehow, maybe... the Spirit knew I would end up here. Seeing her.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on The Mother of Death _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: I was destined for this. To be here, witnessing all I have seen. I am now certain of it.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on The Mother of Death _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Not much impresses me anymore, but Miss Hinekora... now that's someone worth believing in.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on The Mother of Death _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Ah, yes. The Mother of Death is truly a wonder. I hope you have enjoyed your time here... And perhaps learned a little along the way. I look forward to seeing what you achieve next.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on The Mother of Death _3 - L9 - A1.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on The Mother of Death _3 - L9 - A2.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on The Mother of Death _3 - L9 - A3.ogg]]


## Matiki on The Mother of Death /3
Matiki: So... you did it! I knew you could. I knew... you would. I am proud of you!
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on The Mother of Death _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Did what?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on The Mother of Death _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Oh... no matter. Not really anything significant. Hah.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on The Mother of Death _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]


## Matiki on Hinekora /5
Matiki: At the end of our lives, Hinekora catches the {Ngakuramakoi} in her embrace.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Hinekora _5 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Navali: Death is not the end. The Halls of the Dead are merely the first rest on a long journey.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Hinekora _5 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: A journey? To where?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Hinekora _5 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Tell me what you know of Death, sister.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Hinekora _5 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: The first rest? What lies after?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Hinekora _5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: What natural journey is your 'first rest' interfering with?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Hinekora _5 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: You don't rejoin the Spirit? What's next, then?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Hinekora _5 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: What do you believe happens after?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Hinekora _5 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: How long a journey? Further than Trarthus? Kalguur?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Hinekora _5 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Navali: That is not for man or god to know.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Hinekora _5 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Ah, in other words, we have no idea, hahaha! But the Halls give us some comfort from total oblivion, at least.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Hinekora _5 - L11 - A1.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Hinekora _5 - L11 - A2.ogg]]


## Matiki on Trial of the Ancestors /9
Matiki: You'll never see anything like it as long as you live! All of our greatest warriors from history on the same field, no holding back. After all, why pull punches? They're already dead!
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Trial of the Ancestors _9 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Trial of the Ancestors _9 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Trial of the Ancestors _9 - L1 - A3.ogg]]

Navali: The Trial is not a sport. It is a sacred tradition.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Trial of the Ancestors _9 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Can't it be both? Different tribes shoulder-to-shoulder, cheering on their heroes. We bring meat and ale. We make a real night of it.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Trial of the Ancestors _9 - L3 - A1.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Trial of the Ancestors _9 - L3 - A2.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Trial of the Ancestors _9 - L3 - A3.ogg]]

Navali: I suppose there is joy in community and competition. Just don't speak this way in front of Hinekora.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Trial of the Ancestors _9 - L4 - A1.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Trial of the Ancestors _9 - L4 - A2.ogg]]

Matiki: I wouldn't dream of it.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Trial of the Ancestors _9 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: Surely she hears us here...
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Trial of the Ancestors _9 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Can she hear us? Here?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Trial of the Ancestors _9 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Can your goddess hear us now?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Trial of the Ancestors _9 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Does she hear us here?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Trial of the Ancestors _9 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Can she hear us?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Trial of the Ancestors _9 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Can Hinekora hear us now?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Trial of the Ancestors _9 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: What, I thought she could hear us in here.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Trial of the Ancestors _9 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Hinekora: I do.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Trial of the Ancestors _9 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Praise the Mother of Death!
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Trial of the Ancestors _9 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Navali: Indeed.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Trial of the Ancestors _9 - L15 - A1.ogg]]


## Matiki on Tukohama /6
Matiki: The gods were once mortal. They hunted, fished, and ate like we do. Many of Tukohama's deeds were achieved {before} his ascension.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Tukohama _6 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Tukohama _6 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

Warrior: What were his deeds?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Tukohama _6 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: I suppose one must achieve great things to become divine.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Tukohama _6 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Tell me. I'll carry his tale.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Tukohama _6 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: As just a man? What did he do?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Tukohama _6 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: And what did he achieve, as a mortal?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Tukohama _6 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: What exactly was he capable of doing as a mere mortal?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Tukohama _6 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Ah yeah. What'd that fella get up to then?
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Tukohama _6 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Yes. Indeed.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Tukohama _6 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: During the Great Wasting, he united the tribes. He put axes in our hands, and taught us to survive. But he was not just a... bringer of violence. No. He was a bringer of hope. Hope among all the tribes. Some forget that.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Tukohama _6 - L10 - A1.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Tukohama _6 - L10 - A2.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Tukohama _6 - L10 - A3.ogg]] ![[Matiki - Matiki on Tukohama _6 - L10 - A4.ogg]]

Navali: Some {choose} to forget.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Tukohama _6 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Exactly.
 ![[Matiki - Matiki on Tukohama _6 - L12 - A1.ogg]]
