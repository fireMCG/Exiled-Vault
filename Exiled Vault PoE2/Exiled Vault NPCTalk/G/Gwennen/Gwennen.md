## Gwennen on Alva /1
Gwennen: Her pluckiness really gets on a persons nerves over the years... Or so I assume. That it would. Eventually.

## Gwennen on The Cataclysm /1
Gwennen: Yet another Cataclysm on Wraeclast. What happened this time? You didn't reach Oriath soon enough? Hmm... when exactly did it happen? The ship had just gotten to the harbour... alright... Tell me everything. I'll memorise every detail. For... posterity. And I'll have Alva write it down.

## Gwennen on Exhausted /1
Gwennen: When you've been on a quest as long as I have, you tend to wind down a bit. Sometimes, I get the whole gang back together for a run or two. But mostly, it's just me... over and over...

## Gwennen on Expeditions /1
Gwennen: The relics of our ancestors are where they're supposed to be, at least... Which is to say, scattered all over? Ugh, this job is pure chaos.

## Gwennen on Introduction /1
Gwennen: Hello again! I... I mean, that is to say, my husband's told me all about you... you're the local that caused such a ruckus! I'm Gwennen, his luckier half. And his more exhausted half. Let's put you to work then, shall we?
