## Jado on Open Door /1
Jado: This is where the Gifting would normally be enacted. It seems they have made their way into the sacred chamber. This could bode ill for Rashi. I will open the way.

## Jado on The First Barya /7
Jado: It is done.
 ![[Jado - Jado on The First Barya _7 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Jado: The First {Barya} is safe. I will take it back to the surviving {sel khari}.
 ![[Jado - Jado on The First Barya _7 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Sekhema Asala: No. We must conduct the Gifting of Water as soon as possible.
 ![[Jado - Jado on The First Barya _7 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Jado: You would still enact the ritual after such disruption?
 ![[Jado - Jado on The First Barya _7 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Sekhema Asala: Yes... greater things are at stake. The Maraketh must unify, so that we can go to war. Let us return and prepare.

Sekhema Asala: Yes... greater things are at stake. The Maraketh must unify, so that we can go to war. Now, we must clear the way for the other akharas to attend... Let us return and prepare.

Jado: What impressive work. You may not see the Order of the Djinn in Oriath, but we'll be there... doing what we can. May you have warm nights on your journey.

## Jado on Azmadi /8
Jado: If Azmadi {has} been empowered by Zarokh, they must have met. And to have met, Azmadi must have completed the ancient Trial of the {Sekhemas}.
 ![[Jado - Jado on Azmadi _8 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Jado - Jado on Azmadi _8 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

Sekhema Asala: Nonsense! The mere notion is absurd!
 ![[Jado - Jado on Azmadi _8 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Jado: Is it? In your heart of hearts, do you believe it impossible that a Faridun survived the test? Perhaps he made it to Zarokh... then, facing his doom, cut a deal.
 ![[Jado - Jado on Azmadi _8 - L3 - A1.ogg]] ![[Jado - Jado on Azmadi _8 - L3 - A2.ogg]]

Sekhema Asala: I... suppose such a thing is possible. In recent days, I {have} met many capable Faridun who are worthy to join us.
 ![[Jado - Jado on Azmadi _8 - L4 - A1.ogg]] ![[Jado - Jado on Azmadi _8 - L4 - A2.ogg]]

Jado: Indeed. If he did complete the Trial... he may be attempting to supplant you and make a bid for {Sekhema} of {Sekhemas}.
 ![[Jado - Jado on Azmadi _8 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sekhema Asala: The {akharas} would never follow him.
 ![[Jado - Jado on Azmadi _8 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Jado: Are you absolutely certain of that?
 ![[Jado - Jado on Azmadi _8 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Sekhema Asala: Hmm... these {are} strange times...
 ![[Jado - Jado on Azmadi _8 - L8 - A1.ogg]]


## Jado on Jun Ortoi /1
Jado: We have been watching you since you helped slay Jamanra. Sometimes, a catalyst appears - an exceptional individual in a time of great need. The Godslayer was one such catalyst. Perhaps you are, as well. We can certainly hope. I will not speak for Jun. She will introduce herself... when the time is right.

## Jado on The First Barya /5
Jado: I was sent to infiltrate the {sel khari} and guard the First {Barya}. I failed, and now, I must hunt it down and retrieve it.
 ![[Jado - Jado on The First Barya _5 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Sekhema Asala: What is this 'Azmadi' trying to do with it?
 ![[Jado - Jado on The First Barya _5 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Jado: He is trying to get to Qimah before we do. He may be trying to enact the Gifting himself as some sort of claim to power. Or... he may have something darker in mind.
 ![[Jado - Jado on The First Barya _5 - L3 - A1.ogg]] ![[Jado - Jado on The First Barya _5 - L3 - A2.ogg]]

Sekhema Asala: I will not allow him to defile our traditions.
 ![[Jado - Jado on The First Barya _5 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Jado: Neither will I.
 ![[Jado - Jado on The First Barya _5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]


## Jado on Order of the Djinn /1
Jado: We are a small but dedicated group. Orphans, only. One from each culture on Wraeclast. Our leader, Jun Ortoi, has been rebuilding the Order for the last twenty years in secret. I do not know what happened two decades ago... she refuses to talk about it. All we can do is look forward. The time has come for us to fight to save this world, and we shall succeed - or die trying.

## Jado on Chronomancy /5
Jado: Azmadi possessed powers I have only seen the most gifted tale-women wield. I believe they call it 'chronomancy.' He channeled Time itself, as if it was an element to bend to his will. This power was not his own. He called out to 'Zarokh' to aid him.
 ![[Jado - Jado on Chronomancy _5 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Jado - Jado on Chronomancy _5 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Jado - Jado on Chronomancy _5 - L1 - A3.ogg]]

Sekhema Asala: Zarokh? The ancient Djinn locked in the depths of the original Trial of the {Sekhemas}?
 ![[Jado - Jado on Chronomancy _5 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Jado: I believe so. This may be part of a plan... perhaps... The First {Barya}! It is the only one left powerful enough to carry Zarokh's essence!
 ![[Jado - Jado on Chronomancy _5 - L3 - A1.ogg]] ![[Jado - Jado on Chronomancy _5 - L3 - A2.ogg]]

Sekhema Asala: He's trying to escape his punishment.
 ![[Jado - Jado on Chronomancy _5 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Jado: That might be the case... If there is indeed a plan at work, we must be careful not to play into the schemer's hands.
