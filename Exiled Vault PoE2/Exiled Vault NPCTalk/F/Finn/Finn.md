## Finn on Freythorn /3
Finn: Not everything's beans and cheese, even under Renly. I pushed to have the clanless... well, what's left of 'em... fill the ranks. To... join the clans. But that's not up to him. He can't change how people are.

Una: These trying times have brought out the best in us... but also the worst.

Finn: I'm gonna rebuild Freythorn, I am! Even though {I'm} not clanless anymore, I need to do it. I'll build that palace in the trees, the one I told you about. With {two} stocked kitchens. Just uh... well, it won't be for me anymore... It'll be for them.

## Finn on Renly /8
Finn: Gotta admit, he's done a good job.
 ![[Finn - Finn on Renly _8 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Una: In this time of struggle, Renly's the good man we need.
 ![[Finn - Finn on Renly _8 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Finn: He doesn't want to be in charge, and that's exactly why he should be.
 ![[Finn - Finn on Renly _8 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Una: I'm surprised to hear you support him so openly.
 ![[Finn - Finn on Renly _8 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Finn: I can still bend his ear now and then. It works out.
 ![[Finn - Finn on Renly _8 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Una: Is that so?
 ![[Finn - Finn on Renly _8 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Finn: Yep. Can't have people think I've gone soft... Got a reputation to uphold.
 ![[Finn - Finn on Renly _8 - L7 - A1.ogg]] ![[Finn - Finn on Renly _8 - L7 - A2.ogg]]

Una: Oh, you've got a reputation alright. No need to worry about that.
