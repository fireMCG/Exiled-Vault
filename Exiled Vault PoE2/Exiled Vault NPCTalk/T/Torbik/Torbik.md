Torbik: Amazing work, traveller! I am Torbik. And I... am in your debt. Perhaps I could interest you in a trinket or two... With a very special discount, in your honour, of course.

Torbik: Amazing work— Oh. I didn't realize I was in the presence of someone such as yourself. I have only humble trinkets, but whatever I have, I offer to you. With a very special discount, in your honour, of course.

## Torbik on Khari Crossing /1
Torbik: I've taken this route for many years. I hold some hope that the bazaar will once again become a trade hub, like it was in ancient times. But... yes, the path is not without its dangers! My treasured rhex took off into the sands... I hope he'll come back.

## Torbik on Merchant Cart /1
Torbik: Struck off on my own several years ago. It's tough, surviving the Vastiri without a caravan, but I like the freedom. Don't get me wrong, I miss home, but the expectations there were quite rigid. I'm hoping to get a cart full of worthwhile goods and haul it on down to the Karui archipelago. I hear there's water there, {everywhere}, as far as the eye can see... Ridiculous, right? I've gotta see it for myself.

## Torbik on Treasured Rhex /1
Torbik: He's a headstrong one, like me. Answers to 'Dabu.' Or, doesn't answer, as it were.
