## Tavakai on Dannig /3
Tavakai: He showed promise when he arrived on our shores. I saw the warrior within. But I will never forgive him for allowing the hunt of our sacred whale.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Dannig _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Dannig _3 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

Ranger: Dannig has deeper respect for you than you give him credit. He tried to intervene but was too late.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Dannig _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Aye, Dannig regrets that. But it weren't his fault. It were his bloody King who gave the order.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Dannig _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: The Kalguuran was not to blame. He tried to stop it. You are too quick to judge.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Dannig _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Oh, come now. The blacksmith was too late to stop that. If you'd really like, perhaps I can bring it back to life.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Dannig _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I must tell you, Sir Dannig was not to blame. He wishes he could have stopped it.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Dannig _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: Dannig has spoken to me of this. He tried to stop it... but he was too late. He regrets that it ever took place.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Dannig _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: It's not my place to care or say... but it wasn't his fault, mate. He tried to stop that from even happening.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Dannig _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: I... did not know that. Hmm. Either way, the Kalguuran monster that is Kingsmarch is too large for any one man to {fully} control.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Dannig _3 - L9 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Dannig _3 - L9 - A2.ogg]]


## Tavakai on Redemption /5
Tavakai: I am... ashamed. Somehow, I must live with my actions. The madness I felt... the fervor... We must not let that madness take hold of the world. The Karui will aid you. We shall sail the tides of war.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Redemption _5 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Redemption _5 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Redemption _5 - L1 - A3.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Redemption _5 - L1 - A4.ogg]]

Ranger: I hope those are more than just words.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Redemption _5 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: We shoulda worked together from the start.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Redemption _5 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: A new perspective is admirable. I hope it lasts.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Redemption _5 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Some lessons are hard to stomach.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Redemption _5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: We must put our differences aside. We must move forward together.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Redemption _5 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: I'm glad to hear it. We must fight as one if we are to succeed.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Redemption _5 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: If we win, then none of this'll matter.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Redemption _5 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Yes... I will pay my debt of shame until my last breath. My people stand by me. They see my heart is true. But I shall wait to learn what the ancestors make of me.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Redemption _5 - L9 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Redemption _5 - L9 - A2.ogg]]

Ranger: Forget the past. You'll fight better without it.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Redemption _5 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: That's beyond me, but I think you'll be alright.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Redemption _5 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Forgiveness is a powerful force in this tainted world.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Redemption _5 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Perhaps they won't condemn you. They don't appear hateful.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Redemption _5 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: We are often defined by our mistakes... but you are worthy of your people's forgiveness. Your ancestors will see this too. I know it.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Redemption _5 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: I'm certain they will judge you worthy.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Redemption _5 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: I'm sure they'll give you a pass.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Redemption _5 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: I hope you are right. But now, I must redeem my name by the strength of Tukohama. As promised... you have the might of the Karui alongside you.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Redemption _5 - L17 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Redemption _5 - L17 - A2.ogg]]


## Tavakai on Blood Fever /5
Tavakai: Forgive me... daughter. The fever took hold, and I... I lost my way.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Blood Fever _5 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

The Hooded One: You must not forget your mistake, Tavakai. For the coming war, we need you and your people to fight alongside us. I will use the Weapon to heal those infected here. In return, the Karui must aid us in fighting Oriana and her forces.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Blood Fever _5 - L2 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Blood Fever _5 - L2 - A2.ogg]]

Tavakai: You have my word.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Blood Fever _5 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: I don't trust you. I think we're done here.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Blood Fever _5 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: This isn't over. It's only the beginning.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Blood Fever _5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: What do you think we should do now?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Blood Fever _5 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: We should go.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Blood Fever _5 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: You will redeem yourself. But first, we must decide what is next.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Blood Fever _5 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: You will have your chance to prove the value of your word. What's our next move?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Blood Fever _5 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Just do your part. Let's go.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Blood Fever _5 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

The Hooded One: Return to Kingsmarch. We must prepare to bring the fight to Oriana. With the Weapon in hand... we must face the Beast.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Blood Fever _5 - L11 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Blood Fever _5 - L11 - A2.ogg]]


## Tavakai on Enslaved /4
Tavakai: It began with our remote tribes. They would disappear from their islands. Gone without a trace. For generations, the Eternal Empire... and the bastards of Oriath... raided the weakest of our people and took them as slaves. But where are those slavers now? Dead! And gone!
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Enslaved _4 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Enslaved _4 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Enslaved _4 - L1 - A3.ogg]]

Ranger: Even in Ogham, the Ezomytes fought to throw off the Empire's boot.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Enslaved _4 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: It's a shame the Eternals were descended from the mountainborn. They should have never left their mountain. It were the wrong path.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Enslaved _4 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: History erases us all, eventually.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Enslaved _4 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Dead's not always gone, but I see your point.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Enslaved _4 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: As they deserve. I despise this part of humanity. Past and present.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Enslaved _4 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: Good riddance.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Enslaved _4 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: And yet Trarthus lives on, long after. To hell with them Eternal bastards!
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Enslaved _4 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Long... may they burn.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Enslaved _4 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Your dark tongue does not humour me.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Enslaved _4 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Yes! A thousand times over!
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Enslaved _4 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: So, we should care about nothing? Be subjugated? Live in fear? The beauty of freedom is the essence of life.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Enslaved _4 - L12 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Enslaved _4 - L12 - A2.ogg]]

Tavakai: And look where the Empire is now...
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Enslaved _4 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: The Azmeri are not to blame for their descendants' mistakes... They must only answer for themselves.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Enslaved _4 - L14 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Enslaved _4 - L14 - A2.ogg]]

Tavakai: Yes! The only good Eternal bastard... is a dead one!
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Enslaved _4 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Now, we must rise, stronger than ever! We will not stray again from the old Way, the true Way. The Way that carried us through history. We must be strong for the world to see, so that {we} are the masters of our own destiny!
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Enslaved _4 - L16 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Enslaved _4 - L16 - A2.ogg]]


## Tavakai on Eye of Hinekora /8
Tavakai: Hmm... how do you know of this place?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Eye of Hinekora _8 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Oh! I must have mumbled a thing or two in my sleep.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Eye of Hinekora _8 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: For a moment I thought you may have taken them there...
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Eye of Hinekora _8 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: That would be a first, wouldn't it?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Eye of Hinekora _8 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Is it an issue that he already–
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Eye of Hinekora _8 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: I'd never seen anything like it. I'd love to go ba–
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Eye of Hinekora _8 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: The sinkhole there there was quite rem–
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Eye of Hinekora _8 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: What's wrong, old man? Don't want to tell him that we sailed-
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Eye of Hinekora _8 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Huh? We did travel to this Eye of Hinek-
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Eye of Hinekora _8 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: But we did go th–
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Eye of Hinekora _8 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Oh no. Definitely haven't been there. Certainly not. No place for outsiders.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Eye of Hinekora _8 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Definitely would be a first. But that's mad. Unless of course, the Ancestors approved. Then, there'd be no problem at all.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Eye of Hinekora _8 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: I suppose so. Still, I don't think it's a good idea...
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Eye of Hinekora _8 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Exactly.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Eye of Hinekora _8 - L14 - A1.ogg]]


## Tavakai on Introduction /9
Tavakai: What possessed you to break our ancestral binding? You have released {Tekaru,} the Deceiver! Now, he's free to wreak havoc on Wraeclast once more. I should take your head where you stand!
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _9 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _9 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

Makoru: You will do no such thing! How were we to know? I didn't even know about that prison, or what was held there!
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _9 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: It was the concern of Chieftains and the {hatungo,} not those who reject the Way!
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _9 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: The typical arrogance of authority. You must be the local Chieftain.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _9 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: It was? Says who, then? You?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _9 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: So, you're the Chieftain?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _9 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Oh my... a Chieftain in the flesh. What remarkable size.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _9 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Honoured Chieftain, I take it?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _9 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: So... you must be the local Chieftain.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _9 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Oh, mate, mate. I had no idea I was talking to a Chieftain!
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _9 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

: I am not your {mate}. But...
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _9 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Yes. I am Tavakai, Chieftain of the Tukohama Tribe. These waters belong to the Karui. You, along with the... {Kalguurans}... are our guests. And your welcome is already wearing thin.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _9 - L12 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _9 - L12 - A2.ogg]]

Ranger: What's done is done. I made the choice. That's on me.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _9 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: I am sorry, Chieftain. I had no idea.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _9 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Fate led me there, it was not a choice of my own.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _9 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: I knew something was wrong from the start. I just wanted to see what would happen.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _9 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: This must be made right. I will find and slay this {Tekaru.}
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _9 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: The Deceiver fooled us. There was no way to know.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _9 - L18 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: I just go where I'm pointed. Look, not to throw little Tujen under the boat, but...
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _9 - L19 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: You should have been wary. And...
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _9 - L20 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: What stupidity falls from your mouth?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _9 - L21 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: It is too late for that! Besides...
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _9 - L22 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: What? Have you hit your head?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _9 - L23 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: You're damn right it's on you.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _9 - L24 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: It is too late to be sorry.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _9 - L25 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: No excuse. He's a drunk. Not to be trusted! Besides...
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _9 - L26 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: If you weren't trespassing on our shores, it would never have happened! Consider this your first and last warning, {pakarui.}
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _9 - L27 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _9 - L27 - A2.ogg]]

Tavakai: If you weren't trespassing on our shores, it would never have happened! Consider this your first and last warning.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _9 - L28 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _9 - L28 - A2.ogg]]


## Tavakai on My Thanks /9
Tavakai: Well, it seems I owe you a debt of thanks. Old Matiki here says you were quite the hero.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on My Thanks _9 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Welcome to Ngakanu. I am Tavakai, Chieftain of the Tukohama Tribe. These shores belong to the Karui.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on My Thanks _9 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Kaimana: And I am Kaimana, Medicine Woman of the Tukohama Tribe!
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on My Thanks _9 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: And I am Matik... oh, yes we've met. Never mind.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on My Thanks _9 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: You are our guest here. And it seems we owe you a debt of thanks... Old Matiki here says you were quite the hero.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on My Thanks _9 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: It was a fight I won't soon forget! Tukohama himself would delight at what I saw you do back there!
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on My Thanks _9 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Kaimana: The waters knew Matiki was alive, yes! I told you, Tavakai. Keep looking, I said! The old coot still breathes!
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on My Thanks _9 - L7 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on My Thanks _9 - L7 - A2.ogg]]

Matiki: Hey now! I may be old... but I am wise.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on My Thanks _9 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Best not fool around offshore anymore, Matiki.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on My Thanks _9 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: The mountainborn look after their Elders too. It was my honour to return you home.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on My Thanks _9 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Perhaps you best stay here from now on, Elder.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on My Thanks _9 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Not wise enough it seems...
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on My Thanks _9 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Oh how the Tale-women back home would love you two...
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on My Thanks _9 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: I'm pleased to have returned your wisdom to where it belongs.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on My Thanks _9 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Just look after yourself, old mate.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on My Thanks _9 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: For your good deed, I will allow you to come and go from this sacred hall as you please. But no further inland. The heart of the Tukohama tribe is for our people only. You have my thanks.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on My Thanks _9 - L16 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on My Thanks _9 - L16 - A2.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on My Thanks _9 - L16 - A3.ogg]]


## Tavakai on Guests /4
Tavakai: Yes. You are all {guests} here on these waters. Waters that have belonged to us since the Beginning of Time. Our {Way} is our identity. It is beyond life and death. The Way gave us the strength to endure all the horrors of Wraeclast. Corruption. Disease. Slavers... Ugh. Never again.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Guests _4 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Guests _4 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Guests _4 - L1 - A3.ogg]]

Ranger: I grew up surrounded by that lesson. Survival of the fittest.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Guests _4 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: My tribe survived by living in harmony... but now I'm on me own, with only me own strength.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Guests _4 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: We are promised a better world. But for now, it appears violence is the only answer.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Guests _4 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Beyond life and death? Haha! Hmm... I suppose belief is a kind of strength.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Guests _4 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: The Maraketh have endured many of the same woes. All that truly matters is strength. What else ensures survival?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Guests _4 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: I understand. As a child, my back was branded by foul hands. Some of my earliest memories are of pain. I vowed never to be weak again.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Guests _4 - L7 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Guests _4 - L7 - A2.ogg]]

Mercenary: I can respect that. No one should kneel to the weak.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Guests _4 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Then my words are not wasted on you. Now... it is your choice, and you choose to be strong!
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Guests _4 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: It can take many forms, yes...
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Guests _4 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Nothing does! The Maraketh know this!
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Guests _4 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: We are promised nothing. We must make the world better for ourselves... with our own hands.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Guests _4 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: It is not enough to just survive! Why merely settle for that?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Guests _4 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Return to them! You belong to your tribe, as they do to you. The strength of the individual is nothing against the tide of many...
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Guests _4 - L14 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Guests _4 - L14 - A2.ogg]]

Tavakai: Yes... I'd sooner join the Mother of Death's embrace!
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Guests _4 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Strength is the key! And yet here we are... Slowly but surely, outsiders forsake us. The Vaal, the Eternal Empire, and now... the Kalguurans. I thought their leader, Dannig, was true of heart... until he allowed the harvest of our sacred whale! And it was all downhill from there... Twenty years ago, we allowed only four Kalguurans to stay here... and now look at this place. Ugh.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Guests _4 - L16 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Guests _4 - L16 - A2.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Guests _4 - L16 - A3.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Guests _4 - L16 - A4.ogg]]


## Tavakai on Introduction /3
Tavakai: I am Tavakai, Chieftain of the Tukohama Tribe. These waters, and all the islands within, belong to the Karui. You and these... {Kalguurans}... are our guests. I expect you to behave like it.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _3 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

Ranger: I have no issue with your people, but I'll do what I like.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: I shall treat your seas with the same respect as I do the land.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: I bow to your request, Chieftain.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Yes, tell one of the Coven to behave, see what that gets you...
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Of course, honoured Chieftain. The Karui are still considered allies where I come from.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: I know my place here. But respect must be mutual.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: What? Really? Fair enough, boss.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: I care not for your words, only your actions. I'll be watching.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _3 - L9 - A1.ogg]]


## Tavakai on Introduction /5
Tavakai: What possessed you to break our ancestral binding? You have released {Tekaru,} the Deceiver! Now, he's free to wreak havoc on Wraeclast once more. I should take your head where you stand!
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _5 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _5 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

Makoru: You will do no such thing! How were we to know? I didn't even know about that prison, or what was held there!

Tavakai: It was the concern of Chieftains and the {hatungo,} not those who reject the Way!

Ranger: What's done is done. I made the choice. That's on me.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _5 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: I am sorry, Chieftain. I had no idea.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Fate led me there, it was not a choice of my own.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _5 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: I knew something was wrong from the start. I just wanted to see what would happen.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _5 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: This must be made right. I will find and slay this {Tekaru.}

Warrior: The Deceiver fooled us. There was no way to know.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _5 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: I just go where I'm pointed. Look, not to throw little Tujen under the boat, but...
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Introduction _5 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: If you weren't trespassing on our shores, it would never have happened! Consider this your first and last warning, {pakarui.}

## Tavakai on Kanu /4
Tavakai: Kanu was always headstrong. Loud and disrespectful... all the makings of a great warrior! He threw it all away to work for the Kalguurans. We have lost many to foreign causes. That's why Ngakanu is now off limits to outsiders.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Kanu _4 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Kanu _4 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Kanu _4 - L1 - A3.ogg]]

Ranger: You can't control the young. It's wrong to try.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Kanu _4 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: The Azmeri welcome new ideas. Home cannot be a prison.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Kanu _4 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: False faith can often lead the youth astray.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Kanu _4 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Ideas can be more dangerous than any weapon.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Kanu _4 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I, too, chose to walk my own path. It really is not as easy as you think.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Kanu _4 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: Ah, I understand now.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Kanu _4 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Gotta lock the young ones down, I say. They'll end up slaves... or worse.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Kanu _4 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Yes. I expected you would.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Kanu _4 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Perhaps... but try defending yourself with an idea.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Kanu _4 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Few choices are easy. But some... are right.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Kanu _4 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Mm. They do not know, what they do not know.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Kanu _4 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: It is not about control! It's about honour. Respect. Tradition.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Kanu _4 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Perhaps that suits you, up on your mountain. But the sea moves quickly.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Kanu _4 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Yes. That is my fear. A history... we shall never relive.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Kanu _4 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: We cannot afford to lose more of our young to these {dangerous} ideas...
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Kanu _4 - L16 - A1.ogg]]


## Tavakai on Makoru /4
Tavakai: It is... disappointing... to see our young abandoning the Way and becoming... what? Workhands? For the Kalguurans? It is ridiculous! She could be so much more!
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Makoru _4 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Makoru _4 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

Ranger: {I} find her rather impressive. You should give her a chance.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Makoru _4 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Makoru is capable and skilled. I don't see the problem, meself.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Makoru _4 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Ah, but if only we had such clear insight for ourselves, the way we do for others.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Makoru _4 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: I think she's doing just fine. Makoru's the least intolerable person I've met here.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Makoru _4 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: But Chieftain, with respect, who are you to judge her path?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Makoru _4 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: She will make a name for herself, in her own way.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Makoru _4 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Hey, don't knock hired-hands. Trade's the bones of it all. Gets us soft beds, privies, and such. All the things that make life worth living.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Makoru _4 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: I am her father! So I am more than qualified!
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Makoru _4 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: She is more than capable! Which is why she belongs with us!
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Makoru _4 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: If that is all that makes your life worth living, then I pity you.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Makoru _4 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Ugh. The First Karui Captain of some outsider's fleet, is there really honour in that? I doubt it. Kanu rejected us to be a lowly ' {first mate}', as they call it. I know his father. He is deeply ashamed. The youth these days are more foolish than ever.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Makoru _4 - L12 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Makoru _4 - L12 - A2.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Makoru _4 - L12 - A3.ogg]]


## Tavakai on Ngakanu /32
Tavakai: This has been home to the Tukohama Tribe for countless generations. Though we stayed for our solemn duty, we thrived because of our love of these shores.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakanu _32 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakanu _32 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

Kaimana: The tides wash ashore, bringing life and abundance. Yes! This is our home and our tribe is an ever growing family. Together, we thrive, until Tukohama welcomes us again into his embrace.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakanu _32 - L2 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakanu _32 - L2 - A2.ogg]]

Ranger: I've never known a real {family}. All I've known is isolation. I've learned to trust only myself.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakanu _32 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Kaimana: Oh, my child! That hurts my heart to hear. But I understand you. Yes! You know the pain of silence is nothing compared to the hurt of a misplaced word from one that we adore.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakanu _32 - L4 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakanu _32 - L4 - A2.ogg]]

Ranger: That... is true.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakanu _32 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Kaimana: But closing off your heart and soul... from the world around you... that does more damage than any word can. For it is death in life. The beasts and the trees can only carry your soul so far. We need each other, child. We need connection.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakanu _32 - L6 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakanu _32 - L6 - A2.ogg]]

Ranger: I can't... I won't.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakanu _32 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Kaimana: You can. And one day, when you are ready... You will. I can see it in your eyes. When the time comes, don't be frightened. Yes! You {will} heal. I promise you.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakanu _32 - L8 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakanu _32 - L8 - A2.ogg]]

Huntress: The mountainborn are much less forgiving of each other than the Karui appear to be.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakanu _32 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Don't let our kindness blind you. There are limits. Boundaries we will maintain. The weak will not survive. And this is the brutal nature of life. We do not stand in its way.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakanu _32 - L10 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakanu _32 - L10 - A2.ogg]]

Matiki: Tukohama showed us strength. Strength {is} a kindness. Showing weakness does nothing for your community. Weakness takes many forms. Strength is truth. Strength is honour. In most cases, it is simple to tell one from the other.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakanu _32 - L11 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakanu _32 - L11 - A2.ogg]]

Huntress: Perhaps we aren't so different after all.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakanu _32 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: My sense of family and belonging is solely tied to the Dreamer. His path is all I see.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakanu _32 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: I do not know who you speak of. This... Dreamer. What do {you} know of him?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakanu _32 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: I know that he has well laid plans that will free me. Wholly. And that my potential will continue to soar under his guidance.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakanu _32 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Well.. my father once told me, Matiki, if you are to speak, make sure your words mean something. Empty words carry no message. No meaning. Consider this lesson, my friend.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakanu _32 - L16 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakanu _32 - L16 - A2.ogg]]

Witch: I'm not entirely sure how death works around here...
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakanu _32 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Kaimana: Death and honour are bound to each other. This is important, yes! If the ancestors see you, if they recognize you, then you can never truly die. Oh yes! It is part of the Way.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakanu _32 - L18 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakanu _32 - L18 - A2.ogg]]

Witch: I've no idea what you're talking about.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakanu _32 - L19 - A1.ogg]]

Kaimana: Oh come now! You must surely have seen that there is more to life and death than what it seems?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakanu _32 - L20 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Trust me, dear, I'm {very} aware of that.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakanu _32 - L21 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: We share a love of our home. The Maraketh cherish the Vastiri, even though at times... it can feel like it holds no love for us.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakanu _32 - L22 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Sand and water are not so different. The tide is not always on our side either. But we know our place in the world. We know that we owe respect to its power. I am sure the Maraketh know this of the Vastiri, mmm?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakanu _32 - L23 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakanu _32 - L23 - A2.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakanu _32 - L23 - A3.ogg]]

Sorceress: It is true. We fear the sands. And admire them. You are both wise, indeed.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakanu _32 - L24 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: It is a beautiful place. I envy this sense of timeless belonging.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakanu _32 - L25 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Listen to me now. You may come here from distant shores, but you are still connected to us. The tribes all have their own songs, their own tastes, their own Way... but we are all Karui. We are bound beyond what we see. Beyond who we think we are. And I am proud to know you.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakanu _32 - L26 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakanu _32 - L26 - A2.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakanu _32 - L26 - A3.ogg]]

Warrior: I... am touched. Thank you.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakanu _32 - L27 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: All sounds quite lovely. Where I'm from it isn't so pretty. Death means coin and is commonplace. Maybe I've gotten a bit... desensitised to it all.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakanu _32 - L28 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakanu _32 - L28 - A2.ogg]]

Kaimana: You have known love in your life. Yes! You can't hide that. Try as you may.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakanu _32 - L29 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: We can't help where we are born. Who we are born to. But... with some hard work... we can shape who we choose to become. So, who do you choose to be?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakanu _32 - L30 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakanu _32 - L30 - A2.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakanu _32 - L30 - A3.ogg]]

Mercenary: Good question.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakanu _32 - L31 - A1.ogg]]

Kaimana: Yes! And you have your whole life to answer it.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakanu _32 - L32 - A1.ogg]]


## Tavakai on Ngakuramakoi /6
Tavakai: The word represents a fighter of fierce conviction. Someone who truly embodies 'The Way'. A fighter who, when called upon, would give it all to honour 'The Way', or die trying.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakuramakoi _6 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakuramakoi _6 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

Tavakai: As you know, the word represents a fighter of fierce conviction. Someone who truly embodies 'The Way'. A fighter who, when called upon, would give it all to honour 'The Way', or die trying.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakuramakoi _6 - L2 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakuramakoi _6 - L2 - A2.ogg]]

Ranger: What informs you that someone {is} such a person?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakuramakoi _6 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: How do you find these warriors?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakuramakoi _6 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: How is this even achieved or recognised?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakuramakoi _6 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: So what qualifications are needed to fulfil that role?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakuramakoi _6 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: How does one become such a person?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakuramakoi _6 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: How can you know someone truly is a {Ngakuramakoi}?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakuramakoi _6 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: What gives it away? How do you find them?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakuramakoi _6 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: Our ancestors were all {Ngakuramakoi} in their own way, while they were alive. It is what made them special. You can feel it radiate from the person. An aura. A truth.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakuramakoi _6 - L10 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakuramakoi _6 - L10 - A2.ogg]]

Kaimana: Yes! And we believe the Ancestors choose their fighter. They bless them with passion for the tribe. And we are blessed to have Tavakai, even if he may be a little headstrong at times...
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakuramakoi _6 - L11 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakuramakoi _6 - L11 - A2.ogg]]

Tavakai: Kaimana...
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakuramakoi _6 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Kaimana: {Ati-ati!} Said with love, my Chieftain.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Ngakuramakoi _6 - L13 - A1.ogg]]


## Tavakai on Twilight Order /11
Ranger: Do you worry about the people on Arastas?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Twilight Order _11 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: What do you make of them lot on Arastas?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Twilight Order _11 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Are you concerned about this Twilight Order?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Twilight Order _11 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: What of those fanatics on Arastas?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Twilight Order _11 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Do you worry about the people of Arastas?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Twilight Order _11 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: What do you make of this Twilight Order?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Twilight Order _11 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: What you reckon about them Twilight Order folks?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Twilight Order _11 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Bah. The very name Arastas sets my teeth on edge. That is {not} our name for those ancient shores. The Twilight Order has been there in some form for a very long time. There are sacred burial sites deep within the island... but they are not Karui. Other than that, we know very little about them.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Twilight Order _11 - L8 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Twilight Order _11 - L8 - A2.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Twilight Order _11 - L8 - A3.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Twilight Order _11 - L8 - A4.ogg]]

Kaimana: Yes! But... we know enough to be concerned. Unlike the Kalguurans, the Order actively recruits any that will listen. Listen long enough, and you may pledge just to shut them up! Once you're recruited, you say goodbye to your old life. Goodbye to your family. Goodbye to yourself. It is worrisome, yes!
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Twilight Order _11 - L9 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Twilight Order _11 - L9 - A2.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Twilight Order _11 - L9 - A3.ogg]]

Matiki: We have lost many of our youth to their {cause}. They promise a new future. A new world. But... we do not know {how} they plan to achieve it. There is more to uncover about their motives.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Twilight Order _11 - L10 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Twilight Order _11 - L10 - A2.ogg]]

Tavakai: Put simply, they may soon know the meaning of the true Way. I will not console another mother, sister or child who has lost their loved one to those wretched fools, never to hear from them again.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Twilight Order _11 - L11 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Twilight Order _11 - L11 - A2.ogg]]

Ranger: If diplomacy doesn't work, I understand it.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Twilight Order _11 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Sounds like they've got it coming, if talking won't work.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Twilight Order _11 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Why not try to speak with them?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Twilight Order _11 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: No open conversation with them as of yet, I take it?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Twilight Order _11 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Have you not spoken to their elders?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Twilight Order _11 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: Have you tried speaking with them?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Twilight Order _11 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: You tried having a chat with 'em?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Twilight Order _11 - L18 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: The head of the sea serpent is hard to find in stormy seas. Their hierarchy is... confusing. Titles upon titles. It reeks of a militant structure, no matter how they try to make it look.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Twilight Order _11 - L19 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Twilight Order _11 - L19 - A2.ogg]]

Matiki: The swords give a hint or two!
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Twilight Order _11 - L20 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: We've tried talking. I'm done with it.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Twilight Order _11 - L21 - A1.ogg]]

Kaimana: And not just Tavakai. I also tried. Yes.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Twilight Order _11 - L22 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: And me too. All I got out of it was about half a day of listening to nonsense that went in one ear... and out the other. I think {they} might not even know what they are going on about. They {do} make a good mead, though...
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Twilight Order _11 - L23 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Twilight Order _11 - L23 - A2.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Twilight Order _11 - L23 - A3.ogg]]


## Tavakai on Tekaru /7
Tavakai: Tukohama tasked his tribe— {my} tribe—with keeping that Deceiver in his prison. Our sacred duty kept us in this region, even though we longed for the sea... but it is good that we stayed.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Tekaru _7 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Tekaru _7 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

Ranger: It was foolish to not have further protections.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Tekaru _7 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: I feel guilty for my trespass and for doing what I did. But I didn't know.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Tekaru _7 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Ah, so it was your job to keep him there.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Tekaru _7 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Chieftain I must say... it seemed a little too easy to set him free...
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Tekaru _7 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Such a powerful being, left out in the open? I cannot comprehend how this has happened.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Tekaru _7 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: Why was he not guarded further?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Tekaru _7 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: I've seen better security in a Korathin pleasure den.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Tekaru _7 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Best you mind your mouth.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Tekaru _7 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: That is no excuse.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Tekaru _7 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Yes. It is what has kept our people here for so many generations.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Tekaru _7 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: All thanks to you and these damn Kalguurans...
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Tekaru _7 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Capturing him was a miracle in itself... it was then impossible to move him.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Tekaru _7 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: That binding... had stood the test of time.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Tekaru _7 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: I don't want to know what that means...
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Tekaru _7 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: We tried posting warriors to keep watch over the prison. He'd drive them mad. They'd throw themselves into the sea. Instead, we allowed his fog to wreak its havoc and in turn... keep him hidden. Besides... I had no idea Kalguuran runes could undo our ancestral binding. Yet another reason for us to not get along.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Tekaru _7 - L16 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Tekaru _7 - L16 - A2.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Tekaru _7 - L16 - A3.ogg]]

Ranger: As I've said... what's done is done.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Tekaru _7 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: It's remarkable you kept him there this whole time.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Tekaru _7 - L18 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: In time, he will not be of any concern.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Tekaru _7 - L19 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Well, can't do much about it now, can we?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Tekaru _7 - L20 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Please forgive me. It is a regrettable situation. I did not mean harm.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Tekaru _7 - L21 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: It was an unfortunate series of mistakes.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Tekaru _7 - L22 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Well, least you lot are free of worrying if he's still there, I guess.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Tekaru _7 - L23 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Well, least you lot are free of worrying if he's still there, I guess.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Tekaru _7 - L24 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: For untold generations, he slept soundly in that prison. But the Deceiver woke from his slumber twenty years ago, and has been causing more and more problems ever since. The fog... crashing ships... foul dreams... cursed voices... Even one of our Elders fell for his lies, and went missing. But it will be much worse now that the Deceiver is free, thanks to you.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Tekaru _7 - L25 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Tekaru _7 - L25 - A2.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Tekaru _7 - L25 - A3.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Tekaru _7 - L25 - A4.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Tekaru _7 - L25 - A5.ogg]]

Tavakai: For untold generations, he slept soundly in that prison. But the Deceiver woke from his slumber twenty years ago, and has been causing more and more problems ever since. The fog... crashing ships... foul dreams... cursed voices... Even Matiki, the Elder you found, was deceived and led astray by Tekaru's lies. It will be much worse now that the Deceiver is free, thanks to you.

## Tavakai on The Beast /8
Tavakai: Of course we know of the Beast. Every culture on Wraeclast knows of the Beast. It kept the gods asleep. Tekaru in his slumber. But the Corruption... the Blood Fever... this price is too heavy to pay.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on The Beast _8 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on The Beast _8 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

Kaimana: Divinity... and Corruption... yes! Both unnatural curses upon the world. Think about how simple things would be without them. But, a mystic knows, what's simple isn't always true.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on The Beast _8 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Matiki: There is always something to cause suffering in the world. Good intentions or not. Until the day bloodlust overtakes us, we shall try our best to maintain balance.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on The Beast _8 - L3 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on The Beast _8 - L3 - A2.ogg]]

Ranger: Speak more of this bloodlust.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on The Beast _8 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: What do you mean by that?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on The Beast _8 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: What of this bloodlust you mention?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on The Beast _8 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: You got my attention with that last bit... care to elaborate?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on The Beast _8 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Bloodlust... this sounds a worrisome tale.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on The Beast _8 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: What bloodlust do you speak of?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on The Beast _8 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Hang on... what was that bit about bloodlust overtaking us?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on The Beast _8 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: The tribes all have their own 'end of time' stories. Ours follows the one true {Ngakuramakoi.} Through no fault of their own, this warrior will inspire the entire world to war. A war to end all. And, the {Ngakuramakoi} will fall in that war.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on The Beast _8 - L11 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on The Beast _8 - L11 - A2.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on The Beast _8 - L11 - A3.ogg]]

Kaimana: Yes! And his corpse... his corpse shall be where the seed of a new day is sown. A time when all can be strong.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on The Beast _8 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Sounds quite ridiculous. But... do you believe {you} are this person?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on The Beast _8 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Spirit save me. What a tale. So you believe you are the {Ngakuramakoi}?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on The Beast _8 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: And are you the one to bring this doom?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on The Beast _8 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Well, mighty Chieftain... are you the world ender?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on The Beast _8 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: So... am I speaking to this {Ngakuramakoi?}
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on The Beast _8 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: Wait. You think this person is Tavakai?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on The Beast _8 - L18 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Shite. Better get my affairs in order, eh? So, are you that fella?

Tavakai: Who is to say? It is not my place to know or to guess. I do not even really care. If I am, so be it. If not, I will still do what is right for my people. Whatever that may be.

## Tavakai on The Way /4
Tavakai: Long ago, Tukohama put axes in our hands and taught us to fight. {That} is the most important lesson of our Way. We were nothing before we were given strength.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on The Way _4 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: It makes sense to me.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on The Way _4 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: This 'Tukohama'... I like the sound of him.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on The Way _4 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: You believe you couldn't fight before Tukohama taught you? Curious.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on The Way _4 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Tukohama is dead, isn't he?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on The Way _4 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Strength is vital to overcoming our own weaknesses. It is true.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on The Way _4 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: Tukohama seems to have taught you well.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on The Way _4 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Yeah, mate. Strong is good. Agreed.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on The Way _4 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Show some respect, will you?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on The Way _4 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Could someone think before they had a brain? It is obvious.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on The Way _4 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Had we been united in our strength, perhaps history would have told a different tale. Now, the tribes must stand together and put the Karui first. We will always have neighbours, but they must acknowledge our strength. And one way, or another... they shall.

## Tavakai on Tribes /6
Tavakai: We gather from time to time. Not as often as we should. But it usually always becomes some sort of... altercation. Some of us just have very different ideas.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Tribes _6 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Tribes _6 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

Matiki: It is our differences that make us stronger.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Tribes _6 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Perhaps. But... there must be someone who carries the truth.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Tribes _6 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Why are you so confident in {your} interpretation?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Tribes _6 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: But Tavakai... how do you know you're right?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Tribes _6 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: What makes you so sure in your belief?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Tribes _6 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: And what makes you so sure, in all your arrogance, that yours is the right {Way?}
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Tribes _6 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: How do you know that your truth is the truth for all Karui?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Tribes _6 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: How do you know that {your} version of The Way is true?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Tribes _6 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: What makes you bet it all on what you believe?
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Tribes _6 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Hmm... it is not your business, but I will share this with you. I appealed to Tukohama. To all the Ancestors. I asked them for guidance. Tukohama heard me. His presence rumbled the very earth. And my axe... it glowed against the night, filled with his strength. It was a reminder of what he taught us so long ago.

Tavakai: A good question. I appealed to Tukohama. To all the Ancestors. I asked them for guidance. Tukohama heard me. His presence rumbled the very earth. And my axe... it glowed against the night, filled with his strength. It was a reminder of what he taught us so long ago.

Matiki: We have not known the Ancestors to reveal their Will to us in such a way for a very long time. Tavakai is our true {Ngakuramakoi.} Where he leads, we will follow without question. It is only a matter of time before the other tribes recognise his strength.

## Tavakai on Your Mission /5
Tavakai: Well then... what is it that brings you here? You've clearly made yourself at home on our waters.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Your Mission _5 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Your Mission _5 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

Ranger: I don't know that it's any of your business, but I suppose we're on the same side. I'm looking for pieces of an ancient Weapon that can supposedly defeat Corruption.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Your Mission _5 - L2 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Your Mission _5 - L2 - A2.ogg]]

Huntress: I seek an answer to the {rathin}. To that end, I'm lookin' for pieces of an ancient Weapon.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Your Mission _5 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: The Dreamer wills that I seek out pieces of an ancient Weapon against Corruption.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Your Mission _5 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: I'm just here on a lark, really. Or looking for parts of an ancient Weapon that can destroy Corruption. One of those two.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Your Mission _5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I am on a mission to find and rebuild an ancient Weapon. A Weapon that may help us destroy Corruption.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Your Mission _5 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: I seek pieces of an ancient Weapon against Corruption.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Your Mission _5 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: I'm on a quest, boss. Looking for pieces of an ancient Weapon that I can use to take down Corruption.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Your Mission _5 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: Hmm. Our islands have become more and more {sickened} of late. Those who stray, fall ill with the Blood Fever, and are cast out to die alone. My {hatungo} worries that the Beast has returned to the world once more.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Your Mission _5 - L9 - A1.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Your Mission _5 - L9 - A2.ogg]] ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Your Mission _5 - L9 - A3.ogg]]

Ranger: Your {hatungo} is right. I need that Weapon to drain and remove Corruption.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Your Mission _5 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Your {hatungo} sure is wise. That Weapon can drain and remove {rathin}. It's our only chance to destroy the Beast.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Your Mission _5 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: It has returned, indeed. That is why humanity needs the Weapon - to drain and remove Corruption.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Your Mission _5 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Oh, it {has.} That's what the Weapon is for... to drain and remove Corruption.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Your Mission _5 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: The Beast has indeed returned... and the Maraketh are on the move once again. I need the Weapon to drain and remove Corruption.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Your Mission _5 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: It has. That's why we need the Weapon... to drain and remove Corruption.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Your Mission _5 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: That's spot on. It's why I need the Weapon. To drain and remove Corruption.
 ![[Tavakai - Tavakai on Your Mission _5 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Tavakai: This Weapon... it sounds like it could cure the Blood Fever. We believe it is caused by Corruption contaminating our very blood, so removing it may heal that sickness. Hmmm... a powerful Weapon indeed... I suppose I can allow you to continue your search, for now. We will not interfere with your passage on our waters... but you best remain respectful.
