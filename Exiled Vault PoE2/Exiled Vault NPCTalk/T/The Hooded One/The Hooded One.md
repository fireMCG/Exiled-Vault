## The Hooded One on The Weapon /1
The Hooded One: The Weapon is radiating intense Corruption... It will sicken and madden all those who near it... Quickly... he has returned to Ngakanu... You must stop him!

## The Hooded One on Doryani /14
The Hooded One: Doryani sees the world through a different lens. We must remember that he is of a bygone era...
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Doryani _14 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: ... I can hear you, you know.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Doryani _14 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

The Hooded One: Indeed.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Doryani _14 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: And of what era are you, exactly?
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Doryani _14 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

The Hooded One: Older still. I have seen many civilisations rise and fall.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Doryani _14 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: We all have our differences.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Doryani _14 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Yes... fight!
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Doryani _14 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Must I listen to squabble?
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Doryani _14 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: You are both equally questionable.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Doryani _14 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Hey now... Break it up.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Doryani _14 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Please. We must remain calm.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Doryani _14 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Heh. I'd pay money to watch you two brawl it out.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Doryani _14 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

The Hooded One: It is a strange feeling, meeting someone so gifted in sciences I unintentionally brought to the world. All of Vaal technology and advancements, derived from my ultimate mistake...
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Doryani _14 - L13 - A1.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Doryani _14 - L13 - A2.ogg]]

Doryani: You call the Beast a mistake? On this, I do not agree. The gods were nothing but monstrous tyrants. The power of Corruption allowed humanity to seize back control of their destiny!
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Doryani _14 - L14 - A1.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Doryani _14 - L14 - A2.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Doryani _14 - L14 - A3.ogg]]

The Hooded One: And what did you do with that control? In your experiments, I saw death. Dismemberment. A living nightmare.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Doryani _14 - L15 - A1.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Doryani _14 - L15 - A2.ogg]]

Doryani: A means to an end. They were all willing sacrifices.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Doryani _14 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

The Hooded One: That is, somehow, even more frightening. The zealotry. The fervor. I've seen it all too often... a kind of madness, seemingly fundamental to mankind.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Doryani _14 - L17 - A1.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Doryani _14 - L17 - A2.ogg]]

Doryani: Perhaps, but it was their choice to make. They gave themselves in the hopes of saving our people. My only regret is that I failed.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Doryani _14 - L18 - A1.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Doryani _14 - L18 - A2.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Doryani _14 - L18 - A3.ogg]]

The Hooded One: Oh to bear but {one} regret...
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Doryani _14 - L19 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: One day, all regrets will be cast aside. We will put things right.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Doryani _14 - L20 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: And this is what I get for trying to make small talk.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Doryani _14 - L21 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Regrets are what shape us. Learnings observed about ourselves. No one is perfect.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Doryani _14 - L22 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Regrets are useless. We have to move forward. Best you both try to as well.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Doryani _14 - L23 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: I've certainly made some mistakes I wish I could take back. But we must accept them and move on.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Doryani _14 - L24 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: The burdened mind drags itself down. The past is behind us.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Doryani _14 - L25 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Oof, sorry I asked.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Doryani _14 - L26 - A1.ogg]]


## The Hooded One on Allies /5
The Hooded One: Now, we need allies. I believe we have earned good will throughout Wraeclast. It is time to call upon those debts. One last journey, recruiting any who will join us, before we assault Oriath. The Karui are already with us. We should call upon the Ezomytes and the Maraketh.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Allies _5 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Allies _5 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Allies _5 - L1 - A3.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Allies _5 - L1 - A4.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Allies _5 - L1 - A5.ogg]]

Doryani: As it so happens, I may... also have some forces in reserve.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Allies _5 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: Forces in reserve? You mean {living} Vaal?
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Allies _5 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Where would you be hiding something like that?
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Allies _5 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: You have {living} warriors? Where?
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Allies _5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: What? Living Vaal? How?
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Allies _5 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Really? Where might they be?
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Allies _5 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: What does {that} mean?
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Allies _5 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: You're a tricky one, aren't ya, mate?
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Allies _5 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: Suffice to say, I've always got a contingency plan.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Allies _5 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

The Hooded One: On we go, then, to build an alliance against the end.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Allies _5 - L11 - A1.ogg]]


## The Hooded One on Unity /3
The Hooded One: It has been thousands of years since I've seen an alliance such as this. Wraeclast has finally united the way I always hoped it would. Come, let us plan our assault on Oriath.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Unity _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Unity _3 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Unity _3 - L1 - A3.ogg]]

Doryani: I've been working on a strategy of sorts.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Unity _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: Let's hope it's a good one this time...
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Unity _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: That's good. For once, I don't think blasting my way in will work.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Unity _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Indeed, the time of heroes is upon us once more.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Unity _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: I'm ready. Let's end this.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Unity _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: The final rush of the hunt.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Unity _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: The end is nigh, one way or another.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Unity _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: I'm glad you're with us, boss.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Unity _3 - L9 - A1.ogg]]


## The Hooded One on First Weapon Piece /8
The Hooded One: This piece of the Weapon... it has writing on it...
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on First Weapon Piece _8 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: The first example of Precursor writing I've ever seen!
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on First Weapon Piece _8 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

The Hooded One: I... recognise some of these symbols...
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on First Weapon Piece _8 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: What? How?
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on First Weapon Piece _8 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

The Hooded One: When I was very young, but a boy, and still mortal... hmm. Such a faded memory... I was... in her lap... and symbols like these, decorated a vivid book... I can almost hear her saying the words... what they mean...
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on First Weapon Piece _8 - L5 - A1.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on First Weapon Piece _8 - L5 - A2.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on First Weapon Piece _8 - L5 - A3.ogg]]

Warrior: Who was this person?
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on First Weapon Piece _8 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Are you saying what I think you're saying?
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on First Weapon Piece _8 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Please. You must recall. What do they mean?
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on First Weapon Piece _8 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: What's happening? What do you remember?
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on First Weapon Piece _8 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: What's goin' on?
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on First Weapon Piece _8 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Clear your mind. Try to recall. What do they mean?
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on First Weapon Piece _8 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: What are you saying, old fella?
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on First Weapon Piece _8 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

The Hooded One: I'm not sure... I have to think on it... I have to try to remember...
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on First Weapon Piece _8 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: Then {we} must find the other pieces. We need more information.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on First Weapon Piece _8 - L14 - A1.ogg]]


## The Hooded One on Oriana /5
Warrior: Oriana... Ogham's downfall... was part of the Twilight Order all along! Greatwolf ravage her!
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Oriana _5 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: So, the Twilight Order and Oriana are one and the same. Who knew?
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Oriana _5 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: It makes sense. Oriana is part of this Twilight Order.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Oriana _5 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Oriana's working for the Twilight Order. First Ogham, then the Vastiri... now the world.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Oriana _5 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Oriana and the Twilight Order... she's got a lot to answer for.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Oriana _5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Oriana is behind the Twilight Order. Pulling its strings.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Oriana _5 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Count Geonor's missus is the leader of the Twilight Order! What a bloody twist!
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Oriana _5 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

The Hooded One: We should have known. Their goals were in alignment. It's obvious, in retrospect.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Oriana _5 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: We had centuries of science at our disposal... and still we could not control the Beast. These religious fools are going to cause another Cataclysm.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Oriana _5 - L9 - A1.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Oriana _5 - L9 - A2.ogg]]

The Hooded One: We must find them. We must make them see reason!
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Oriana _5 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: I was the most reasonable man of my era, and until my hand was forced, I didn't listen. I suspect... they won't, either.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Oriana _5 - L11 - A1.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Oriana _5 - L11 - A2.ogg]]


## The Hooded One on The Twilight Order /3
The Hooded One: I thought I could deal with the gods single-handedly, without consequence. It should always have been a communal choice. I applaud them for their efforts.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Twilight Order _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Twilight Order _3 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

Doryani: It seems they despise the gods. I dare say, it is understandable. Mankind has no need of divine tyrants.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Twilight Order _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Twilight Order _3 - L2 - A2.ogg]]

Warrior: I wonder if the Order {could} be of some aid to us. They have the numbers.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Twilight Order _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: I find those overly-happy types truly unsettling... leave them to it, I say.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Twilight Order _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: The gods are not inherently evil. We have seen them do great things for the Vastiri and our people.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Twilight Order _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: I don't trust this 'Twilight Order.' Keep your beliefs to yourself, I say.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Twilight Order _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Gods derived from mankind are flawed. The Spirit... is beyond all of that.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Twilight Order _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: We cannot fathom the weight of such a thing... to be divine.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Twilight Order _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Either way, them lot on Arastas... they feel a bit off.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Twilight Order _3 - L9 - A1.ogg]]


## The Hooded One on The Third Edict /3
The Hooded One: There is no doubt now in my mind. It {is} the Weapon I saw in that third mural. The forging revealed an inscription. The symbols declare it 'The instrument of the Third Edict.' It was designed for the sole purpose of cleansing Corruption... ... and destroying the Beast.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Third Edict _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Third Edict _3 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Third Edict _3 - L1 - A3.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Third Edict _3 - L1 - A4.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Third Edict _3 - L1 - A5.ogg]]

Doryani: The Third Edict? What is the meaning... of these Edicts? Perhaps it follows that the Seed was the instrument of a {Second} Edict... But why? What part of this tale are we missing? Why would any civilisation intentionally create the Seed of Corruption?
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Third Edict _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Third Edict _3 - L2 - A2.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Third Edict _3 - L2 - A3.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Third Edict _3 - L2 - A4.ogg]]

Warrior: A question lost to time. All we can do now is destroy it.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Third Edict _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: The pursuit of power, obviously. Now, we have to clean up their mess.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Third Edict _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: They must have had a good reason... but we have no choice. We must destroy the Beast.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Third Edict _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: The hubris of man never changes. Just look at history.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Third Edict _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: You can fuss over that. We have the Weapon. The hunt is on.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Third Edict _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: The truth may come to us in time. Until then, we have what we need.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Third Edict _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: That's above my pay grade. Let's go destroy the Beast and be done with it.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Third Edict _3 - L9 - A1.ogg]]


## The Hooded One on Second Weapon Piece /5
The Hooded One: This piece has writing, too! I have some sense of the meaning...
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Second Weapon Piece _5 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: Give me everything you recall, no matter how insignificant. We must try to translate them.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Second Weapon Piece _5 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: What does it mean to you? Do you remember?
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Second Weapon Piece _5 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Something very strange is going on here... explain!
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Second Weapon Piece _5 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: There must be a tale, locked in the back of your mind. Focus on it.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Second Weapon Piece _5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Do you know why, yet? Why they seem familiar to you?
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Second Weapon Piece _5 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Some mysteries are best left untouched, you know.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Second Weapon Piece _5 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: We are stumbling upon some sort of hidden truth here.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Second Weapon Piece _5 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Oh boy. This is gettin' good.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Second Weapon Piece _5 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

The Hooded One: As a child, I was sent to live among the Azmeri with my brother and sister... But before that, I lived... {somewhere else...} Somewhere with great works of stone and metal and glass... And a kind, smiling face... a woman's face... I haven't thought about this in thousands of years... it's a mortal memory, faded to static...
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Second Weapon Piece _5 - L10 - A1.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Second Weapon Piece _5 - L10 - A2.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Second Weapon Piece _5 - L10 - A3.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Second Weapon Piece _5 - L10 - A4.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Second Weapon Piece _5 - L10 - A5.ogg]]

Doryani: Don't get distracted. Keep the thought in your mind. You must find the last piece. Now go. We will work on this.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Second Weapon Piece _5 - L11 - A1.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Second Weapon Piece _5 - L11 - A2.ogg]]


## The Hooded One on Third Weapon Piece /6
The Hooded One: The final piece... these symbols...
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Third Weapon Piece _6 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: The translation work we've done... is it enough?
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Third Weapon Piece _6 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

The Hooded One: Something about a forge... This part says 'You must finish it,' or something like it. 'You must forge it.' The word forge is drawn like a name. It's not an action. It's a place.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Third Weapon Piece _6 - L3 - A1.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Third Weapon Piece _6 - L3 - A2.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Third Weapon Piece _6 - L3 - A3.ogg]]

Doryani: So, we must find an ancient Precursor forge.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Third Weapon Piece _6 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: But where? It could be anywhere.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Third Weapon Piece _6 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: And how are we supposed to do that then?
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Third Weapon Piece _6 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: A forge? How do we find it?
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Third Weapon Piece _6 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Do we have a trail? Where do we start looking?
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Third Weapon Piece _6 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: I've hunted many things... never a forge. Where do we look?
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Third Weapon Piece _6 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: A forge? Where are we to start looking?
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Third Weapon Piece _6 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: What! How do we do that?
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Third Weapon Piece _6 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: This is the first time in my life I'm forced to admit - I have no idea. Ask the crew perhaps. The Karui. They live here, after all.

## The Hooded One on Travel to Oriath /2
The Hooded One: The time has come. We can only hope our alliance will be enough. That fateful hour... a return to Oriath. We can set sail immediately.

Warrior: How far we've come... and now, to war.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Travel to Oriath _2 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Oriath. How I've always wanted to see that fell city from the inside.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Travel to Oriath _2 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Let us show the world that we will not allow it to be destroyed!
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Travel to Oriath _2 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: I feel calm. And dread. All at once.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Travel to Oriath _2 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Spirit guide me.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Travel to Oriath _2 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: The Dreamer leads and I follow.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Travel to Oriath _2 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Lock n' load.

## The Hooded One on Tukohama Tribe /5
The Hooded One: I am glad the Tukohama Tribe still thrives. In the early days, Tukohama was a good man.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Tukohama Tribe _5 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Tukohama Tribe _5 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

Doryani: You... knew him?!
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Tukohama Tribe _5 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

The Hooded One: Yes... and I also helped kill him, too. Much to my regret.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Tukohama Tribe _5 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: It's true, then? The tales of the Godslayer, in decades past...
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Tukohama Tribe _5 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: So you really did rampage with the Godslayer?
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Tukohama Tribe _5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: The tales are true! You journeyed with the Godslayer?
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Tukohama Tribe _5 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: So, the Godslayer really existed.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Tukohama Tribe _5 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: The stories of the Godslayer are true?
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Tukohama Tribe _5 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Ah, so the Godslayer was indeed real.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Tukohama Tribe _5 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Oh, so the Godslayer wasn't just a tavern tale after all.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Tukohama Tribe _5 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

The Hooded One: Yes... at the time, there was no other way... There is one consolation... his spark was not lost...
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Tukohama Tribe _5 - L11 - A1.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Tukohama Tribe _5 - L11 - A2.ogg]]


## The Hooded One on The Weapon /5
The Hooded One: The more I consider it, the more I believe I've seen a depiction of the Weapon. Especially now that I can study the piece in Doryani's possession...
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Weapon _5 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Weapon _5 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

Doryani: A depiction? Where? The scraps I know, I learned from incredibly ancient ruins.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Weapon _5 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

The Hooded One: Yes... when I consulted the ancient being Kalandra, she told me where to find the Seed of Corruption... She was cryptic, and said that it already belonged to me. That it always had. I can still only guess what she meant... In the ruins where the Seed was sealed, I saw carvings on the wall. It was a message, left for anyone who might follow in the eons to come. A series of giant murals. The first was broken, but the second depicted the creation of the Seed. The third mural portrayed the Seed's destruction. At the time, I thought it was a warning. Now, I see the Weapon was depicted quite literally, being driven into the Seed. It might not have been a warning. It might have been... {instructions.}
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Weapon _5 - L3 - A1.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Weapon _5 - L3 - A2.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Weapon _5 - L3 - A3.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Weapon _5 - L3 - A4.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Weapon _5 - L3 - A5.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Weapon _5 - L3 - A6.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Weapon _5 - L3 - A7.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Weapon _5 - L3 - A8.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Weapon _5 - L3 - A9.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Weapon _5 - L3 - A10.ogg]]

Doryani: This confirms my hypothesis. The Weapon is the key to destroying the Beast. We must find and reassemble it, no matter the cost.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Weapon _5 - L4 - A1.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Weapon _5 - L4 - A2.ogg]]

Warrior: I will do whatever it takes.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Weapon _5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Leave it to me.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Weapon _5 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I am honour-bound to do this, but I would still volunteer.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Weapon _5 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: If it's the only way to save the lands I love, I will give my all.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Weapon _5 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: I will give my very life, if I must.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Weapon _5 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: We will succeed. Together.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Weapon _5 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Least we've got a plan.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Weapon _5 - L11 - A1.ogg]]


## The Hooded One on The Weapon /7
The Hooded One: It is curious that the Weapon was broken into pieces and dispersed here.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Weapon _7 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: From what I've seen, I don't believe the Weapon was broken apart. It was never fully completed at all. I have only ever seen it portrayed in pieces. The third mural, the one you saw, {must} have been an instruction. It is my belief that the creators of the Weapon were... interrupted.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Weapon _7 - L2 - A1.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Weapon _7 - L2 - A2.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Weapon _7 - L2 - A3.ogg]]

Warrior: Interrupted? How?
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Weapon _7 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Ooh that sounds ominous! What do you think happened?
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Weapon _7 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Let me guess, did something destroy them?
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Weapon _7 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: What befell them?
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Weapon _7 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Sounds a nice way of putting it...
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Weapon _7 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Do you know their fate?
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Weapon _7 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Interrupted? By what then?
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Weapon _7 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: It's impossible to know for certain. They were wiped out thousands of years before my time. Do... {you} have any notion?
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Weapon _7 - L10 - A1.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Weapon _7 - L10 - A2.ogg]]

The Hooded One: I was too young to remember much. I was among the Azmeri when it happened. But they did tell stories... I recall tales of... a great fire, a great wasting...
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Weapon _7 - L11 - A1.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Weapon _7 - L11 - A2.ogg]]

Doryani: {You} were alive for {that?} The historical record... it's always been conjecture...!
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Weapon _7 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

The Hooded One: I remember fear. I remember sorrow. But the Azmeri had chosen their homes carefully. They were separatists. They rejected technology. And in the end, they were right...
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Weapon _7 - L13 - A1.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Weapon _7 - L13 - A2.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Weapon _7 - L13 - A3.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Weapon _7 - L13 - A4.ogg]]


## The Hooded One on Kulemak /4
Warrior: My mind... I see... I hear...
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Kulemak _4 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Ooh... that's a neat trick.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Kulemak _4 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: It's like a tale being told in my mind...
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Kulemak _4 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: What did you just do?!
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Kulemak _4 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: So many voices...
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Kulemak _4 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: I've felt this sensation before.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Kulemak _4 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: That's a hookah hit and a half. Whew!
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Kulemak _4 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

The Hooded One: You now possess understanding of their language. Tread carefully. In ages past, these creatures served a dark god... Kulemak, the Lich Lord, master of Undeath. The alliance destroyed his body in battle countless times, but the Well of Souls remained beyond our reach.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Kulemak _4 - L8 - A1.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Kulemak _4 - L8 - A2.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Kulemak _4 - L8 - A3.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Kulemak _4 - L8 - A4.ogg]]

The Hooded One: I must go. I cannot risk capture.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Kulemak _4 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

The Hooded One: I must go. I cannot risk capture.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Kulemak _4 - L10 - A1.ogg]]


## The Hooded One on The Lightless /4
The Hooded One: So the ancient enemy has returned! Hmmm... but why is this one not attacking us?
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Lightless _4 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Lightless _4 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

Lurking Creature: The Thief of Virtue! Stealer of Kulemak's spark!
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Lightless _4 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: What's it saying?
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Lightless _4 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: This language... it was in some of the forbidden tomes.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Lightless _4 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Step back, vile wretch!
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Lightless _4 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Do you understand me, creature?
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Lightless _4 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: What's it saying? Evil dreams whisper like that...
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Lightless _4 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Greetings... friend. I don't understand you.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Lightless _4 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: I can't understand a bloody word it says.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Lightless _4 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

The Hooded One: In a time long past, I aided an alliance that fought these beings for centuries. They are the Lightless. The Abyssals. The spawn of the Well of Souls. I can teach you its ancient tongue, for knowledge was our greatest weapon. Hold still.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Lightless _4 - L10 - A1.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Lightless _4 - L10 - A2.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Lightless _4 - L10 - A3.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Lightless _4 - L10 - A4.ogg]]


## The Hooded One on Follow the Beast's trail /1
The Hooded One: The trail of Corruption leads east, so east we shall go. It seems fate conspires to return me to the Plains of Vastiri...
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Follow the Beast's trail _1 - L1 - A1.ogg]]


## The Hooded One on The Ezomytes /1
The Hooded One: We must leave this place. It is best the Ezomytes come with us. If we survive what is coming, we will return here with force, and face the origin of this Nameless threat... But for now, we must away.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Ezomytes _1 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Ezomytes _1 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Ezomytes _1 - L1 - A3.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Ezomytes _1 - L1 - A4.ogg]]


## The Hooded One on Dark Forces /1
The Hooded One: There is something very wrong in these lands. It is not Corruption... it is something far older, far darker... I must search my memories... give me time...
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Dark Forces _1 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Dark Forces _1 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Dark Forces _1 - L1 - A3.ogg]]


## The Hooded One on Memories /1
The Hooded One: The longer one lives, the heavier the weight of time. I must cast myself into the realm within, seeking states of mind, seeking the man I was in a given era. Despair has taken my poetry from me. In my divine youth, I was quite the passionate soul. And in that era, we fought for the light...
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Memories _1 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Memories _1 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Memories _1 - L1 - A3.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Memories _1 - L1 - A4.ogg]]

## The Hooded One on Khari Bazaar /1
The Hooded One: I can still see this place, as it was. There was so much life. Colour. Noise. Children playing in that fountain. Merchants selling wares. Nothing but dust and wind, now...
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Khari Bazaar _1 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Khari Bazaar _1 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Khari Bazaar _1 - L1 - A3.ogg]]


## The Hooded One on Zarokh /1
The Hooded One: I have long considered it a mistake to bind souls to {baryas}. Not only is the punishment egregious, but it allows them to persist long past their time. Zarokh achieved many great things during the war against the Abyssals, but his ambition outgrew his sense. Now, he remains to torment us, when he should have passed from this world long ago. He worked closely with the tale-women of the era, and stole their wisdom, becoming the first Chronomancer. If he has lent his powers to Azmadi, this will not be a simple contest of strength. It will be far more dangerous than that.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Zarokh _1 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Zarokh _1 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Zarokh _1 - L1 - A3.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Zarokh _1 - L1 - A4.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Zarokh _1 - L1 - A5.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Zarokh _1 - L1 - A6.ogg]]


## The Hooded One on The Cuachic /1
The Hooded One: The Cuachic may have joined our cause, but that will last only as long as we share a common enemy. Be wary. If we do manage to stop the Twilight Order and slay the Beast... we may suddenly have more to worry about.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Cuachic _1 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on The Cuachic _1 - L1 - A2.ogg]]


## The Hooded One on Doryani's Contingency /1
The Hooded One: Just between us, the existence of this 'Cuachic Vault' gives me pause. How many other plans does Doryani have in motion? Keep your eyes open.
 ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Doryani's Contingency _1 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Doryani's Contingency _1 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[The Hooded One - The Hooded One on Doryani's Contingency _1 - L1 - A3.ogg]]


## The Hooded One on Doryani /1
The Hooded One: I am struggling to reconcile two men. One is history's greatest monster, maligned across Wraeclast's written and oral traditions. The other is the man we brought back from the past, one who portrays himself as desperately trying to save his people. Are they one and the same? He accepts responsibility for the things he has done, claiming they were necessary. I suppose I have no moral high ground to stand on... Doryani could not have done any of what he did if I had not grown the Beast...
