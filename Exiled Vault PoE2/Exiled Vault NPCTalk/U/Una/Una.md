## Una on Blackwood /4
Una: We call it the Blackwood now because it is overrun by darkness. It was once a beautiful forest known to us as the Beltimber, but now, we dare not go there. The sun never reaches the forest floor, and cultists have made it their home.

Finn: It's the same sort of darkness we saw in Freythorn. The whispering, creeping, lurking shite, that killed all my friends.
 ![[Una - Una on Blackwood _4 - L2 - A1.ogg]] ![[Una - Una on Blackwood _4 - L2 - A2.ogg]]

Una: It's alright. You've got a new family now.
 ![[Una - Una on Blackwood _4 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Finn: Yeah... I do.
 ![[Una - Una on Blackwood _4 - L4 - A1.ogg]]


## Una on Darkness /5
Una: The darkness creeping across our lands is some remnant of Corruption... The being that whispers from beyond... it's an opportunist.
 ![[Una - Una on Darkness _5 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Una - Una on Darkness _5 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

Finn: Kickin' us while we're down. We saw this coming, too. Saw them take hold of Freythorn.
 ![[Una - Una on Darkness _5 - L2 - A1.ogg]] ![[Una - Una on Darkness _5 - L2 - A2.ogg]]

Una: What scares me the most? The cultists... they're not insane. They {choose} to follow the King in the Mists. They're not mad. They're fanatics.
 ![[Una - Una on Darkness _5 - L3 - A1.ogg]] ![[Una - Una on Darkness _5 - L3 - A2.ogg]]

Finn: I think the Thane and Lady of Holten made a deal. Reckon they felt vulnerable after all that happened here in Ogham. Many think they were forced into all this, but I think... yeah, I think they were {willing}.
 ![[Una - Una on Darkness _5 - L4 - A1.ogg]] ![[Una - Una on Darkness _5 - L4 - A2.ogg]] ![[Una - Una on Darkness _5 - L4 - A3.ogg]]

Una: I fear you may be right.
 ![[Una - Una on Darkness _5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]


## Una on Fey Spirits /1
Una: It seems they gather here for a reason... seems they were trapped within that cursed one... With their aid, perhaps you'll be able to pass through the Blackwood...

## Una on Saving the World /4
Una: You've saved us again. I can't thank you enough. Now... our people follow you to save the world, I suppose.
 ![[Una - Una on Saving the World _4 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Una - Una on Saving the World _4 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

Finn: As long as we're together, we can face anything.
 ![[Una - Una on Saving the World _4 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Una: I'll play songs to soothe our brave soldiers' nerves.
 ![[Una - Una on Saving the World _4 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Finn: Ahh... my talented songbird.
 ![[Una - Una on Saving the World _4 - L4 - A1.ogg]]


## Una on Introduction /5
Una: Welcome back. It is good to see you.
 ![[Una - Una on Introduction _5 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Finn: And you're alive!
 ![[Una - Una on Introduction _5 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Una: You're home!
 ![[Una - Una on Introduction _5 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Finn: Bring it in here! Give your old pal Finn a hug! No? Alright. Fair.
 ![[Una - Una on Introduction _5 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Una: Much has happened since you've been gone. Please, speak to Renly. He's our reluctant leader now.
 ![[Una - Una on Introduction _5 - L5 - A1.ogg]] ![[Una - Una on Introduction _5 - L5 - A2.ogg]]


## Una on Stones of Serle /3
Una: There is a henge at the centre of the Stones of Serle. We could try to summon the fey spirits there.
 ![[Una - Una on Stones of Serle _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Finn: Them old stones, eh? There's a strange power there. An old power. Makes your hair stand on end, some days.
 ![[Una - Una on Stones of Serle _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]] ![[Una - Una on Stones of Serle _3 - L2 - A2.ogg]]

Una: It was one of the first sites the Ezomytes built when newcomers taught us runes so very long ago. That's why I hold out hope that we can still be heard. As the song goes, {'the darker the night, the brighter the runelight...'} If I can reach the fey spirits, they will help you push through the darkness of the Blackwood. They can show you the way.

## Una on Stones of Serle /1
Una: This henge was one of the first sites the Ezomytes built when newcomers taught us runes so very long ago. I knew it would still hold power! As the song goes, {'the darker the night, the brighter the runelight...'} The fey spirits heard us. They'll show you the way!
 ![[Una - Una on Stones of Serle _1 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Una - Una on Stones of Serle _1 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Una - Una on Stones of Serle _1 - L1 - A3.ogg]]


## Una on The Henge /7
Una: The henge at the centre of the Stones of Serle was one of the first sites the Ezomytes built when the newcomers taught us runes so very long ago.
 ![[Una - Una on The Henge _7 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Finn: Yeah, those stones are creepy. There's an odd power there. An old power. Makes your hair stand on end, some days.
 ![[Una - Una on The Henge _7 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Una: I knew it would still hold power! As the song goes, {'the darker the night, the brighter the runelight...'}
 ![[Una - Una on The Henge _7 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Finn: Yeah, it's true, too. Some nights, way back when, I'd huddle by a runed stone all night... ...just so the wolves wouldn't get me.
 ![[Una - Una on The Henge _7 - L4 - A1.ogg]] ![[Una - Una on The Henge _7 - L4 - A2.ogg]]

Una: Not to worry, it's okay. You've got a home now.
 ![[Una - Una on The Henge _7 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Finn: Don't think I'm not happy with it. I just dream big!
 ![[Una - Una on The Henge _7 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Una: {Two} kitchens, {four} bedrooms... yes, I know.
 ![[Una - Una on The Henge _7 - L7 - A1.ogg]]


## Una on Runes /8
Una: We keep our history in the form of songs. I don't exactly know how runes were first brought to us. All we know is that 'newcomers' arrived and gave us knowledge in exchange for food and shelter. One song says: {'There came a great storm, crashing across the sky...'} {'There came a great need, or the sodden would die.'} A children's tale speaks of fey folk who became human. A tribe that appeared out of a 'ring' of runes in the forest.

Finn: Hmm... I guess I never really thought about all the runed stones lying all over Phaaryl before. They just {were}. Always have been there.
 ![[Una - Una on Runes _8 - L2 - A1.ogg]] ![[Una - Una on Runes _8 - L2 - A2.ogg]]

Una: Someone must know. The newcomers never moved on. Their names are part of our clan histories now.
 ![[Una - Una on Runes _8 - L3 - A1.ogg]] ![[Una - Una on Runes _8 - L3 - A2.ogg]]

Finn: Wait, so... they... you know... with our ancestors?
 ![[Una - Una on Runes _8 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Una: Yes.
 ![[Una - Una on Runes _8 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Finn: Well that means I might never have been clanless! Maybe I'm from some long lost clan of heroic types from faraway!
 ![[Una - Una on Runes _8 - L6 - A1.ogg]] ![[Una - Una on Runes _8 - L6 - A2.ogg]]

Una: Yes, darling. You might very well be a hero's descendant.
 ![[Una - Una on Runes _8 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Finn: I friggin' knew it!
 ![[Una - Una on Runes _8 - L8 - A1.ogg]]


## Una on Trapped Draiocht /1
Una: Somehow, the forces in the Blackwood know about the henge. The darkness has thickened around the site. It will not let us do this without a fight.
