Mercenary: So all the pithy little Necromancers I've killed over the years... they got their juice from here?
 ![[Lurking Creature - Lurking Creature on Necromancy _2 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Lurking Creature: The Well was not. The Master Below All raged. Then, the Well was, and always had been. The more these ones fought and destroyed, the more souls spiraled into the Well. The nether exalted Kulemak. He rose, and walked the Boundless Cavern above, enduring the searing light and heat without pain. To wage the war, he gifted power to his servants, and they became the Lich Lords. The Lich Lords gifted power to their servants, and they became the Necromancers. These ones have been fighting so long, the Well spirals... the nether overflows... Countless screams blend into one endless exhale that can be heard even in the Boundless Cavern.

## Lurking Creature on Boundless Cavern /1
Lurking Creature: You come from the Boundless Cavern. No stone in sight above, only fire and void. Hateful beings, spawned by flesh, skitter in the searing light. They seek to rend these ones. To destroy them. This one has never been. This one serves here. This one is frightened.

 ![[Lurking Creature - Lurking Creature on Serving _2 - L8 - A1.ogg]]


## Lurking Creature on The Source /10
Lurking Creature: The edge beckons. The Source calls from below. Souls spiral, drawn by the call. All souls that return, all stilled flesh that yet moves. The Source gives motion, if not life.

Mercenary: Ah shite, you mean the undead?
 ![[Lurking Creature - Lurking Creature on The Source _10 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Lurking Creature: It is so. The Well of Souls is the Source of all Necromancy.
 ![[Lurking Creature - Lurking Creature on The Source _10 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Lurking Creature: You know it is true, master. You draw upon the Source. You channel it through your soul.
 ![[Lurking Creature - Lurking Creature on The Source _10 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: No. My power is my own!
 ![[Lurking Creature - Lurking Creature on The Source _10 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Lurking Creature: All Necromancy flows from the Well of Souls; from the Source below. Look at the light, master. Look at its weave... its... colour...
 ![[Lurking Creature - Lurking Creature on The Source _10 - L12 - A1.ogg]] ![[Lurking Creature - Lurking Creature on The Source _10 - L12 - A2.ogg]]

Witch: The light of the nether... it's the same...

 ![[Lurking Creature - Lurking Creature on The Well _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: The hell is this place, anyway?
 ![[Lurking Creature - Lurking Creature on The Well _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]
