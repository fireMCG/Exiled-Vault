## Elder Madox on The First Children /1
Elder Madox: Is this story time!? Ugh. The First Children were sent to us for protection. They were nothing but trouble. Banished into the wastes, despite the ash and famine. Tragic. The People of the Mountains were very proud of the {Last} Children, though.

## Elder Madox on Hesitation /1
Elder Madox: I saw what was coming. The wayward spear and her people... They lost sight of the Spirit. They fell to the promises of the Snake. I should have acted. But I did not. And now, I observe... alone.

## Elder Madox on Introduction /1
Elder Madox: I am Elder Madox. Here... I observe the biting chill of the gale... ... while I mourn our losses. The Winter Owl blesses you, and the Spirit concedes. I have little time left in this world, and I am on my last adventure. From here, I shall observe winter across three weeks of night. Then, I shall join the wisdom of owls who came before me. Before you depart... I bear a gift.

Elder Madox: I am Elder Madox. Your silencing of the Wayward Spear has calmed the Spirit. Here... I observe the biting chill of the gale... ... while I mourn our losses. The Winter Owl blesses you, and the Spirit concedes. I have little time left in this world, and I am on my last adventure. From here, I shall observe winter across three weeks of night. Then, I shall join the wisdom of owls who came before me. Before you depart... I bear a gift.

## Elder Madox on The Last Children /1
Elder Madox: Solari, Lunari, and Viridi, of course. I know that you know them! How could you not? Solari and Lunari are right there in the sky, and Viridi is beneath your very feet! You tease an old man. Leave me be.

## Elder Madox on The Mother Soul /1
Elder Madox: The Mother Soul was hope. The will to carry on, no matter the cost. No matter the sacrifice. No matter the {consequences}... The People of the Mountains cut ties with the Mother Soul long ago. We know not why, only that it happened. The First Children might be the only ones that could recall such things now.

## Elder Madox on The Snake /1
Elder Madox: The Spirit is all things. The Spirit is the world, and it is us... but the Snake stands alone. The Snake whispers. Lies. Manipulates. It has been so since the time of the Mother Soul. And now it speaks as the Spirit, but is not, leading the foolish to ruin.

## Elder Madox on Observing /1
Elder Madox: It is my choice. My decision. I've lost greatly. In a moment's hesitation, I allowed untold suffering to befall my tribe. So now. I observe. Not as penance. Not for forgiveness. Just so.
