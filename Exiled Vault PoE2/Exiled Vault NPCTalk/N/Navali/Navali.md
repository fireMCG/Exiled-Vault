## Navali on The End of Time /10
Navali: Some ends are peaceful, even quiet. Some are bloody, loud, and reckless. Some are lonely... and those are the worst. But the End of Time is not to be feared. It is a release. A mercy. All the pains of a long and weary existence will fall away from us. Then... we shall see the world with innocent eyes once more.

Warrior: I never had the chance to feel young and free... Are we doomed to do this all again?
 ![[Navali - Navali on The End of Time _10 - L2 - A1.ogg]] ![[Navali - Navali on The End of Time _10 - L2 - A2.ogg]]

Witch: Hah, innocent eyes? Sure. So, you truly believe in the Cycle of Time?
 ![[Navali - Navali on The End of Time _10 - L3 - A1.ogg]] ![[Navali - Navali on The End of Time _10 - L3 - A2.ogg]]

Sorceress: Ah, I see. You fear the end, but long for the new beginning.
 ![[Navali - Navali on The End of Time _10 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: You speak of renewal. Of new life.
 ![[Navali - Navali on The End of Time _10 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: That sounds... lovely. Like the cycle of life, the end is not to be feared.
 ![[Navali - Navali on The End of Time _10 - L6 - A1.ogg]] ![[Navali - Navali on The End of Time _10 - L6 - A2.ogg]]

Huntress: I've never felt so small. It's humbling.
 ![[Navali - Navali on The End of Time _10 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Forgive me, miss, but it sounds like you {remember} all these dooms.
 ![[Navali - Navali on The End of Time _10 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Navali: Yes. You and I shall have this conversation again... ...as we have before... many times.
 ![[Navali - Navali on The End of Time _10 - L9 - A1.ogg]] ![[Navali - Navali on The End of Time _10 - L9 - A2.ogg]]

Witch: Of course. And how long is one of these Cycles, supposedly?
 ![[Navali - Navali on The End of Time _10 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Navali: The life of an Elder, but twice, a hundred times over, then thrice and once.
 ![[Navali - Navali on The End of Time _10 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: That's... um... quite specific...?
 ![[Navali - Navali on The End of Time _10 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Navali: That is the longest we have ever endured. But really, It depends on the nature of the end...
 ![[Navali - Navali on The End of Time _10 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: When are we now, compared to all that?
 ![[Navali - Navali on The End of Time _10 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Navali: There are very few prophecies that have yet to come to pass.
 ![[Navali - Navali on The End of Time _10 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: So... this is what fear feels like... I don't think I like it.
 ![[Navali - Navali on The End of Time _10 - L16 - A1.ogg]]


## Navali on Service /3
Navali: Time passes slowly for me, but it does pass. My service is not endless. The renowned {hatungo} Narumoa served before me, and others served before her.
 ![[Navali - Navali on Service _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Navali - Navali on Service _3 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

Warrior: What will happen to you when your service ends?
 ![[Navali - Navali on Service _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: And when your time is up - what then?
 ![[Navali - Navali on Service _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: How could you step aside, knowing what you know?
 ![[Navali - Navali on Service _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: I see. One day, you will be free.
 ![[Navali - Navali on Service _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: One day... they'll just replace you?
 ![[Navali - Navali on Service _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: It'd be a hard role to give up, I bet.
 ![[Navali - Navali on Service _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Guess we're all just footmen in someone's war, eh? Burdened by our memories.
 ![[Navali - Navali on Service _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Navali: I can only remember my Future-Past while my soul is bound to Hinekora. Life and death draw ever closer together... ...and oblivion lies in wait.
 ![[Navali - Navali on Service _3 - L9 - A1.ogg]] ![[Navali - Navali on Service _3 - L9 - A2.ogg]] ![[Navali - Navali on Service _3 - L9 - A3.ogg]]


## Navali on Trial of the Ancestors /1
Navali: You will one day be welcomed here. Hinekora invites you to fight in our Trial of the Ancestors, to test yourself to your absolute limits. But now is not that time. When the time comes, you will know...
 ![[Navali - Navali on Trial of the Ancestors _1 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Navali - Navali on Trial of the Ancestors _1 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Navali - Navali on Trial of the Ancestors _1 - L1 - A3.ogg]] ![[Navali - Navali on Trial of the Ancestors _1 - L1 - A4.ogg]]


## Navali on The Mother of Death /25
Navali: Hinekora sees you. The past is laid bare before her. She knows you. But now... she listens. You may speak.
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _25 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _25 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _25 - L1 - A3.ogg]]

Warrior: Hinekora... I am honoured. I would ask you, how do I find my true family? How do I learn of my tribe?
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _25 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Hinekora: The greatest smith crafts armour for the heart. The joy of today is the only happiness most ever find. A good man stands in for the absent.
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _25 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: I believe... I understand. Thank you.
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _25 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: From one Mother of Death to another, what words of wisdom do you have for me?
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _25 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Hinekora: They scarred and violated the hated criminal, but she punishes herself far more than they ever could. The wounds are obvious for all to see, despite the concealing bandages.
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _25 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: I... don't know what she's talking about. That's just... rambling nonsense.
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _25 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Tell me, Mother of Death, will I find my place in this world?
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _25 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Hinekora: A weary traveler stumbles down the mountain, smiling, only to see a vast range ahead. Surrounded by watching faces, a child plays in the sand.
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _25 - L9 - A1.ogg]] ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _25 - L9 - A2.ogg]]

Sorceress: Oh! Is he... happy?
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _25 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

: Yes.
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _25 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: That's... good. That is... good to hear.
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _25 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: If I may ask... I seek the truth of my beliefs. I suspect, I fear...
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _25 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Hinekora: A foreign prince brings a sliver of hope to a land in peril. A rat gnaws its way out of the crocodile's stomach.
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _25 - L14 - A1.ogg]] ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _25 - L14 - A2.ogg]]

Monk: Yes.. it certainly does...
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _25 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Did my mother's soul pass this way? If not, where might I find her? Does she still exist... somewhere?
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _25 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Hinekora: One alone will stand on dunes of silver and breathe deep the void. The leaping cat catches the mouse, but loses its way. It will never return home. Nor will it make amends.
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _25 - L17 - A1.ogg]] ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _25 - L17 - A2.ogg]] ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _25 - L17 - A3.ogg]]

Ranger: I fear I can never forgive her... but I have to try.
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _25 - L18 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: I have but one question, honoured Mother of Death. How do I hear the Spirit's voice again?
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _25 - L19 - A1.ogg]]

Hinekora: Whispered words offer guidance to the pure, but silence is a - ...yes... now?... The sea goes still.
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _25 - L20 - A1.ogg]] ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _25 - L20 - A2.ogg]] ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _25 - L20 - A3.ogg]]

Huntress: What? That's it? What's happening?
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _25 - L21 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: So what do ya think, Miss Hinekora? Are we gonna survive this?
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _25 - L22 - A1.ogg]]

Hinekora: Night promises peace, but the sun refuses to set. There is no one waiting on the other side of the river.
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _25 - L23 - A1.ogg]] ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _25 - L23 - A2.ogg]]

Mercenary: You... you what? You cant just... you can't say things like that, mate...
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _25 - L24 - A1.ogg]]

Navali: The Mother of Death... has spoken. And... gives a gift!
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _25 - L25 - A1.ogg]] ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _25 - L25 - A2.ogg]]

Navali: The Mother of Death... has spoken.
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _25 - L26 - A1.ogg]]


## Navali on The Invitation /3
Navali: It is a great honour to participate in our Trial of the Ancestors. It is very rare that an outsider is allowed to participate.
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Invitation _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Navali - Navali on The Invitation _3 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

Warrior: I am honoured to be part of this heritage.
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Invitation _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Of course. I'm rather exceptional.
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Invitation _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I will respect and honour your ways.
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Invitation _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: I am honoured, and I will attend.
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Invitation _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Alright. Maybe I'll come by.
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Invitation _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: You have my thanks, and I will do my best.
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Invitation _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: No need for all that, I'm game.
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Invitation _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Navali: You will know when the time is right. For now, we are not undertaking the Trials. Too many are... refusing.
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Invitation _3 - L9 - A1.ogg]] ![[Navali - Navali on The Invitation _3 - L9 - A2.ogg]]


## Navali on The Cycle of Time /3
Warrior: What did you mean by 'Time circled upon itself?'
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Cycle of Time _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: I've read a claim like this once before, but I'm still skeptical. Tell me about this supposed 'Cycle of Time.'
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Cycle of Time _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Our tales have no mention of this 'circling of Time.' What is that?
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Cycle of Time _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: I've... dreamt about this... How does Time circle upon itself...?
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Cycle of Time _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: What's this about Time circling upon itself?
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Cycle of Time _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: My Elders once told me a story about a place where Time is a circle. What does that mean?
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Cycle of Time _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Time circled upon itself, eh? Do I dare ask?
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Cycle of Time _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Navali: One day, Time will end. Then, Time will begin again. Hinekora remembers the Future-Past. Not very clearly, but enough to guide our way forward. You do not remember our previous meetings... but I do, by the grace of Hinekora's sight.
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Cycle of Time _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]] ![[Navali - Navali on The Cycle of Time _3 - L8 - A2.ogg]] ![[Navali - Navali on The Cycle of Time _3 - L8 - A3.ogg]]

Mercenary: I shouldn't have asked.
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Cycle of Time _3 - L9 - A1.ogg]]


## Navali on Water of Sight /3
Navali: Have no fear. I am both here {and} there. Just as you are now.
 ![[Navali - Navali on Water of Sight _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: With respect, Honoured One, how is this possible?
 ![[Navali - Navali on Water of Sight _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: This isn't necromancy... what {is} this?
 ![[Navali - Navali on Water of Sight _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: It cannot be. This is some sort of strange illusion.
 ![[Navali - Navali on Water of Sight _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: It sounds like a riddle, yet it must be fact. How?
 ![[Navali - Navali on Water of Sight _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: This is magic beyond the fey. Beyond the First Ones. How?
 ![[Navali - Navali on Water of Sight _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: By the Spirit! How've you done this?
 ![[Navali - Navali on Water of Sight _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Am I hallucinating? I quit the opium dens years ago.
 ![[Navali - Navali on Water of Sight _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Navali: The Water of Sight does not slay the living, just nearly so. The Water of Sight does not raise the dead... just nearly so. On the verge, we have one eye in each world. And so, I serve Hinekora. I am her Speaker, both in life... and in death.
 ![[Navali - Navali on Water of Sight _3 - L9 - A1.ogg]] ![[Navali - Navali on Water of Sight _3 - L9 - A2.ogg]] ![[Navali - Navali on Water of Sight _3 - L9 - A3.ogg]] ![[Navali - Navali on Water of Sight _3 - L9 - A4.ogg]]


## Navali on Afterlife /2
Warrior: This place... is an afterlife? For all Karui?
 ![[Navali - Navali on Afterlife _2 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: I almost don't want to question further... but I can't help myself.
 ![[Navali - Navali on Afterlife _2 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I still cannot comprehend this place. It makes no sense.
 ![[Navali - Navali on Afterlife _2 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Intriguing. The Karui have their own unique afterlife.
 ![[Navali - Navali on Afterlife _2 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: The only dead I've seen come back to life... well, that's no fate to wish upon anyone.
 ![[Navali - Navali on Afterlife _2 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: I feel sick. Please, let me wake up from whatever this is.
 ![[Navali - Navali on Afterlife _2 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: So... you're just lying there, having a real deep snooze then?
 ![[Navali - Navali on Afterlife _2 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Navali: The Mother of Death is all that stands between us and oblivion. Before she embraced us, those that died simply ceased to be. Now, the souls of the Karui people continue on, lending their wisdom and strength to those that follow...
 ![[Navali - Navali on Afterlife _2 - L8 - A1.ogg]] ![[Navali - Navali on Afterlife _2 - L8 - A2.ogg]] ![[Navali - Navali on Afterlife _2 - L8 - A3.ogg]]


## Navali on The Mother of Death /3
Navali: Our Mother of Death is gifted with the ability to see into the past. Her prophecies guide us on the eternal search for the way forward.
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _3 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

Warrior: How does seeing into the past help guide us?
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: This sounds suspiciously like a fanciful claim in the forbidden tomes...
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Our tale-women do something similar. The tales they tell guide us.
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: She sees into the past? How does that create prophecy?
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Where do her prophecies come from, if she only sees the past?
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: What am I missin'? She sees the past, but how does that make it prophecy?
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: So what, she learns from your mistakes? Makes some new plans?
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Navali: Before Wraeclast, before the Lake, before the primordial molten world, before the stars themselves... Time circled upon itself into infinity. Hinekora sees not what you {will} do, only what you {did,} and what you shall do again. Probably...
 ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _3 - L9 - A1.ogg]] ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _3 - L9 - A2.ogg]] ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _3 - L9 - A3.ogg]] ![[Navali - Navali on The Mother of Death _3 - L9 - A4.ogg]]


## Navali on Utula /3
Navali: One among us has elevated their angry voice above the others. Utula, of the Kitava Tribe, has long found the afterlife... constricting. He has convinced several others to become unruly. They are refusing to fight, and causing great disturbances.
 ![[Navali - Navali on Utula _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Navali - Navali on Utula _3 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Navali - Navali on Utula _3 - L1 - A3.ogg]] ![[Navali - Navali on Utula _3 - L1 - A4.ogg]]

Warrior: Why are they being so disrespectful?
 ![[Navali - Navali on Utula _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Is being dead not to his liking?
 ![[Navali - Navali on Utula _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: That sounds like a great dishonour.
 ![[Navali - Navali on Utula _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: The dead can do such things?
 ![[Navali - Navali on Utula _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Why're they doin' that?
 ![[Navali - Navali on Utula _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: I don't understand. Why would he do that?
 ![[Navali - Navali on Utula _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: What's up his arse?
 ![[Navali - Navali on Utula _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Navali: Utula has convinced them they could overthrow this place, or even escape. We have done the best we can for the souls here, but it is not enough for some. This often happens with souls new to this timeless existence. It will pass... as it always does.
 ![[Navali - Navali on Utula _3 - L9 - A1.ogg]] ![[Navali - Navali on Utula _3 - L9 - A2.ogg]] ![[Navali - Navali on Utula _3 - L9 - A3.ogg]] ![[Navali - Navali on Utula _3 - L9 - A4.ogg]]
