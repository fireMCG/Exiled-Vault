## Zarka on Consequences /1
Zarka: For most, the {sel khari's} secrecy is kept on pain of death... but for you, there will be no violence. No. If you reveal this secret... I will tell embarrassing stories about you, and pass them down to those that come after me! You {will} be remembered, but not as a hero... as a bumbling fool. A subject of mockery. It is a form of retaliation worse than death, second only to being forgotten. Please do not force me to fulfil this duty.

## Zarka on Gifting of Water /1
Zarka: There are certain steps that need to be taken to recognise a {Sekhema} of {Sekhemas.} The Gifting of Water is a sign of solidarity between our {akharas}. If it does not go well, the others may see it as a sign that Asala is too weak to lead... Ahh... we cannot let that happen.

## Zarka on Oriath /1
Zarka: I knew you would not let us down. In turn, {we} will not let {you} down. The Maraketh have been roused to war, and it is war we shall bring! If this is the end of times, then we will forge one last great tale to tell before Nekraata! The sum total of life's meaning - and it will be glorious. To Oriath, young one.

## Zarka on Order of the Djinn /1
Zarka: Ah, so the Order of the Djinn {has} been rebuilding these last twenty years. I suspected this was the case. The other tale-women talk of movements in the shadows. Tombs found open. Artefacts stolen. When these powerful relics never appeared in the hands of the Faridun, I knew it had to be someone more trustworthy... There are tales we tell, and tales we do {not} tell. The Order has long fought to preserve this world... You would do well to earn their trust, young one.

## Zarka on Pools of Khatal /1
Zarka: Ah, the Pools of Khatal! I was young and spry last time I dared their rejuvenating depths. Long ago, there was a tale-man - yes, that's right, a male tale-woman! It's true! He had a unique gift for shaping water. His {akhara} was beset by creatures of darkness in the early years of the Winter of the World, before the alliance was forged. It was the cold season, and the river had frozen. They built a fortress out of ice, but water was scarce. Ironic, yes? Being surrounded by water, even defended by it, for months... but dying of thirst. Khatal sensed water. He knew not where. He pulled with all his mystic might. He lifted his hands to the sky, beseeching the winds. The winds did not answer. This was long before Garukhan tamed them. Khatal would not give up. He tore at {something}, water {somewhere}... and finally, it emerged. From beneath! It ripped from the ground in great geysers, bringing both water {and} warmth. Not only that, the water collapsed the enemy's tunnels, crushing an entire legion of creatures. His {akhara} was saved... but Khatal turned to dust. He gave his very soul in the effort. Ahh... we honour his sacrifice still, by stopping at his mud pools on the way to the Gifting of Water.

## Zarka on Risu's Training /1
Zarka: Risu's training is coming along well. She has a mind for tales. When she is ready to replace me, I am going to go on a journey. I'd like to visit all the places I've been describing my whole life. Ezomyr, Ngamakanui... I hear Trarthus has rather invigorating vapours... Don't act so shocked. I've done my duty. It's time to live a little! Especially if the world is about to end...

## Zarka on Sel Khari /1
Zarka: The location of the {sel khari} is closely guarded. You must never speak of it to anyone... or there will be consequences! Ascend the tower of Ab Binayi. At its height you will find a guiding seal. Activate it, and you will be shown the way.

## Zarka on Punishment /1
Zarka: The {sel khari} were attacked? This is exactly why we keep their location secret! These criminals deserve the greatest punishment we can give... Hmm... Balbala's prison {is} free...
