## Doryani on Spires /2
Warrior: We face a dark enemy, below the dirt. They seem to be trying to use Vaal technology... to bring about darkness above ground.
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Spires _2 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Doryani - Doryani on Spires _2 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

Witch: The Abyssals are trying to use Vaal spires. I guess we shouldn't let that happen...
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Spires _2 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: There were Vaal spires in the darkness. The ancient enemy is plotting something.
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Spires _2 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: I saw Vaal structures, deep down. Used by the Abyssals.
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Spires _2 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Under the earth, there were... spires. Like the ones I saw in Utzaal.
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Spires _2 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: I believe I saw Vaal architecture in use by the Abyssals.
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Spires _2 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: These creatures down there - they're toyin' with some of your Vaal technology. Seems they're trying to plunge the world into darkness or somethin'.
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Spires _2 - L7 - A1.ogg]] ![[Doryani - Doryani on Spires _2 - L7 - A2.ogg]]

Doryani: Hmm. It does sound like our technology. Architect Topotante was conducting experiments with the weather. I am uncertain how these devices may have been modified. You should destroy all traces of them. Otherwise, it could mean our doom.

## Doryani on The Third Edict /5
Warrior: What do you think the Edicts were?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on The Third Edict _5 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: What of these... Edicts then?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on The Third Edict _5 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: What were these 'Edicts'?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on The Third Edict _5 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Do you know what the Edicts were?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on The Third Edict _5 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: What were these 'Edicts'?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on The Third Edict _5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Do we have any information on the Edicts?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on The Third Edict _5 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Know anything about them 'Edicts'?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on The Third Edict _5 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: We have very little information, but if the Seed of Corruption was the instrument of the Second Edict... It may have been created in response to an unknown {First} Edict.
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on The Third Edict _5 - L8 - A1.ogg]] ![[Doryani - Doryani on The Third Edict _5 - L8 - A2.ogg]]

The Hooded One: The first mural I saw was broken... but there was definitely something there. They must have been facing some disaster... or enemy... or change in the world. Did they create the Seed of Corruption in response?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on The Third Edict _5 - L9 - A1.ogg]] ![[Doryani - Doryani on The Third Edict _5 - L9 - A2.ogg]] ![[Doryani - Doryani on The Third Edict _5 - L9 - A3.ogg]]

Doryani: Hmm. Whenever the Vaal built something dangerous, we also ran a parallel project... ...as a contingency. The Weapon. The instrument of the Third Edict. I believe it is a failsafe. If the Seed of Corruption grew out of control, then perhaps it was designed to... shut down the experiment.
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on The Third Edict _5 - L10 - A1.ogg]] ![[Doryani - Doryani on The Third Edict _5 - L10 - A2.ogg]] ![[Doryani - Doryani on The Third Edict _5 - L10 - A3.ogg]] ![[Doryani - Doryani on The Third Edict _5 - L10 - A4.ogg]]

The Hooded One: Then that is exactly what we will do.
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on The Third Edict _5 - L11 - A1.ogg]]


## Doryani on Precursor Forge /4
Warrior: What might this Precursor forge look like?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Precursor Forge _4 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: This forge of the Precursors... what are we looking for?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Precursor Forge _4 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: What do we know of the forge?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Precursor Forge _4 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Do we know anything about the forge?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Precursor Forge _4 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Tell me about the forge.
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Precursor Forge _4 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: What are we looking for? What does the forge look like?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Precursor Forge _4 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: We're lookin' for a forge? What kind?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Precursor Forge _4 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: It is older than any other civilisation on Wraeclast. Only stone will remain. Anything else would have long since decayed.
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Precursor Forge _4 - L8 - A1.ogg]] ![[Doryani - Doryani on Precursor Forge _4 - L8 - A2.ogg]]

Warrior: But how will we know when we see it? There's stone everywhere.
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Precursor Forge _4 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Any other telltale signs of Precursor handiwork?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Precursor Forge _4 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I do not know how to tell what I am looking for.
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Precursor Forge _4 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Anything else about their architecture I should keep in mind?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Precursor Forge _4 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: I've seen plenty of stone in my time. How will I know I'm lookin' at their work?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Precursor Forge _4 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: That is not a lot to go by. How will I know when I see something Precursor designed?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Precursor Forge _4 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Well, how do I tell something has been made by them Precursors?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Precursor Forge _4 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: They were masters of their world. They built structures whose mere remnants inspire awe... even in me. You will know it when you see it. The Vaal would have supplanted their legacy... had we but time.
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Precursor Forge _4 - L16 - A1.ogg]] ![[Doryani - Doryani on Precursor Forge _4 - L16 - A2.ogg]] ![[Doryani - Doryani on Precursor Forge _4 - L16 - A3.ogg]]


## Doryani on Kingsmarch /7
Doryani: This is it? This... is Kingsmarch? Science and civilisation must have never recovered.
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Kingsmarch _7 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

The Hooded One: Your time was different, yes, but don't discount the Kalguurans just yet. They have potential.
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Kingsmarch _7 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: Hmm... we shall see.
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Kingsmarch _7 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Oi. Where did Alva get to?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Kingsmarch _7 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: So... where is Alva?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Kingsmarch _7 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: Where is Alva?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Kingsmarch _7 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Where's the annoying optimist?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Kingsmarch _7 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Where did Alva go?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Kingsmarch _7 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Did Alva come this way?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Kingsmarch _7 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: So, fellas... where's Alva?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Kingsmarch _7 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

The Hooded One: She has gone ahead to meet her local contact.
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Kingsmarch _7 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: We will need a vessel to navigate the archipelago. We must begin our search to locate the pieces of the Weapon.
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Kingsmarch _7 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Behave yourselves, will ya?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Kingsmarch _7 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Please - remain civil in my absence.
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Kingsmarch _7 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: Try and get along, you two.
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Kingsmarch _7 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Don't kill each other while I'm gone... or do.
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Kingsmarch _7 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Please... try to put aside your differences in my absence.
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Kingsmarch _7 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Try not to bicker too much while I'm gone, will you?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Kingsmarch _7 - L18 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Alright. Don't go havin' a street brawl while I'm gone. I wanna watch.
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Kingsmarch _7 - L19 - A1.ogg]]


## Doryani on Murals /3
Doryani: I must concur with... the Hooded One. Someone intentionally carved information meant to be discovered in the future. To do such a thing, they must have believed that their civilisation might be endangered. However, the most important clues I found were done differently. Hand carvings. We found them in this region. The stones depicted pieces of the Weapon being thrown into the sea.
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Murals _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Doryani - Doryani on Murals _3 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Doryani - Doryani on Murals _3 - L1 - A3.ogg]] ![[Doryani - Doryani on Murals _3 - L1 - A4.ogg]]

Warrior: Did someone want to get rid of it?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Murals _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Someone didn't want it around?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Murals _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Why would someone try to dispose of it?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Murals _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Why'd they try to get rid of it?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Murals _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Someone tried to make it missin'?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Murals _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Interesting. Someone endeavoured to make it disappear?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Murals _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Someone wanted it gone then, eh?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Murals _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: Their reasoning was unclear. But from what I saw, it was thrown not by soldiers, but by a woman. A scientist... ... and I have no idea who she was.
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Murals _3 - L9 - A1.ogg]] ![[Doryani - Doryani on Murals _3 - L9 - A2.ogg]] ![[Doryani - Doryani on Murals _3 - L9 - A3.ogg]]


## Doryani on The Weapon /3
Huntress: So... where should I start huntin'?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on The Weapon _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: I do not see an immediate path. Where should we begin?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on The Weapon _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: With all you know of the Weapon, where should our search begin?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on The Weapon _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Where am I to search for your toys?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on The Weapon _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Where should we be looking for the pieces?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on The Weapon _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Where are we headed first?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on The Weapon _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: So... if I were a weapon piece, where'd I be hidin'?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on The Weapon _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: We know the pieces of the Weapon radiate intense latent Corruption. The more dangerous an island is, the more likely it is to contain a piece of it.
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on The Weapon _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]] ![[Doryani - Doryani on The Weapon _3 - L8 - A2.ogg]]

The Hooded One: It is crucial that we find a Captain with in-depth knowledge of the local area. Then we will stand a better chance of finding what we seek.
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on The Weapon _3 - L9 - A1.ogg]]


## Doryani on The Vaal /2
Warrior: After this is over... you want the Weapon, don't you? To go back and prevent your Cataclysm?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on The Vaal _2 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Come now, Doryani. You clearly want to take back the Weapon to save your people. I'm not stupid.
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on The Vaal _2 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Do you intend to go back and stop your Cataclysm after this?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on The Vaal _2 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: One day, will you go back and save your people with the Weapon?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on The Vaal _2 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: What will you do, when all this is over? Will you return to your people and try to save them?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on The Vaal _2 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: What of your people? Will you try to save them with the Weapon, when this is over?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on The Vaal _2 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Well, how about the Vaal? We got this Third Edict thing - can we save them, too?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on The Vaal _2 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: I cannot. Unfortunately, that is not how Time works. Everything one {knows} will happen, {did} happen. This is the one case where ignorance can be a scientist's greatest asset. I must learn as little about history as possible while I am in this era...
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on The Vaal _2 - L8 - A1.ogg]] ![[Doryani - Doryani on The Vaal _2 - L8 - A2.ogg]] ![[Doryani - Doryani on The Vaal _2 - L8 - A3.ogg]] ![[Doryani - Doryani on The Vaal _2 - L8 - A4.ogg]]


## Doryani on Alliance /1
Doryani: The Vaal shall stand with Wraeclast against the Beast. If we had this alliance in my era, things would have turned out differently. Let us make things right. This must be the last cycle of history.
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Alliance _1 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Doryani - Doryani on Alliance _1 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Doryani - Doryani on Alliance _1 - L1 - A3.ogg]]


## Doryani on Cuachic Vault /4
Doryani: Before us stands Mount Kriar, the most isolated peak in the Azmeri Ranges. At its summit, you will find the Cuachic Vault. There is no predicting the state of those within. If their discipline and loyalty endure after all these generations, they will know us by a certain phrase. Tell them, 'the time of the sparrow has come.'
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Cuachic Vault _4 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Doryani - Doryani on Cuachic Vault _4 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Doryani - Doryani on Cuachic Vault _4 - L1 - A3.ogg]]

Warrior: 'The time of the sparrow has come.' I will remember this.
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Cuachic Vault _4 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: They'll hear that and suddenly surrender? You best be right about that.
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Cuachic Vault _4 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I will give them this message...
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Cuachic Vault _4 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: The time of the sparrow has come. Alright, got it.
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Cuachic Vault _4 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Maybe you should come with me...
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Cuachic Vault _4 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: I shall seek out the Cuachic and deliver your message.
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Cuachic Vault _4 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: What happens if I forget?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Cuachic Vault _4 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: {Don't} forget... but...
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Cuachic Vault _4 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: If they will not listen, I will come to assist you. Remember, subdue them, but do not kill them. They will fight for us, one way or another.
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Cuachic Vault _4 - L10 - A1.ogg]] ![[Doryani - Doryani on Cuachic Vault _4 - L10 - A2.ogg]]


## Doryani on Contingency /1
Doryani: In my youth, all I wanted was power. I was the smartest. The sharpest. I rose to prominence on sheer force of will. Once I became the right hand of Queen Atziri, I realised that the system of merit I believed in was an illusion. Knowledge and science were merely ruthless tools for the nobles in their mad quest for eternal dominion. I had no {power.} I was a slave. From then on, I spent every spare moment secretly pursuing ways to save my people. I placated Atziri and the nobles by day, but fought a war against death itself by night. The flesh. The soul. Machinery. Time itself. No possibility was left unexplored. If all else failed... that is what the Cuachic Vault was for. Should the entire world be ravaged by the Cataclysm, some Vaal would still remain, deep in the most remote mountain. The final and most desperate contingency...
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Contingency _1 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Doryani - Doryani on Contingency _1 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Doryani - Doryani on Contingency _1 - L1 - A3.ogg]] ![[Doryani - Doryani on Contingency _1 - L1 - A4.ogg]] ![[Doryani - Doryani on Contingency _1 - L1 - A5.ogg]] ![[Doryani - Doryani on Contingency _1 - L1 - A6.ogg]] ![[Doryani - Doryani on Contingency _1 - L1 - A7.ogg]] ![[Doryani - Doryani on Contingency _1 - L1 - A8.ogg]] ![[Doryani - Doryani on Contingency _1 - L1 - A9.ogg]]


## Doryani on Living Vaal /1
Doryani: I am wary, now, after hearing about the... {people...} living in sunken Utzaal in your era. Isolation and containment drove them to horrific ends. There were systems put in place in Cuachic to avoid such problems, but the Vault was never intended to last this long. If the people in the vault are still healthy and sane after all this time, it will be proof that the Vaal are indeed worthy of my extreme efforts. If they are {not...} I already suspect what might have gone wrong...
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Living Vaal _1 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Doryani - Doryani on Living Vaal _1 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Doryani - Doryani on Living Vaal _1 - L1 - A3.ogg]] ![[Doryani - Doryani on Living Vaal _1 - L1 - A4.ogg]] ![[Doryani - Doryani on Living Vaal _1 - L1 - A5.ogg]]


## Doryani on Filling out the Ranks /1
Doryani: The Cataclysm came sooner than I'd hoped. The full complement of originally intended inhabitants was not achievable. I had to fill out the ranks with some candidates that I had previously ruled out due to their... religious proclivities. Blood rituals and sacrificial rites were not uncommon in the Empire, but I disdained such wastefulness. More than that, religion tends to spread in confined spaces. I can only hope sanity has prevailed within the Vault.
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Filling out the Ranks _1 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Doryani - Doryani on Filling out the Ranks _1 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Doryani - Doryani on Filling out the Ranks _1 - L1 - A3.ogg]] ![[Doryani - Doryani on Filling out the Ranks _1 - L1 - A4.ogg]]


## Doryani on Spirit of the Vaal /6
Doryani: Fools! Did you not hear the code phrase?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Spirit of the Vaal _6 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Zelina: ... is it really you?
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Spirit of the Vaal _6 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Zolin: By Atziri! Doryani himself!? I am not worthy!
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Spirit of the Vaal _6 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: You seem sane enough. The spirit of the Vaal endures. Assemble yourselves. The time has come. You will march forth unto war.
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Spirit of the Vaal _6 - L4 - A1.ogg]] ![[Doryani - Doryani on Spirit of the Vaal _6 - L4 - A2.ogg]]

Zolin: As you wish, Master Thaumaturge.
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Spirit of the Vaal _6 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Doryani: Let us meet back in Kingsmarch. The Cuachic shall join our cause.
 ![[Doryani - Doryani on Spirit of the Vaal _6 - L6 - A1.ogg]]
