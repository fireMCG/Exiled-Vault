## Dannig on Tavakai /3
Dannig: I don't think we're going to find ourselves in open warfare, but Tavakai has recently slowed trade and restricted us to the docks at their settlement. That whale incident certainly didn't help...
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Tavakai _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Did something happen to a whale?
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Tavakai _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: What? What happened?
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Tavakai _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: What happened with the whale?
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Tavakai _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Whale incident? That sounds juicy.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Tavakai _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: A what? A... whale?
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Tavakai _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: What whale incident?
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Tavakai _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Oi... whale incidents are never good.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Tavakai _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: Our king commanded one of our vessels to hunt and harvest meat from a sacred whale, knowing full well what it meant to the Karui. By the time I found out, I was already too late. Tavakai hasn't spoken to me since.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Tavakai _3 - L9 - A1.ogg]]


## Dannig on The Expedition /3
Dannig: Kingsmarch is actually our second attempt at settling on Wraeclast. Our first expedition, thousands of years back, was mysteriously lost.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on The Expedition _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Really? Are you sure?
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on The Expedition _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: The Azmeri remember. The stories say we came to their aid, but it was too late. What happened?
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on The Expedition _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: History lost outweighs history remembered. Do you have any idea what happened?
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on The Expedition _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Typical Wraeclast. What happened?
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on The Expedition _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: To lose the telling of a tale is one of the heart's worst burdens.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on The Expedition _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: What happened to them?
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on The Expedition _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Their mistake was trying the mainland. Probably a tragic tale, that. What happened?
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on The Expedition _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: That's why we came here twenty years ago, to find out... and we also sought the artefact of power our forebears brought with them to Wraeclast. It has become my life's work: the search for the Triskelion Flame!
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on The Expedition _3 - L9 - A1.ogg]]


## Dannig on Introduction /5
Dannig: Hmm... what do we have here?
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _5 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Precisely what I'd like to know.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _5 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Aye. That's what {I'm} wonderin'.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _5 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Enlighten me, Kalguuran.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _5 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: That's what you're here to tell me.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I was wondering the same. Let us think about this.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _5 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: I hoped you could tell {me}.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _5 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Cut to the chase, mate.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _5 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: Makeshift lodgings... markers... Yes. This looks like Gwennen's handiwork. She is still pursuing our grand quest, after all. But... she didn't finish what she started here. How odd.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _5 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Where do you think she is now?
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _5 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Seems she ain't here to speak to why.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _5 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: What do you think became of Gwennen?
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _5 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Oh my, is she dead? Where's her body?
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _5 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: We must remain hopeful. Perhaps she just became distracted.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _5 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: What stopped her?
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _5 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Left without the treasure... Not a good sign.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _5 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: I'm sure she had her reasons to cut and run. There's all manner of monstrosities out here! In any case, it seems she left us some clues as to what's in the area... When you're ready, let's see what we can unearth. Place the first explosive and we'll get started.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _5 - L17 - A1.ogg]] ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _5 - L17 - A2.ogg]]


## Dannig on Qualified Archaeologist /3
Dannig: You made that look easy, dare I say! You're well on your way to being a qualified archaeologist at this rate.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Qualified Archaeologist _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: I'd prefer a more peaceful line of work.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Qualified Archaeologist _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Let's do that again sometime!
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Qualified Archaeologist _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: It was quite loud... but enjoyable.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Qualified Archaeologist _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: The explosions were quite delightful, I must admit...
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Qualified Archaeologist _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: You are quite the charmer. But yes, my heart is still racing!
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Qualified Archaeologist _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: Seems a risky occupation...
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Qualified Archaeologist _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Cheers, Dannig. I had... a blast.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Qualified Archaeologist _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: Well, I hope the bounty was worth the risk. I must say, it usually is... I'll stay behind and see if I can find any clues as to where Gwennen went off to. See you back in Kingsmarch!
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Qualified Archaeologist _3 - L9 - A1.ogg]] ![[Dannig - Dannig on Qualified Archaeologist _3 - L9 - A2.ogg]]


## Dannig on Journey's End /2
Dannig: I should have trusted my instincts. I knew something was strange about that situation. I suppose this confirms the Hartlins are long dead...
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Journey's End _2 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Dannig - Dannig on Journey's End _2 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

Ranger: On the rare occasions I trust, I tend to get burned.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Journey's End _2 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: No way we coulda known.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Journey's End _2 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Hopefully, it happened for a reason.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Journey's End _2 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Obviously. Tujen insisted, though, so I decided... why not?
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Journey's End _2 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I think it used my memories of my akharas tale-women against me... it made fools of us all.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Journey's End _2 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: My father taught me to help those in need. Lying is their dishonour, not ours.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Journey's End _2 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Damn thing played on my penchant for older women. Bastard genius.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Journey's End _2 - L8 - A1.ogg]]


## Dannig on Virtue Gems /3
Dannig: We've had twenty years on Wraeclast, and those gems you use continue to perplex me. Clearly, they grant you mystical abilities, but they simply don't do anything in the hands of a Kalguuran.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Virtue Gems _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: That speaks to deeper mysteries in your nature. You sure?
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Virtue Gems _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Reckon you're lucky, then. They bring evil. You sure it's never worked for ya?
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Virtue Gems _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]] ![[Dannig - Dannig on Virtue Gems _3 - L3 - A2.ogg]]

Monk: Hmm... your presence does feel different to me. Are you sure it has never once worked?
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Virtue Gems _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]] ![[Dannig - Dannig on Virtue Gems _3 - L4 - A2.ogg]]

Witch: What, really? I can't believe I'm saying this, but that seems rather... unfair.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Virtue Gems _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I know it's impolite to ask this of a strong man, but did you make sure you... properly focused your will?
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Virtue Gems _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: Are you sure? Even with focused will?
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Virtue Gems _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Well good on ya for holding your own. If you're this good {without} gems, just imagine...
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Virtue Gems _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: Believe me, I've tried. We have our own methods of mystical power, to be fair, but your gems remain an enigma. Somehow, I suspect the power is actually inside you, and these 'virtue gems' are just the particular way you believe the world works. I'm no priest, though, so take my opinion for what it's worth.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Virtue Gems _3 - L9 - A1.ogg]]


## Dannig on Introduction /6
Dannig: Ah, a Sorceress in Kingsmarch! What a strange sight. I've heard tales of your kind. My name is Dannig. I am the humble leader of this fair port... and its smith.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _6 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: A Witch in Kingsmarch! Never a good omen. Dark times ahead, I take it.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _6 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: Ah, a fellow blacksmith! You and I must share tales of ancestral bravery over an ale one of these days. I am Dannig, the smith and leader of this fair port.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _6 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: Well, well, a Trarthan! Greetings, Mercenary. You'll find plenty of work here in Kingsmarch, if you're so inclined. I'm Dannig, the smith and leader of this fair port. You may come to me for your equipment needs.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _6 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: Welcome to Kingsm—
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _6 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: Hail. Welcome to Kingsmarch. I am Dannig, the smith and leader of this fair port town.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _6 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: A Monk! Incredible. Monks are a true rarity in Kalguur these days, but that was not always the case. I am interested in learning about your beliefs.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _6 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Oh... I am pleased to meet you, Lord Dannig. You are so... tall. Hmm, I must know... what kind of smithing is that? It's like none I've ever seen.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _6 - L8 - A1.ogg]] ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _6 - L8 - A2.ogg]]

Witch: If I have my way... then yes.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _6 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: I've been away from the flame too long. I could use a bit of home. And that ale.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _6 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: You get enough Trarthans here you recognise one on sight?
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _6 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: I know that kind of fake smile. No need for blustering introductions. I'm not here to make friends.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _6 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Greetings, Dannig. I'm a mountainborn, of the Azmeri... or rather, I {was}.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _6 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: The Dreamer guides all who are willing to see.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _6 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: Observant! Yes, I'm a bit more than a blacksmith. I am also skilled in runecraft.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _6 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: Oh? Planning to bring doom and death to us all, are you? Just another day in Wraeclast.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _6 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: You are most welcome at my forge any time. If you're around long enough, I'll even teach you the art of runecraft. Takes a couple years to learn, though.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _6 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: We've had one or two show up over the years... caused us a fair amount of trouble. You're not still involved in the Death Trades, are you?
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _6 - L18 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: It's not entirely fake. I'm just getting tired as the years wear on, you know?
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _6 - L19 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: Ouch. That's a pain I recognise. You know, we can't exactly go home, either. If you ever want to grab an ale and talk about it, feel free to stop by.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _6 - L20 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: The Dreamer? Is that one of Wraeclast's 'gods?'
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _6 - L21 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Runecraft. Oh, it sounds like such beautiful sorcery. Do tell me its tale.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _6 - L22 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: I suppose I do need to save the world before I conquer it.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _6 - L23 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: If I survive the coming days, that would be an intriguing challenge.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _6 - L24 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: No more than the next weapon-for-hire.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _6 - L25 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Such is the way of things.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _6 - L26 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: I might do just that.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _6 - L27 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: No. But we can talk about that another time. I am compelled to continue on with haste.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _6 - L28 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: Oh, it's not sorcery. It's science, taught to me by priests in my younger days. But enough about me. You're as far from home as we are... more or less. We should exchange tales over an ale sometime soon!
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _6 - L29 - A1.ogg]] ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _6 - L29 - A2.ogg]]

Dannig: I thought so. Let me know when you begin your {'evil crusade'} and perhaps I'll get up an hour early to stop you.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _6 - L30 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: Then it's all settled. Welcome to Kingsmarch!
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _6 - L31 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: Fair enough.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _6 - L32 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: So it is. Well, I'm the smith here, as you can tell. If you need anything, let me know.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _6 - L33 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: Of course. Right. Uh, this is Kingsmarch, I am Dannig, smith and leader of this fair port town. Come to me for your equipment needs.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _6 - L34 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: It's a date.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _6 - L35 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: I will.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _6 - L36 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: I shall.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Introduction _6 - L37 - A1.ogg]]


## Dannig on The Karui /3
Dannig: Our trade with the Karui fluctuates. There are so many tribes with different beliefs and different propensities... some days, we're all profiting. Other days, they're raiding our shipping lanes.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on The Karui _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Sounds about right.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on The Karui _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Do they not feel the Spirit? No unity? Strange.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on The Karui _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: This imperfect world makes monsters of us all, given enough time.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on The Karui _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: This type of situation is common in the Vastiri. The strong tend to do as they please.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on The Karui _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: Shameful behaviour.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on The Karui _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: It never changes. Warlords vying for power.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on The Karui _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: The Tukohama Tribe, the largest in the region, welcomed us at first. We got along very well. Too well. When some of their younger members became interested in Kingsmarch, their Chieftain, Tavakai, began to see us a little differently.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on The Karui _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]


## Dannig on The King /3
Dannig: The King commissioned this port for trade {after} we'd been operating it as an outpost for many years. We ourselves would like to investigate the remnants of our own culture, but he is... ... very interested in Vaal artefacts.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on The King _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Dannig - Dannig on The King _3 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Dannig - Dannig on The King _3 - L1 - A3.ogg]]

Ranger: A mistake men of power often seem to repeat. What's {his} goal?
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on The King _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Doesn't he know the danger Vaal artefacts bring?
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on The King _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: And why is that?
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on The King _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Ominous. Any idea why?
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on The King _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: How strange. Why is he wasting his time with the remnants of a dead Empire? Seems all Kings obsess over ridiculous things.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on The King _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: The Vaal? Why?
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on The King _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: That's right foolish! What's he up to?
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on The King _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: Your guess is as good as mine.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on The King _3 - L9 - A1.ogg]]


## Dannig on Kingsmarch /3
Dannig: This little jewel on the sea might have been granted an official charter by the King, but it's those of us here on Wraeclast that have built it into the trading hub it is today.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Kingsmarch _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: I suppose I've seen worse.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Kingsmarch _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Never seen anything like it.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Kingsmarch _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: You should be proud of what you have built here.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Kingsmarch _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: I suppose there's really nothing to criticise. It's... fine.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Kingsmarch _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: It has a... charm, I suppose. Though it does make me homesick for the Vastiri. Still, it is impressive what you have built.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Kingsmarch _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: It reminds me of home. You've done well here.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Kingsmarch _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Reminds me a bit of Korathin. I mean that as a compliment.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Kingsmarch _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: To be fair, we did have local help...
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Kingsmarch _3 - L9 - A1.ogg]]


## Dannig on Oriath /2
Dannig: Win or lose, you're about to weave a glorious tale. Make sure you come back in one piece, so you can tell it to me.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Oriath _2 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Dannig - Dannig on Oriath _2 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

Ranger: Corruption must not be allowed to spread!
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Oriath _2 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Aye. I will.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Oriath _2 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: If I am led here once more, I'll make a point of it.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Oriath _2 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Oh trust me, I'm sure you'll hear all about it.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Oriath _2 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Seems the duty of a tale-woman might find me after all. I will definitely be back for you someday, Lord Dannig.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Oriath _2 - L6 - A1.ogg]] ![[Dannig - Dannig on Oriath _2 - L6 - A2.ogg]]

Warrior: Yes. I will go there with haste.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Oriath _2 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Isn't that big a deal, mate. Just doing what I gotta do.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Oriath _2 - L8 - A1.ogg]]


## Dannig on The Weapon /2
Dannig: The situation has become dire. But we will aid you in any way that we can. First priority has to be saving the Tukohama Tribe. This region has suffered from their dreaded blood fever before. This could be a disaster...
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on The Weapon _2 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Dannig - Dannig on The Weapon _2 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Dannig - Dannig on The Weapon _2 - L1 - A3.ogg]]


## Dannig on Runes /3
Dannig: The runes on our armour essentially capture and shape starlight. Sounds poetic, but don't be fooled. The smiths of the Kalguur turned these runes toward killing work long ago, as soon as we discovered we could compel arrows to find their mark and blades to bite deeper.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Runes _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: I've never seen runes with such power. Can they really do all that?
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Runes _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: The Spirit has never spoken to us of such things. These runes, do they really do all that?
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Runes _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Some of our teachings mention such runes, but they suggest avoiding them. Do runes really hold power of that sort?
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Runes _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]] ![[Dannig - Dannig on Runes _3 - L4 - A2.ogg]]

Witch: I'm always interested in learning a new thing or two. Can runes really do that?
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Runes _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I hang on these words. Remarkable. And you, Lord Dannig, can do this? I am in awe. Tell me, can runes truly accomplish such things?
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Runes _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]] ![[Dannig - Dannig on Runes _3 - L6 - A2.ogg]]

Warrior: The Ezomytes also smith runes, but not with such power. Can your runes truly do all that?
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Runes _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Well that sounds downright useful. Can runes really do all that?
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Runes _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: All that, and more. The greatest smiths became known as artificers, and produced work of singular genius. I'm not quite there yet, but it's only a matter of time and determination.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Runes _3 - L9 - A1.ogg]]


## Dannig on The Triskelion Flame /5
Dannig: The most powerful artefact in our known tales was brought to this continent by the first expedition thousands of years ago. The songs tell of it incinerating evil, purifying tainted fields, and warding off those of ill intent.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on The Triskelion Flame _5 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: That sounds like our fable of the Runic Triquetra. If it was actually real, it would make a tremendous difference.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on The Triskelion Flame _5 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Our stories mention your people havin' that. It'd be a powerful weapon in this fight.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on The Triskelion Flame _5 - L3 - A1.ogg]] ![[Dannig - Dannig on The Triskelion Flame _5 - L3 - A2.ogg]]

Monk: This would be a fortuitous time for such an artifact to resurface.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on The Triskelion Flame _5 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: I'm intrigued. That thing sounds rather useful for our current situation.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on The Triskelion Flame _5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I can incinerate evil myself, but purification... Wraeclast could use that.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on The Triskelion Flame _5 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: If Ogham had possessed something like that... well, we still need it, even now.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on The Triskelion Flame _5 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Sounds like a fae tale, but I'll take anything, considering what we're up against.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on The Triskelion Flame _5 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: My thoughts exactly. I still intend to get out there - I just get bogged down by the work of running Kingsmarch...
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on The Triskelion Flame _5 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Life is too short to live it passively.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on The Triskelion Flame _5 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Aye, you're an Elder now... no offense.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on The Triskelion Flame _5 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: All paths have detours. You should get back on the trail.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on The Triskelion Flame _5 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Let the weaklings {administrate.} Stop wasting time.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on The Triskelion Flame _5 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: The burden of leadership usually falls on the unwilling. It is a sign of your virtue. I admire you for this.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on The Triskelion Flame _5 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: Trust me. The hour is always later than you think.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on The Triskelion Flame _5 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: If there's one thing that grinds a man down more than anything else, it's paperwork.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on The Triskelion Flame _5 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: One day, there will be a glorious return! One day, we Grand Four will finish our quest, and perhaps do a little saving of this fair Wraeclast. Yes. One day. Soon.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on The Triskelion Flame _5 - L17 - A1.ogg]]


## Dannig on Spike Forging /4
Dannig: Freya Hartlin's still around, and trapped on Journey's End? How strange... I believe I know the runes that could break that seal.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Spike Forging _4 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Forge them and I'll return with Freya.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Spike Forging _4 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Hop to it, will ya? She's not gettin' any younger.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Spike Forging _4 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Time is of the essence, smith.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Spike Forging _4 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: I think... something's quite off with her.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Spike Forging _4 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I must hurry. I trust you, Lord Dannig. I beg you, do your best work for me.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Spike Forging _4 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: Strange things are all I see of late.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Spike Forging _4 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: C'mon then. Lady's waitin'.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Spike Forging _4 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: Wraeclast has always been full of surprises. So be it. I'll forge those spikes with haste.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Spike Forging _4 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: There we go. That should do it. Be careful out there.

## Dannig on Realmgate /1
Dannig: You've collected enough Runic Splinters for me to track the Triskelion Flame's unique signature! I've mapped it out. Use these in the Realmgate to open the path. If I was twenty years younger, I'd go with you, but too many people rely on me now. It's up to you, then. Gird yourself, hero. You're about to make history!

## Dannig on Runic Splinters /3
Dannig: You've found a Runic Splinter, eh? Let me take a look. Ah, yes! This is a sliver of the Triskelion Flame itself! Our first proof it truly is on Wraeclast!
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Runic Splinters _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Dannig - Dannig on Runic Splinters _3 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

Ranger: The Runic Triquetra actually exists...
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Runic Splinters _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Glad I picked it up, then.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Runic Splinters _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Intriguing. What of the rest of it?
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Runic Splinters _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: A piece of it, anyway.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Runic Splinters _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: History is alive in our very hands! What a journey we share.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Runic Splinters _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: This is good news.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Runic Splinters _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: You... you weren't sure it was on Wraeclast?
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Runic Splinters _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: It's not {great} that a piece came off, but it's tiny, and the artefact itself was quite large. Nothing I can't repair. If you find enough of these, I could use their runic signature to determine the location of the Flame. These might lead us straight there!

## Dannig on Olroth /5
Dannig: You actually defeated Olroth, the legend himself, in a one-on-one battle! This will make for an epic saga!
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Olroth _5 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Yes. But for some reason, the Flame collapsed at the end.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Olroth _5 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: I didn't manage to save the Flame. It were destroyed.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Olroth _5 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: The Flame exerted its last for Olroth. It is no more.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Olroth _5 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: I'm just simply too powerful. The Flame didn't survive. Too bad really.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Olroth _5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: A grand tale indeed... but I am sorry, the Flame was destroyed in the battle.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Olroth _5 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: Yes... it might... but I have to tell you... the Flame disintegrated.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Olroth _5 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Uh, so the mission didn't exactly go as planned. the Flame... it got all... buggered up.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Olroth _5 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: The Triskelion Flame... was destroyed? I need time to fully comprehend this. In any case, the quest is done. At least we finally know the truth of our own history. Great work, hero.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Olroth _5 - L9 - A1.ogg]] ![[Dannig - Dannig on Olroth _5 - L9 - A2.ogg]]

Sorceress: Perhaps when all is said and done, there will be time to make a tale of our own, Lord Dannig.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Olroth _5 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Dannig: I will be waiting.

## Dannig on Perseverance /1
Dannig: So, Olroth indeed has the Triskelion Flame! There's no shame in being defeated by him, of course. He is {the} great hero from history. Let's find more Runic Splinters and try again.

## Dannig on Triskelion Flame /2
Dannig: We meet again! Your exploits inspired us to come out of retirement, so to speak. The Grand Four are once again searching for the Triskelion Flame! Wraeclast could sorely use its power in this time of darkness and despair...
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Triskelion Flame _2 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: I'll help, if I can.
 ![[Dannig - Dannig on Triskelion Flame _2 - L2 - A1.ogg]]
