## Delwyn on Introduction /3
Spirit's breath... It's you. Weren't sure I'd ever see you again after... well, you know. Some said you were dead. Part o' me almost wished it—easier than wonderin' where you went... or how to reckon with what you did.
 ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on Introduction _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on Introduction _3 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

Here to hunt, are ya? That makes two of us. Name's Delwyn. See that there? No, your eyes don't deceive ya. That... is the Spirit. Or at least, a form of it. Don't worry—it means for us to follow. Approach, and the hunt begins.
 ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on Introduction _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]] ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on Introduction _3 - L2 - A2.ogg]] ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on Introduction _3 - L2 - A3.ogg]]

Huntress: You know why I did it—to save our people.
 ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on Introduction _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Aye... and save 'em you did. Just wish it hadn't cost you—us—everythin'. But what's done is done. Now's your chance to make it right. The Spirit is near, or at least... a form of it. Approach, and the hunt begins.

## Delwyn on Azmeri Traditions /5
We always kept to ourselves—never troubled the world, and it never troubled us. Least, not 'til our ancestors took in the Vaal, and folk still bicker over whether that were a mistake.
 ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on Azmeri Traditions _5 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

We Azmeri always kept to ourselves—never troubled the world, and it never troubled us. Least, not 'til our ancestors took in the Vaal, and folk still bicker over whether that were a mistake. But that were then. Now, the Spirit itself calls on us to look beyond our own. Who are we to ignore its will?
 ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on Azmeri Traditions _5 - L2 - A1.ogg]] ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on Azmeri Traditions _5 - L2 - A2.ogg]]

Huntress: I've no love for the Vaal, but if not for their virtue gems, our village would be a smolderin' ruin right now.
 ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on Azmeri Traditions _5 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Aye... and you'd have died an Azmeri rather than an outcast.
 ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on Azmeri Traditions _5 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: You think that preferable?
 ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on Azmeri Traditions _5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Nay. Just a statement o' fact. But that were then. Now, the Spirit calls on us to look beyond our own. Who are we to ignore its will?

## Delwyn on Wisp of the Cunning Fox /3
That were a Wisp o' the Cunning Fox. Aptly named, they are. Any beast they inhabit don't just get stronger—they get meaner, trickier too. We're lucky this turned out as well as it did.

Huntress: Lucky? Speak for yourself.
 ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on Wisp of the Cunning Fox _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Ha—forgive me. Almost forgot who I were dealin' with.
 ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on Wisp of the Cunning Fox _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]


## Delwyn on Wisp of the Spring Hare /3
Reckon that were a Wisp o' the Spring Hare. Wily lil' things, they are—devilishly so. Any beast they inhabit's got a chance o' springin' straight back to life after you've put 'em down... as if there weren't enough o' that goin' around already.

 ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on Wisp of the Spring Hare _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Lovely. Just what this place needs—more things what won't stay dead.
 ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on Wisp of the Spring Hare _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Aye—seems unlike the Spirit, truth be told. But who am I to question?
 ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on Wisp of the Spring Hare _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]


## Delwyn on Greater Manifestations /5
We've always hunted beasts infused with the Spirit—you know that as well as I do. But lately... I've seen wisps unlike the rest. Older, maybe. Stronger. More potent with the Spirit's power.
 ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on Greater Manifestations _5 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

We Azmeri hunt beasts infused with the Spirit. Always have. But... seems there are some wisps that are different. Older, maybe. More potent with the Spirit's power. These are the ones I track—they seek out only the most Corrupted o' beasts. I've seen more and more of 'em lately. Can't say why. But the Spirit clearly means to tell us summat... and I'll be damned if I don't listen.
 ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on Greater Manifestations _5 - L2 - A1.ogg]] ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on Greater Manifestations _5 - L2 - A2.ogg]] ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on Greater Manifestations _5 - L2 - A3.ogg]]

Huntress: Think the Spirit's trying to tell us somethin'?
 ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on Greater Manifestations _5 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

I do. And I'll be damned if I don't listen... Question is, will you?
 ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on Greater Manifestations _5 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: I'm here, aren't I?
 ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on Greater Manifestations _5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Aye. That you are.
 ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on Greater Manifestations _5 - L6 - A1.ogg]]


## Delwyn on The Spirit /7
Seems the Spirit hasn't turned its back on you just yet. I've never known it to manifest so openly. Heard tell of it, aye... but even in the stories, it weren't like this.
 ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on The Spirit _7 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

You've already had your first hunt with the Spirit. Never known it to manifest so openly. Heard tell of it, aye... but even in the stories, it weren't like this. Our elders spoke of a time when the Spirit moved among us, seekin' out {rathin}—Corruption, in the modern tongue—and guidin' our hunters to it so they could cleanse the land. Seems it's doin' the same now... but more often. More urgent. {Rathin's} spreadin'. The Spirit's callin' us to act. Question is... will you answer?
 ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on The Spirit _7 - L2 - A1.ogg]] ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on The Spirit _7 - L2 - A2.ogg]] ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on The Spirit _7 - L2 - A3.ogg]] ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on The Spirit _7 - L2 - A4.ogg]]

Huntress: You think I don't know that?
 ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on The Spirit _7 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

I know you do. Just weren't sure you still cared.
 ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on The Spirit _7 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: 'Course I care. What do you think it means?
 ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on The Spirit _7 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

That's what I aim to find out. In years past, the Spirit sought out {rathin}—led our hunters to it, so they could root it out.
 ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on The Spirit _7 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: That's no small task. Far greater than chasing wisps.
 ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on The Spirit _7 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Aye. The Spirit's no fool. It's drawn to the worst of 'em—the powerful ones. Might be worth your while to hunt such marks. If you're lookin' to redeem yourself... here's your chance.

## Delwyn on Tracking a Wisp /3
Followin' 'em ain't as simple as just keepin' pace. Chase a wisp, you'll find every beast it touches turns meaner, stronger—more ferocious than before.
 ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on Tracking a Wisp _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Followin' 'em ain't as simple as just keepin' pace. Chase a wisp, and you'll find every beast it touches turns meaner, stronger—more ferocious than before. Seems like the {rathin} in 'em don't take kindly to the Spirit's presence—like a fire ragin' hotter when the wind picks up. Regardless, the Spirit always settles on one in particular—that's the real threat—but don't think the rest'll be easy pickings, neither.
 ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on Tracking a Wisp _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]] ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on Tracking a Wisp _3 - L2 - A2.ogg]] ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on Tracking a Wisp _3 - L2 - A3.ogg]]

Huntress: Every beast? Even those it don't possess?
 ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on Tracking a Wisp _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Aye. Seems like the {rathin} in 'em don't take kindly to the Spirit's presence—like a fire ragin' hotter when the wind picks up. Regardless, the Spirit always settles on one in particular—that's the real threat—but don't go ignorin' the rest, neither.

## Delwyn on Forms of the Spirit /3
Most wisps are small flickers o' the Spirit, drawn to {rathin} like moths to flame. But some... some burn brighter, and seek out only the strongest. You'll know 'em by their orange glow—bright as embers in the dark.
 ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on Forms of the Spirit _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on Forms of the Spirit _3 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

Most wisps are small flickers o' the Spirit, drawn to {rathin} like moths to flame. But some... some burn brighter, and seek out only the strongest. You'll know 'em by their orange glow—bright as embers in the dark. They're not easy to bring down... but I reckon you can handle yerself.
 ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on Forms of the Spirit _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]] ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on Forms of the Spirit _3 - L2 - A2.ogg]]

Huntress: More dangerous prey, then. Fine by me.
 ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on Forms of the Spirit _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Aye, they're not so easy to bring down... but I reckon you can handle yourself.
 ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on Forms of the Spirit _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]


## Delwyn on Introduction /1
Delwyn: Welcome to Mount Kriar - not the friendliest peak in the Ranges. Keep your footin', keep your wits... and you might just leave with both in-tact. If not, well... these slopes are littered with folk who made the same mistake.
 ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on Introduction _1 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on Introduction _1 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on Introduction _1 - L1 - A3.ogg]]

Delwyn: Look at you, back in the Ranges... never thought I'd see the day. I won't tell you to watch your step - you know the perils of these peaks better than most. Doubt the Elders would be happy to know you're back. But I won't be the one to tell 'em.

## Delwyn on Doryani /1
Delwyn: Some call him a genius. Others, a monster. The truth is usually somewhere in between. Me? I say power like his comes with a cost... and it's never the one wieldin' it who pays. Remember that the next time you go thinkin' you're on the same side.
 ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on Doryani _1 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on Doryani _1 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on Doryani _1 - L1 - A3.ogg]]

Delwyn: So... you've thrown in with Doryani. Can't say I saw that comin'. You always did walk to the beat o' your own drum. Just hope you know what you're doin'. Men like him... they make poor enemies. And even worse allies.

## Delwyn on Mount Kriar /1
Delwyn: You crested Mount Kriar and lived to tell the tale. Few can claim that - fewer still who ain't Azmeri. I'm sure your path now leads elsewhere... but know you'll always be welcome here.
 ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on Mount Kriar _1 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on Mount Kriar _1 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on Mount Kriar _1 - L1 - A3.ogg]]

Delwyn: There was a time I thought I'd never see you on these mountains again. But Elders be damned - you came back, and stood atop Mount Kriar besides. Whatever road calls you next, know that my hearth will always be open to you.
 ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on Mount Kriar _1 - L2 - A1.ogg]] ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on Mount Kriar _1 - L2 - A2.ogg]] ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on Mount Kriar _1 - L2 - A3.ogg]]


## Delwyn on The Snake /1
Delwyn: I am troubled by stories o' deception... by voices that are not the Spirit. Is there someone out there misleading us? Whisperin' in our ears, leading us to our dooms? It sounds like our stories of the Snake, but of that, I know little. Hasn't troubled us for generations. An Elder would know better than I.
 ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on The Snake _1 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on The Snake _1 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on The Snake _1 - L1 - A3.ogg]] ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on The Snake _1 - L1 - A4.ogg]]


## Delwyn on The Wayward Spear /3
Delwyn: Never seen such a woeful misunderstandin' of the Spirit in all my days. Don't know what possessed her to think she were doin' its work. Spirit never asked me to kill an innocent. And if it did, well... I'd have to question me own sanity.
 ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on The Wayward Spear _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on The Wayward Spear _3 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on The Wayward Spear _3 - L1 - A3.ogg]]

Delwyn: Never thought I'd see the Spirit's name used to justify such butchery. Folk like us know it'd never ask for the blood of an innocent. If it ever did... well, I'd wonder if I'd lost me mind entirely.
 ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on The Wayward Spear _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]] ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on The Wayward Spear _3 - L2 - A2.ogg]] ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on The Wayward Spear _3 - L2 - A3.ogg]]

Delwyn: Don't feel good, puttin' someone down - but don't lose any sleep over it.
 ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on The Wayward Spear _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Delwyn: Don't feel good to kill one o' your own - but don't lose any sleep over it.
 ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on The Wayward Spear _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Delwyn: Truth is, a lotta people are dead because o' her... and now, no more will be.
 ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on The Wayward Spear _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]


## Delwyn on The Wayward Spear /1
Delwyn: I know the one. Once a proud hunter, now lost to madness. Put her kin to the spear 'cause 'the Spirit told her to' - or so she says... More likely the Snake. If you could deal with her, you'd be doin' us all a favour... and probably her, as well.
 ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on The Wayward Spear _1 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on The Wayward Spear _1 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on The Wayward Spear _1 - L1 - A3.ogg]] ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on The Wayward Spear _1 - L1 - A4.ogg]]

Delwyn: Wayward is right. Once a fine hunter... now she's turned her spear on her own. Says the Spirit told her to do it. You and I both know that's not true. Sounds more like the Snake if you ask me... If you face her, make it quick. That's not the Spirit's path she's walkin'... and hasn't been for a long time.
 ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on The Wayward Spear _1 - L2 - A1.ogg]] ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on The Wayward Spear _1 - L2 - A2.ogg]] ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on The Wayward Spear _1 - L2 - A3.ogg]] ![[Delwyn - Delwyn on The Wayward Spear _1 - L2 - A4.ogg]]
