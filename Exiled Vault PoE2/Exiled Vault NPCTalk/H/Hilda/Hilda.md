## Hilda on Howling Winds /1
Hilda: There's one beast I've not been able to best. A yeti deep within the caves of Mount Kriar. A truly fearsome bastard! Many claim to have seen him, just not up close... One thing is certain though, you'll hear him! Oh, an unmistakable howl against the icy winds. Seek him out, slay him and bring me his tusks. I'll make it worth yer while!

## Hilda on Introduction /1
Hilda: Good day to ya. I'm Hilda. Been roaming the world for some time now, hunting all manner of beasts... And as soon as I get my arse back to Mount Kriar... it's all turned to shite! My tribe has fled the region. Someone was roughin' them up. I got one guess who. Lythara, a skilled hunter from a neighbouring tribe, has lost her mind. She and her followers drove my people out, then she turned on her own. I'd sort her out myself, but she packs quite a punch. If you're headin' up the mountain, you'll have to deal with her... ...but there's somethin' else I'd ask of ya.

## Hilda on The Spirit /1
Hilda: Alright then, ya nosy blighter! Let me tell it as it is. I'm a hunter, aye. I run the woods, the fields and I've tracked many beasts. Yet I've never heard a voice, or saw a light leading me. It's always been just me, alone. The Spirit stayed silent when my dear brother lay starving. Nor did it light up the night when my ailing mother was lost to the wilderness. Even if it does exist, what use is it, in a world brimmin' with pain and misery? For nothin'!

## Hilda on Oriath /1
Hilda: You movin' on? Aye, I should as well. Good luck with that, uh, Ori... Oriearth and whatnot. Should ya end up blowin' yourselves up again, try to escape back this way maybe!

## Hilda on The Spirit /1
Hilda: The 'Spirit' is a load of codswallop, if you ask me. I've nothing more to say on it.
 ![[Hilda - Hilda on The Spirit _1 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Hilda: Best not ask me about that codswallop, friend. I fear you'll not think too kindly about what I have to say...

## Hilda on The Vaal /1
Hilda: There's {living} Vaal in Mount Kriar? Well, I'll be damned. The stories are true! It's not some children's tale from the Elders, but a yarn we weave on the winter solstice. Many generations ago, a Vaal named Uromoti came to us and wanted to 'buy' a mountain from the Azmeri. You can't {buy} a mountain! It's nonsense! They simply exist! So, we let him pass. Countless Vaal marched up there, trying to capture Mount Kriar. Well they busied themselves, certainly, as eventually, they went silent. We assumed they died up there, trying to 'buy' the mountain from the sky! Perhaps they did make a deal, but with Prospero instead... Ugh, he'd be the type to sell you a mountain.

## Hilda on The Yeti /1
Hilda: Been huntin' that Yeti in the proper season, these last five years. Oh, he's a shifty one. I follow his howl, but I think he knows. I think he's got... {the sense.} I bet he feels the hair on his neck stand up when I'm on his trail. He'll never feel {you} comin' though. Doesn't know your scent!

## Hilda on Ice Tusks /1
Hilda: Well, look at you then! Quite the hunter. Oh, these will fit in nicely with my trophy collection. I thank ya. Perhaps we can work together again sometime.

Hilda: Of course! I never doubted ya, mountain-born. Oh, these will fit in nicely with my trophy collection. I thank ya. Perhaps we can work together again sometime.
