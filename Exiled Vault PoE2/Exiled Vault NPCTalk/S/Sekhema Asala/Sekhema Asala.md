## Sekhema Asala on Travel to the Sandswept Marsh /1
Desert Map: Yes, we can take you to the edge of the desert. Then, we will continue to track the Beast. You {must} find a way to contain it. When we find out where it is being taken, we will seek you out. Until then, may the winds ever be calm on your path.

## Sekhema Asala on Gifting of Water /3
Sekhema Asala: My attempt at unification has not gone smoothly. As a people, we are... stubborn.
 ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on Gifting of Water _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Sekhema Asala: I'm sure you know this better than anyone.
 ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on Gifting of Water _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Sekhema Asala: The Gifting of Water is an opportunity to air grievances and heal old wounds. It takes place at the last reservoir of the original Seven Waters. The last true remnant of Keth's glory days. If I am to enlist the other {akharas} in this war, I must do so at this ritual. The fact that they have chosen me to do this means they are at least open to moving forward.

## Sekhema Asala on Ready for War /1
Sekhema Asala: This will be a war for the very soul of Wraeclast. I can imagine no greater battle, no greater cause. If we are to die... ... we will die {well}.

## Sekhema Asala on The Envoy /6
Sekhema Asala: Did our scouts find you?
 ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on The Envoy _6 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Sekhema Asala: It is good to see you.
 ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on The Envoy _6 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: No, I returned to seek your aid. We must assault Oriath, to slay the Beast.
 ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on The Envoy _6 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Scouts? No. The Beast is in Oriath, and it's time we did something about it.
 ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on The Envoy _6 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Likewise. I have discovered that the Beast is in Oriath, and we must wage war.
 ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on The Envoy _6 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: You had scouts looking for me? The Beast is in Oriath. We must go.
 ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on The Envoy _6 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: I am not so easily found. We must get to Oriath. The Beast is there.
 ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on The Envoy _6 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Not possible. I've been on the sea. The Beast has been taken to Oriath.
 ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on The Envoy _6 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Might have. Not sure. I've come to ask your aid once again, boss. The Beast... it's in Oriath.
 ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on The Envoy _6 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Sekhema Asala: Yes. We have learned this as well, and have been looking for you. Your return is timely. I am making moves to gather the {akharas} for war, but they will not follow my leadership unless this goes well. This year, because of what I am attempting to do, it has become my duty to oversee the Gifting of Water. In the city of Qimah, the {akharas} gather at the appointed time, as marked by the skies. There, we divide sacred water. We 'keep the river flowing,' as it is said. The same waters that once flowed through Keth.

Warrior: A powerful tradition. How can I help?
 ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on The Envoy _6 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Hmm. And something's not going according to plan, I take it?
 ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on The Envoy _6 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I am familiar. Is there a problem?
 ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on The Envoy _6 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Am I to play some role in this?
 ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on The Envoy _6 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: I can respect that. You sound concerned, though.
 ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on The Envoy _6 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: A symbol of unity. What can I do?
 ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on The Envoy _6 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: That's all above my head. What's my job?
 ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on The Envoy _6 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Sekhema Asala: The {sel khari}, the sacred guardians of the First {Barya}, have not arrived... Three nights before the Gifting, they are to bring the {Barya} here. We cannot find them, nor have we received word. It is not mere chance that this has happened at such a time... there is an enemy at work. I am not permitted to know where the {sel khari} live. Zarka, can you entrust this knowledge to an outsider?
 ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on The Envoy _6 - L18 - A1.ogg]] ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on The Envoy _6 - L18 - A2.ogg]] ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on The Envoy _6 - L18 - A3.ogg]] ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on The Envoy _6 - L18 - A4.ogg]]

Zarka: Yes, in times of need. This surely qualifies. You earned our trust by your care and service at Deshar. Come closer, young one. I must speak to you privately.

## Sekhema Asala on The First Barya /13
Sekhema Asala: What happened to the {sel khari}?! Who are you?! I should slay you where you stand!
 ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on The First Barya _13 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Jado: I am Jado... Now, stay your blade! I am not your enemy!
 ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on The First Barya _13 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Sekhema Asala: As {Sekhema} of the Ardura, I demand you explain yourself!
 ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on The First Barya _13 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Jado: Very well... we learned that someone was planning an attack on the Gifting of Water. I infiltrated the {sel khari} to protect the First {Barya}.
 ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on The First Barya _13 - L4 - A1.ogg]] ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on The First Barya _13 - L4 - A2.ogg]]

Sekhema Asala: Who is this 'we'?
 ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on The First Barya _13 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Jado: The... Order of the Djinn.
 ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on The First Barya _13 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Sekhema Asala: So... Zarka's suspicions are true. You {have} started to replenish your ranks. Who attacked you?
 ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on The First Barya _13 - L7 - A1.ogg]] ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on The First Barya _13 - L7 - A2.ogg]]

Jado: A rogue sect of Faridun who stand against you. Their leader calls himself 'Prince Azmadi.'
 ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on The First Barya _13 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Sekhema Asala: More false titles! How did you let a pack of stray dogs best you?
 ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on The First Barya _13 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Jado: They had help... from the Serpent Clan.
 ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on The First Barya _13 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Sekhema Asala: Of course! They swore vengeance for the death of their Queen at Keth.
 ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on The First Barya _13 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Jado: Even then, I should have been able to hold them off. But Azmadi... he had strange abilities... powers beyond his own... He invoked the name Zarokh... They've taken the First {Barya}, and they left in the direction of Qimah.
 ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on The First Barya _13 - L12 - A1.ogg]] ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on The First Barya _13 - L12 - A2.ogg]] ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on The First Barya _13 - L12 - A3.ogg]] ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on The First Barya _13 - L12 - A4.ogg]]

Sekhema Asala: Then we must give chase! Come, let us return to my {akhara}.
 ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on The First Barya _13 - L13 - A1.ogg]]


## Sekhema Asala on Faridun Prince /1
Sekhema Asala: Jamanra was a worthy opponent, and was given a warrior's death. This 'Azmadi' is a craven dog, assaulting our traditions directly. He will not receive recognition when he dies.
 ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on Faridun Prince _1 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on Faridun Prince _1 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on Faridun Prince _1 - L1 - A3.ogg]]


## Sekhema Asala on Jado /1
Sekhema Asala: I have not yet decided whether I support this rebuilding of the Order of the Djinn. The Maraketh are already committed to protecting the world. {I} am already committed. It is dangerous to have a rogue element operating unseen... no matter how well-intentioned they may be.
 ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on Jado _1 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on Jado _1 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on Jado _1 - L1 - A3.ogg]]


## Sekhema Asala on Rashi /1
Sekhema Asala: To keep the reserves from running dry, Rashi collects water from the winds throughout the seasons. She inhabits the First {Barya}. The {sel khari} bring her to us. We take her to the sacred site, and Rashi bleeds what she gathered. In this way, we replenish our reserves. Rashi is not a criminal, like so many others bound to {baryas.} She chose this duty. She could choose to move on at any time; to pass the burden to another. She has not yet done so. It is a grim and solemn duty. Each time she is bled of water... her screams are haunting. This existence, alone in all that I have seen in this world, I do not believe I could endure. She has my utmost respect.
 ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on Rashi _1 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on Rashi _1 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on Rashi _1 - L1 - A3.ogg]] ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on Rashi _1 - L1 - A4.ogg]] ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on Rashi _1 - L1 - A5.ogg]] ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on Rashi _1 - L1 - A6.ogg]] ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on Rashi _1 - L1 - A7.ogg]]


## Sekhema Asala on Sel Khari /2
Sekhema Asala: Did you abandon your tale-woman duties before they taught you this?
 ![[Sekhema Asala - Sekhema Asala on Sel Khari _2 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Sekhema Asala: Long ago, when the bounty of the land began to shift against us, we enacted traditions that would safeguard the future. Each {akhara} sends one {dekhara} per generation to the {sel khari}. Thus, they are loyal to all, and to none. They watch over vast underground reserves that were built in Keth's fading days. For countless generations, the Gifting of Water meant pouring water {into} the reserves. Now, in this era of thirst and heat, we are given what our forebears set aside for us. When I drink, it is from water given to me by my mother, and her mother before her. Their sacrifice. Their resolve. The Grand Water Djinn, Rashi, is crucial to maintaining these reserves... which is why the {sel khari's} absence is so concerning.

## Sekhema Asala on Kingsmarch /1
Sekhema Asala: The Gifting of Water went well. We are ready. I will make preparations. We shall meet you in Kingsmarch.
