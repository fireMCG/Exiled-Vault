Servitor Marius: It strikes me, you know... the Azmeri really have no need of our teachings.
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Culture _6 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: What are you sayin' to me right now?
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Culture _6 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Servitor Marius: You already live in a sort of Utopia. In harmony. What else could we possibly teach you?
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Culture _6 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Oh. Unexpected. True enough, though. I wish I could go home.
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Culture _6 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Servitor Marius: You can't go home? Perhaps you could find a place here, with us.
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Culture _6 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: We'll see.
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Culture _6 - L6 - A1.ogg]]


## Servitor Marius on Culture /3
Servitor Marius: There are not many Ezomytes joining us. Most won't even listen. What is it that compels them to resist our message?
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Culture _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Culture _3 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

Ranger: We don't like being told what to do.
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Culture _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Hahah! You'll never meet anyone more irrepressible.
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Culture _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Servitor Marius: Ah, the spirit of rebellion burns strong in Ezomyte blood. We could use that in the new world... just not pointed in our direction.

 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Introduction _6 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: Aren't we all?
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Introduction _6 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Redemption? I've no need for redemption, dear.
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Introduction _6 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Hope could be what helps us save the world.
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Introduction _6 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Well, that was brutal. I don't think I am, no.
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Introduction _6 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: I seek the Spirit. Only in that, can I have my forgiveness.
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Introduction _6 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: No. The Dreamer has {already} enlightened me.
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Introduction _6 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Hang on...
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Introduction _6 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Servitor Marius: Sometimes we are blind to our own reflection. But there is hope for you. Pledge yourself to a higher destiny!
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Introduction _6 - L17 - A1.ogg]] ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Introduction _6 - L17 - A2.ogg]]

Servitor Marius: You are very wise. Yes, indeed. You could be a part of that future. Pledge yourself to a shining horizon!
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Introduction _6 - L18 - A1.ogg]] ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Introduction _6 - L18 - A2.ogg]]

 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Introduction _6 - L22 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: No, no... hang on. Degenerate?
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Introduction _6 - L23 - A1.ogg]]

Servitor Marius: We are willing to absolve your past self of his crimes! In his place will stand a new man. Pledge yourself to a fresh start!

## Servitor Marius on Culture /4
Servitor Marius: The Karui are strong, but their youth are thirsting for change. The Way meant survival in the old world. It will not be needed in Utopia.
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Culture _4 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Culture _4 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

Marauder: The Elders won't be happy about that.
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Culture _4 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Servitor Marius: Well, they never are.
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Culture _4 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Marauder: Hah! You're not wrong.
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Culture _4 - L4 - A1.ogg]]


## Servitor Marius on Culture /6
Servitor Marius: The Maraketh are a vibrant success story. Harsh traditions kept them alive for eons in a brutal world. You won't need to be so militant in our Utopia.
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Culture _6 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Culture _6 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Culture _6 - L1 - A3.ogg]]

Sorceress: What if I {prefer} being 'militant?'
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Culture _6 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Servitor Marius: Oh... well... you don't have to stay in Utopia. I suppose you could always sail to Kalguur. Perhaps their way of life would suit you better.
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Culture _6 - L3 - A1.ogg]] ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Culture _6 - L3 - A2.ogg]]

Sorceress: That's it? You're not going to try to convince me?
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Culture _6 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Servitor Marius: Young lady, I'm not a preacher. More of a... realist idealist. If Utopia doesn't work for you, you're not a prisoner.
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Culture _6 - L5 - A1.ogg]] ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Culture _6 - L5 - A2.ogg]]

Sorceress: I suppose that's fair.
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Culture _6 - L6 - A1.ogg]]


## Servitor Marius on Culture /6
Servitor Marius: You need not waste my time, covenite. I know you don't truly intend to listen.
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Culture _6 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: What gave it away?
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Culture _6 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Servitor Marius: Whether you appreciate it or not, we're building Utopia for you, too. We will lift your pain, and absolve that which drives you to dark magics.
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Culture _6 - L3 - A1.ogg]] ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Culture _6 - L3 - A2.ogg]]

Witch: I like my pain, thank you. It's what drives me ever forward, a relentless whip at my heels.
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Culture _6 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Servitor Marius: I see. You have no home, no friends, not even a pet - not a living one, anyway. You fear you would be nothing, if not for your ambition.
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Culture _6 - L5 - A1.ogg]] ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Culture _6 - L5 - A2.ogg]]

Witch: Shut your mouth, old man, before I rip it out.
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Culture _6 - L6 - A1.ogg]]


## Servitor Marius on Pledge /3
Servitor Marius: Yes! The pledge is something we take very seriously. It is a commitment. A commitment to yourself, and to Utopia. All we ask is that you join us wholeheartedly, without fear. Doubt is natural, and we will answer all your questions. Leaving only pure determination toward the betterment of the world!
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Pledge _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Pledge _3 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Pledge _3 - L1 - A3.ogg]] ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Pledge _3 - L1 - A4.ogg]] ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Pledge _3 - L1 - A5.ogg]]

Warrior: I will listen... but I cannot promise more than that.
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Pledge _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: I'm not trying to better the world. I'm trying to {conquer} it.
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Pledge _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I {am} looking for a place in this world... but I'm not sure this is it. Still, share your tale.
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Pledge _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: My home is littered with the rusted consequences of such hubris.
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Pledge _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: I'm already pledged to the Spirit, but we should work together.
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Pledge _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: My allegiance lies {fully} elsewhere.
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Pledge _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: It's a cult, mate. It's definitely a cult. But... cults can be fun.
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Pledge _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Servitor Marius: You need not decide immediately, of course. Dine with us. Come to know us. We always say: you arrive a stranger on Arastas, but remain as a friend. The pledge can come later. For now, how about tithing?
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Pledge _3 - L9 - A1.ogg]] ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Pledge _3 - L9 - A2.ogg]] ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Pledge _3 - L9 - A3.ogg]] ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Pledge _3 - L9 - A4.ogg]]


## Servitor Marius on Plight /2
Warrior: I'd just like to hear {you} speak more about this place.
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Plight _2 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Come now... cat got your tongue?
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Plight _2 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: You can tell me nothing substantial?
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Plight _2 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: You don't like questions, do you?
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Plight _2 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: What's wrong? You can't tell me nothing?
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Plight _2 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: You fear something. I can sense it.
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Plight _2 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: What's going on? What you worried about?
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Plight _2 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Servitor Marius: A servitor knows his place. Utopia awaits!
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Plight _2 - L8 - A1.ogg]]


## Servitor Marius on Plight /1
Servitor Marius: I can take your pledge, or a tithing. No more, no less.
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Plight _1 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Plight _1 - L1 - A2.ogg]]


## Servitor Marius on Tithe /5
Servitor Marius: Tithing is a noble action indeed. Your support would be much appreciated.
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Tithe _5 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: What would I be supporting with this tithe?
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Tithe _5 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Oh look. Now he wants coin.
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Tithe _5 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: You want me to pay you? For what?
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Tithe _5 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: You just have to have {something}, don't you?
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Tithe _5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: I might have a spare coin or two... wait, what even is it you're doing?
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Tithe _5 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: I hesitate to invest in your ideas. I am not even sure what they are.
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Tithe _5 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Are you kiddin' me?
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Tithe _5 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Servitor Marius: We will gladly educate you about our cause.
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Tithe _5 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Servitor Marius: Lorandis, our missionary, will happily fill you in. I'm sure he'll visit Kingsmarch soon enough.
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Tithe _5 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Servitor Marius: You should seek the counsel of our missionary, Lorandis, once more.
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Tithe _5 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Servitor Marius: He can speak to the details of our plight better than I.
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Tithe _5 - L12 - A1.ogg]]


## Servitor Marius on Culture /4
Servitor Marius: Trarthans are the lowest scum this world has to offer. The throw-aways of Wraeclast. Cast in the image of crassness and treachery.
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Culture _4 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Culture _4 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

Mercenary: Watch it. I'm Trarthan.
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Culture _4 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Servitor Marius: Or so I've heard, from the Eternal Empire's histories. Not my opinions. Just from the scholars of the time.
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Culture _4 - L3 - A1.ogg]] ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Culture _4 - L3 - A2.ogg]]

Mercenary: Ehh I'm just gettin' your goat! You're spot on. We're a bunch of arseholes, and proud of it!
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Culture _4 - L4 - A1.ogg]] ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Culture _4 - L4 - A2.ogg]]


## Servitor Marius on Culture /4
Servitor Marius: You bear an odd mix of tattoos. A few Karui, most Ezomyte, one or two Oriathan slave marks. What is your tale, I wonder?
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Culture _4 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Culture _4 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Culture _4 - L1 - A3.ogg]]

Warrior: I wish I knew. I was found on the shores of Ogham by my father.
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Culture _4 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Servitor Marius: Ahh... there were many shipwrecks and tragedies when Oriath fell. It's possible your ancestry is lost to time. Supposedly, the Karui can speak to their ancestors. Perhaps you should ask them.
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Culture _4 - L3 - A1.ogg]] ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Culture _4 - L3 - A2.ogg]] ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Culture _4 - L3 - A3.ogg]]

Warrior: I might just do that... if they'll listen.
 ![[Servitor Marius - Servitor Marius on Culture _4 - L4 - A1.ogg]]
