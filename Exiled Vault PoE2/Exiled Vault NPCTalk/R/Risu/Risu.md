## Risu on Clearing the Way /1
Risu: The other {akharas} must join the Gifting of Water if Asala is to become {Sekhema} of {Sekhemas}. The land is still plagued by the passing of the Beast. They cannot get through. May I ask you, my friend, to journey out to the other end of the Khari Crossing? The way is plagued by a great scorpion and a massive sandworm, both crazed by Corruption. Slay them, so that the others can reach us.

## Risu on Welcome Back /1
Risu: Welcome back, my friend! I have been studying under Zarka, to become a tale-woman. I now live in better conditions than I could ever have hoped for, and I owe it all to Asala. And to you! I tease! We do have serious business, however.

## Risu on Asala /1
Risu: One day, we will number enough to make Asala divine. Praise be to that day! She will bring rains to the Vastiri, and glory to our people!

## Risu on Better Conditions /1
Risu: The Ardura sleep wherever we must, like rice scattered in baskets, but I have my own pillow now. Have you ever had a pillow? It's incredible! Truly, these are the times of glory! Praise Asala!

## Risu on Oriath /1
Risu: I know nothing of this 'Oriath,' but if you need us, we will answer. If I am to die in this war, I will do so gladly, as part of a family.

## Risu on Zarka /1
Risu: She has given me a fair chance to catch up. Others want to be the next tale-woman, but it will go to the one who proves herself. I am more motivated. It will be me! It must be me. I owe her that.
