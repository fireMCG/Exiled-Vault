## Ruhaki on Matiki /1
Ruhaki: I knew I liked you. Thank you for saving Matiki. He's my favourite Elder! He never punished me... not that I ever did anything wrong... You know what, I think I could even budge on some of my prices... Just for you though!

## Ruhaki on Introduction /1
Ruhaki: Hail! That's what you outsiders say, right? I thought I heard the clink of gold in your pocket... I'm Ruhaki. I'm an apprentice carver here on Ngakanu. I'd be keen to trade for some of that gold of yours... Seeing as you freed my favourite Elder, I'll even give you a discount.
