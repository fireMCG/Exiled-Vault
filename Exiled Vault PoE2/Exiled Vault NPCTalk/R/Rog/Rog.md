## Rog on Grand Quest /1
Rog, the Dealer: The grand quest that brought me here? Oh, no, that's a long story. I couldn't possibly.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Grand Quest _1 - L1 - A1.ogg]]


## Rog on Kalguurans /4
Rog, the Dealer: What is it you want to know about us?
 ![[Rog - Rog on Kalguurans _4 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Just tell me your roles, so I can understand how this place functions.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Kalguurans _4 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: What do you all do in this grand stone village?
 ![[Rog - Rog on Kalguurans _4 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: What is life like here?
 ![[Rog - Rog on Kalguurans _4 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: I don't know. I don't do small talk.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Kalguurans _4 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: We all have a tale. I want to know what makes you, you.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Kalguurans _4 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: What do you do here? I've never seen a village this large.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Kalguurans _4 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: How does one make money around here?
 ![[Rog - Rog on Kalguurans _4 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Rog, the Dealer: Fair enough. I'm terrible at it, too.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Kalguurans _4 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Rog, the Dealer: Well, most Kalguurans here on Wraeclast are in various guilds. I'm in the Meridian Free Traders, the trade guild that owns the charter for Kingsmarch. You can't beat our logistics! Dannig is in the Artificers' Guild these days. Tujen's a freelance harbourmaster, but he stays close. You gotta keep the family together, you know? The wife's the only one still carrying on our grand quest... I sure do miss her... but she always comes back soon enough. On an unrelated note... the King's Hand is due to return to Kalguur any day now... take care if you see {him} around.

## Rog on The King /3
Rog, the Dealer: There is no greater concentration of loyal followers of the King than here in Kingsmarch... know what I mean, {friend?}
 ![[Rog - Rog on The King _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: I understand. I recently became a very loyal and dedicated follower of my own Count. {Friend}.
 ![[Rog - Rog on The King _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: I like you. You're funny, fat one.
 ![[Rog - Rog on The King _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: This King of yours would do well to stay away, lest he end up skinned.
 ![[Rog - Rog on The King _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: I'm not your {friend}, Kalguuran.
 ![[Rog - Rog on The King _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: I feel like I'm missing somethin'.
 ![[Rog - Rog on The King _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Loyalty and dedication are valuable traits to have.
 ![[Rog - Rog on The King _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Heh heh, I catch your drift, {friend.} I'm always in for a {good cause.}
 ![[Rog - Rog on The King _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Rog, the Dealer: It's always good to meet a new {friend.} Let's keep in touch.
 ![[Rog - Rog on The King _3 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Rog, the Dealer: Oh, wow... that's rather direct... you and I should keep in touch.
 ![[Rog - Rog on The King _3 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Rog, the Dealer: Oh... okay then.
 ![[Rog - Rog on The King _3 - L11 - A1.ogg]]


## Rog on Kingsmarch /3
Rog, the Dealer: Oh, Kingsmarch? It's what we Kalguurans call this little port town of ours, and also the region around it.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Kingsmarch _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: {Kings}march... you answer to some sort of King, then?
 ![[Rog - Rog on Kingsmarch _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Never seen a place like this. Must I speak to someone in charge?
 ![[Rog - Rog on Kingsmarch _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: And whose law must I follow in this place?
 ![[Rog - Rog on Kingsmarch _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: And what petty little man calls himself your lord?
 ![[Rog - Rog on Kingsmarch _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: {Kings}march? Ugh. So you've got a King to worry about, I take it?
 ![[Rog - Rog on Kingsmarch _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: {Kings}march... hmm. We have Counts and Thanes in Ezomyr.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Kingsmarch _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Cuttin' in on Trarthan trade, I see. Who's responsible?
 ![[Rog - Rog on Kingsmarch _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Rog, the Dealer: All this has been authorised by the King... and we certainly pay enough taxes that we can never forget that... but we're quite far from home. We're mostly left to our own devices. Oh, except for the King's Hand. He spends a season here each year to make sure we're on the up-and-up.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Kingsmarch _3 - L9 - A1.ogg]] ![[Rog - Rog on Kingsmarch _3 - L9 - A2.ogg]]


## Rog on Long Story /3
Rog, the Dealer: Alright then - if you insist, I'll tell the tale! Two decades ago, our glorious leader, Dannig, led us on an expedition across stormy and dangerous oceans to look for an artefact called the Triskelion Flame. Our search took us to the forsaken continent of Wraeclast, a land filled with horrible monsters and raving mad exiles!
 ![[Rog - Rog on Long Story _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Rog - Rog on Long Story _3 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

Ranger: So I've seen.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Long Story _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: So it seems.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Long Story _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: A sad state of affairs.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Long Story _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: And {me.}
 ![[Rog - Rog on Long Story _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Outside the Vastiri, maybe. You should visit our desert sometime. It is quite beautiful.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Long Story _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Ain't that the truth.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Long Story _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Rog, the Dealer: But we excavated many ancient sites, uncovering some of the lost history of our people's short residence here. Long ago, Kalguurans tried to settle on Wraeclast, and uh... well, yeah... it did not go well. In the end, they did not survive, and they lost the Triskelion Flame. We've been looking for it for over twenty years now, and, to be honest, we've gotten a bit sidetracked, but my wife refuses to give up on the dream.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Long Story _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]] ![[Rog - Rog on Long Story _3 - L8 - A2.ogg]]


## Rog on Humming Pearl /3
Rog, the Dealer: Oh my... what's that there? It's beautiful!
 ![[Rog - Rog on Humming Pearl _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: It's a pearl.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Humming Pearl _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: A pearl I found in a clam.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Humming Pearl _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: A treasure of the sea. A pearl.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Humming Pearl _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: A pearl, of course.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Humming Pearl _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I found it in some sort of shelled creature. I think you call it a... 'pearl'?
 ![[Rog - Rog on Humming Pearl _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: It's a pearl. I found it in a clam.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Humming Pearl _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: A big ol' pearl!
 ![[Rog - Rog on Humming Pearl _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Rog, the Dealer: That's not just any pearl... Hmm. I've an idea. I know I've got something around here that'd fit that nicely...
 ![[Rog - Rog on Humming Pearl _3 - L9 - A1.ogg]]


## Rog on Humming Pearl /2
Ranger: For me...? Huh... nobody's ever given me a gift like this before.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Humming Pearl _2 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Thank you kindly.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Humming Pearl _2 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: I accept this gift. Thank you.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Humming Pearl _2 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Hmm... a bit shiny. But I suppose I'll take it.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Humming Pearl _2 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Oh Sir Rog! Haha! I don't think you know what this means in the Vastiri, but I will take it as you intended.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Humming Pearl _2 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: Skilled work, my friend.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Humming Pearl _2 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: I'm always up to be bribed.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Humming Pearl _2 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Rog, the Dealer: Consider this kindness in the future, {friend.}
 ![[Rog - Rog on Humming Pearl _2 - L8 - A1.ogg]]


## Rog on The Preacher /1
Rog, the Dealer: Business has been on the rise ever since he took up residence outside my shop. People duck in here to seek refuge from him, and I make a sale while they hide. It's a win for everybody!
 ![[Rog - Rog on The Preacher _1 - L1 - A1.ogg]]


## Rog on Shop /3
Rog, the Dealer: This shop is my pride and joy. I've been dreaming of running my own place since my younger days, even though that was impossible back home.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Shop _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: What brought you here?
 ![[Rog - Rog on Shop _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: I'd never have left me home of my own choosin', no matter what I had to endure.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Shop _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: You followed a dream. I can respect that. What was your hardship?
 ![[Rog - Rog on Shop _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: What drove you away, fat one?
 ![[Rog - Rog on Shop _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: This sounds like a beautiful dream. Tell me more of this, Sir Rog.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Shop _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: Home is wherever your family is. What made you leave Kalguur?
 ![[Rog - Rog on Shop _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Ah, the quest for wealth. What was the issue in Kalguur?
 ![[Rog - Rog on Shop _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Rog, the Dealer: There are a limited number of merchant licenses, all owned by wealthy families. New licenses only come up every few years, but I could never afford one back in Kalguur. I've fallen on better times here in Wraeclast, you might say! So, here I am. I was never one for grand quests. Always preferred sorting logistics from the back... but I'm glad I'm here. I'd never have had my children, or built all this. The wife says I'm the real hero, because I have a business and support my family. She might just be buttering me up, but I still take it to heart.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Shop _3 - L9 - A1.ogg]] ![[Rog - Rog on Shop _3 - L9 - A2.ogg]] ![[Rog - Rog on Shop _3 - L9 - A3.ogg]]


## Rog on The Wife /2
Rog, the Dealer: Oh, my Gwennen never did feel quite comfortable here. She spends much of her time off continuing our adventure. Doesn't have anything to do with the King's Hand being in town this year...
 ![[Rog - Rog on The Wife _2 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: It's how I'd live, if I was here.
 ![[Rog - Rog on The Wife _2 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Ah. Say no more.
 ![[Rog - Rog on The Wife _2 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: I see.
 ![[Rog - Rog on The Wife _2 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Okay. Sure thing.
 ![[Rog - Rog on The Wife _2 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I understand you. I am not exactly welcome back home either. It is my bane to bear.
 ![[Rog - Rog on The Wife _2 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: I won't say a word.
 ![[Rog - Rog on The Wife _2 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: I catch what you're danglin'.
 ![[Rog - Rog on The Wife _2 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

## Rog on Order of the Chalice /5
Rog, the Dealer: I am bound by honour to discover the fate of Uhtred and the Order of the Chalice on Wraeclast. I'll trade you for any relics that you find with their marks and runes.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Order of the Chalice _5 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Who was in this Order?
 ![[Rog - Rog on Order of the Chalice _5 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: I'll bring you what I find. Who were they?
 ![[Rog - Rog on Order of the Chalice _5 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Tell me more of this 'Order of the Chalice.'
 ![[Rog - Rog on Order of the Chalice _5 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: I've never heard of this 'Order of the Chalice.'
 ![[Rog - Rog on Order of the Chalice _5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Order of the Chalice? They sound interesting. Tell me this tale.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Order of the Chalice _5 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: The Order of the Chalice? Who were they?
 ![[Rog - Rog on Order of the Chalice _5 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Will do. Out of curiosity, who were they?
 ![[Rog - Rog on Order of the Chalice _5 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Rog, the Dealer: They were the primary priesthood and religious order that went in with the initial ships to Wraeclast.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Order of the Chalice _5 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: A religious order? I thought the Kalguurans... hmm. What kind of priests?
 ![[Rog - Rog on Order of the Chalice _5 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: What is a 'priest?'
 ![[Rog - Rog on Order of the Chalice _5 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Ah, so heretics. Strange. I haven't heard you mention faith. Who were these priests?
 ![[Rog - Rog on Order of the Chalice _5 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: I thought you didn't have a religion. What kind of priests were they?
 ![[Rog - Rog on Order of the Chalice _5 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I did not know Kalguurans were religious types. What kind of priests were they?
 ![[Rog - Rog on Order of the Chalice _5 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: They were priests?
 ![[Rog - Rog on Order of the Chalice _5 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Ahh. So, a cult. Got it. What were they like?
 ![[Rog - Rog on Order of the Chalice _5 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Rog, the Dealer: Not quite the type you have out here. They interpreted the stars and the workings of mysterious forces, such as alchemy and runes. I've always wanted to join the Order. I quite like the idea of spending my days in a laboratory doing research.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Order of the Chalice _5 - L17 - A1.ogg]] ![[Rog - Rog on Order of the Chalice _5 - L17 - A2.ogg]]

## Rog on Introduction /3
Rog, the Dealer: We're back on the trail of the Triskelion Flame! Our grand quest has resumed once more. I'm a little fearful, but also excited. I have a good feeling about this.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Introduction _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: You know what? Me too.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Introduction _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: The hunt can be set aside, but it never ends.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Introduction _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: As do I.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Introduction _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: That makes one of us.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Introduction _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: It's good to see you out here, Sir Rog. I know you will achieve great things.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Introduction _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: That makes two of us.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Introduction _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Heheheh! You got a taste for it again?
 ![[Rog - Rog on Introduction _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Rog, the Dealer: The mind is willing... let's see how the body goes.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Introduction _3 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

## Rog on Olroth /3
Rog, the Dealer: You finally found and defeated Olroth! A battle for the ages, no doubt!
 ![[Rog - Rog on Olroth _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: That's not important. The Flame was destroyed.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Olroth _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: It would have been, if the Flame hadn't been destroyed.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Olroth _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: It's not about that. I couldn't save the Flame.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Olroth _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Of course. Shame about the Flame, though.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Olroth _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I wish you could have seen it, Sir Rog. Perhaps then you could have salvaged the Flame.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Olroth _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: It was. The Flame, unfortunately, was destroyed.
 ![[Rog - Rog on Olroth _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Right you are! Could't get the Flame, though...
 ![[Rog - Rog on Olroth _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Rog, the Dealer: {Olroth} had the Flame? Then Uhtred was not a traitor! I can finally set history right! I am descended from Owen, the son that Uhtred sent back for safety. You've washed clean a black mark on my lineage. I thank you. Still... a shame about the Flame being destroyed, of course.

## Rog on Uhtred /1
Rog, the Dealer: Thousands of years ago, the last news coming back home painted Uhtred in quite the negative light. Some called him a traitor, but the details were sparse and confusing. I'm here to clear his name... or condemn him. The truth shall stand above all.

## Rog on Uhtred /1
Rog, the Dealer: It sounds like Uhtred was indeed a traitor, but I feel like the story is not yet finished. Before I send word of this back home, would you find out the rest? It's... a matter of importance to me.
