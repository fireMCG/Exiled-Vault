## Rhodri on Best Recipes /6
Rhodri: My best recipes? Hmmm. That's a good question. Generally speaking, I cook what I've got. I can't cook what I haven't got now, can I?
 ![[Rhodri - Rhodri on Best Recipes _6 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Rhodri - Rhodri on Best Recipes _6 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

Warrior: Water and cabbage keeps a man alive. Mostly.
 ![[Rhodri - Rhodri on Best Recipes _6 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: So that's why it's hot cabbage water every night.
 ![[Rhodri - Rhodri on Best Recipes _6 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I suppose I prefer water and cabbage over fish. They're unnatural.
 ![[Rhodri - Rhodri on Best Recipes _6 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: I've never eaten this poorly in my life, and I grew up in the woods... So, what {do} you have?
 ![[Rhodri - Rhodri on Best Recipes _6 - L5 - A1.ogg]] ![[Rhodri - Rhodri on Best Recipes _6 - L5 - A2.ogg]]

Huntress: It's water and leaves again tonight, is it?
 ![[Rhodri - Rhodri on Best Recipes _6 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: That is technically true. And what {have} you to cook?
 ![[Rhodri - Rhodri on Best Recipes _6 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: What've you got, then? Don't say water and cabbage...
 ![[Rhodri - Rhodri on Best Recipes _6 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Rhodri: Trusty cabbage soup! A staple aboard the Aurora May. A tradition, really.
 ![[Rhodri - Rhodri on Best Recipes _6 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: Ugh. We should pick up better supplies.
 ![[Rhodri - Rhodri on Best Recipes _6 - L10 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: I've never been a fan of tradition. And now, even less.
 ![[Rhodri - Rhodri on Best Recipes _6 - L11 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Some traditions are mistakes.
 ![[Rhodri - Rhodri on Best Recipes _6 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: Yes... a tradition...
 ![[Rhodri - Rhodri on Best Recipes _6 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: I have no choice but to respect your ways... I 'spose.
 ![[Rhodri - Rhodri on Best Recipes _6 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Who am I to argue with tradition?
 ![[Rhodri - Rhodri on Best Recipes _6 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: He said it. Bugger me.
 ![[Rhodri - Rhodri on Best Recipes _6 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Rhodri: Well, look...
 ![[Rhodri - Rhodri on Best Recipes _6 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Rhodri: What's that supposed to mean then?
 ![[Rhodri - Rhodri on Best Recipes _6 - L18 - A1.ogg]]

Rhodri: Look, it ain't my fault!
 ![[Rhodri - Rhodri on Best Recipes _6 - L19 - A1.ogg]]

Rhodri: If you want fancy, go to the Kingsmarch tavern. We're here to do a job.

## Rhodri on Introduction /3
Rhodri: That bloody scoundrel, Kanu! I can't believe it! Rhodri's my name. Ship's cook, on this vessel at least.
 ![[Rhodri - Rhodri on Introduction _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Rhodri - Rhodri on Introduction _3 - L1 - A2.ogg]]

Warrior: Ah, so you make the food we've been... eating.
 ![[Rhodri - Rhodri on Introduction _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: I thought I was the one turning the crew green. Turns out, it was just your food.
 ![[Rhodri - Rhodri on Introduction _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: Your food is much maligned by the crew.
 ![[Rhodri - Rhodri on Introduction _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: You make the food we've been... eating? Ah. Right.
 ![[Rhodri - Rhodri on Introduction _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Is the food supposed to be like that, then?
 ![[Rhodri - Rhodri on Introduction _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Your meals have put me through quite the spiritual journey.
 ![[Rhodri - Rhodri on Introduction _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Your gruel is aptly named, mate. Grueling.
 ![[Rhodri - Rhodri on Introduction _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Rhodri: Don't hold it against me, I don't usually cook, okay? I just signed on to round out the crew. Technically, I'm the highest ranking Trade Guild member on this ship, so I guess... ... I'm the Captain now! I'll get you where you need to go in Makoru's absence. Our first order of business ought to be getting her back! Set a course, and I'll make it happen.
 ![[Rhodri - Rhodri on Introduction _3 - L9 - A1.ogg]] ![[Rhodri - Rhodri on Introduction _3 - L9 - A2.ogg]] ![[Rhodri - Rhodri on Introduction _3 - L9 - A3.ogg]] ![[Rhodri - Rhodri on Introduction _3 - L9 - A4.ogg]] ![[Rhodri - Rhodri on Introduction _3 - L9 - A5.ogg]] ![[Rhodri - Rhodri on Introduction _3 - L9 - A6.ogg]]


## Rhodri on Kanu /3
Rhodri: It'll haunt me forever. What was Kanu thinkin'? I knew he'd been out on Arastas a bunch... but I thought nothin' of it. Figured he was havin' a good time, the way a youngin should.
 ![[Rhodri - Rhodri on Kanu _3 - L1 - A1.ogg]] ![[Rhodri - Rhodri on Kanu _3 - L1 - A2.ogg]] ![[Rhodri - Rhodri on Kanu _3 - L1 - A3.ogg]]

Warrior: They have a worthy message. It is the messengers that are flawed.
 ![[Rhodri - Rhodri on Kanu _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: I've seen it. Religion and fear drive people to cruelty and madness.
 ![[Rhodri - Rhodri on Kanu _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: He is a {balbalakh}. His reasons are nothing but excuses.
 ![[Rhodri - Rhodri on Kanu _3 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: He gave his independence to others. Foolish.
 ![[Rhodri - Rhodri on Kanu _3 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: He's done more damage than he knows.
 ![[Rhodri - Rhodri on Kanu _3 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Belief is a powerful motivator.
 ![[Rhodri - Rhodri on Kanu _3 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: It's a cult. Seen enough of 'em to respect their game.
 ![[Rhodri - Rhodri on Kanu _3 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Rhodri: Bloody bastards. They've always been a bit spooky, but I didn't know it went this far. And then... there's Makoru. What a day it's been.

## Rhodri on Makoru /1
Rhodri: We've served on a few ships together now. I always tried to look out for her. Gave her a piece of advice now and then. We Kalguurans can be a bit hard-headed when it comes to foreigners. When she passed the Captain's Challenge with a unanimous vote, I was right proud. Her rescue should be our number one priority. We owe her that.

## Rhodri on Makoru /1
Rhodri: You saved Makoru? Good on ya! She's the heart of this crew. I can go back to cooking your meals now. Guess you played yourself, eh? Haha!

## Rhodri on Arastas /1
Rhodri: Not much to say about that lot. Other than... They're a bunch of nutters. And to think what they've been up to all this time...


## Rhodri on Eye of Hinekora /1
Rhodri: You met the Karui Mother of Death? I don't think I wanna hear any more about that. Consider me right spooked.


## Rhodri on Eye of Hinekora /1
Rhodri: I've heard tell of this place. To see it with me own eyes... Blimey. I'd count myself a lucky man. More than happy to take ya there!


## Rhodri on Isle of Kin /1
Rhodri: I stay well away from that lot. The kinfolk. They're bloody well rabid for whatever's in that mountain. ... guess you wanna take a look, right?


## Rhodri on Isle of Kin /1
Rhodri: So it wasn't all blunder, eh? There was a giant in the mountain! And you took it down! Well, I'll be damned...


## Rhodri on Kedge Bay /1
Rhodri: That fog is the cause of a lot of problems. Let me tell you, every time I get near it... I start seeing things. I'd really rather not go there!


## Rhodri on Kedge Bay /1
Rhodri: Well... the fog is gone. But... you let out some fearsome thing. Win some, lose some... I guess. I wonder what might be left over from all the crashed ships there... hmm...


## Rhodri on Ngakanu /1
Rhodri: Tavakai fled there with Makoru. I still can't believe all that's happened. I knew he was a difficult fella, but this... He's lost his Way.


## Rhodri on Plunder's Point /1
Rhodri: Ahh... what've we got here then? I got no idea about this location. Guess we could take a look? But you're splittin' whatever you find with me, alright?


## Rhodri on Plunder's Point /1
Rhodri: Nothin' much to see there no more. Got the treasure. Got out. Can go back if you like... I guess.


## Rhodri on Abandoned Prison /1
Rhodri: Oh come on now... we needn't go there. Can smell death as soon as you near the shore! And the moanin' and yellin'... look. It's no good. Let's go somewhere else!


## Rhodri on Abandoned Prison /1
Rhodri: So you ran through that damned place and killed something... unkillable? You're gonna give me bloody nightmares at this rate!


## Rhodri on Shrike Island /1
Rhodri: As much as I respect Karui culture, that place... it's not for me. The shrikes that nest there are right bloody fearsome. I can take a seagull or two, but them... they'll take your bloody head off!


## Rhodri on Whakapanu Island /1
Rhodri: Hard one to wrap your lips around innit? At first it feels like yer cursin'! But... it has quite a beautiful meaning in the Karui tongue.


## Rhodri on Whakapanu Island /1
Rhodri: There was a siren in the caves of Whakapanu Island? Well I'll be... you sure pack a wallop, don't ya? It's a lovely place. I look forward to stopping by sometime.


## Rhodri on Whakapanu Island /1
Rhodri: So, you've got a piece of land for yourself and Ange, eh? Good on ya. I've got half a mind to set up shop myself one of these days. Rhodri's Soup Shop! Haha! Just kiddin'. You know I can't bloody cook.
