## Renly on Recruiting the Ezomytes /1
Renly: I knew you'd handle it! You've never let us down. I thank you. Now... as promised, we are prepared to follow you into the great battle you spoke of. I've spoken on your behalf. The Thanes will answer the call. The clans will all join this war. If this is the end, you bloody well know the Ezomytes will go down fighting.

I've spoken on your behalf. The Thanes will answer the call. The clans will all join this war. If this is the end, you bloody well know the Ezomytes will go down fighting.

## Renly on Recruiting the Ezomytes /5
Renly: What brings you here? Your timing is impeccable. We could sorely use your aid.
 ![[Renly - Renly on Recruiting the Ezomytes _5 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Renly: It's good you're here. Our will to survive is being tested, yet again.
 ![[Renly - Renly on Recruiting the Ezomytes _5 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Warrior: Father... we need the strength of the Ezomytes. Wraeclast is in peril.
 ![[Renly - Renly on Recruiting the Ezomytes _5 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: I came here to recruit you, not the other way around.
 ![[Renly - Renly on Recruiting the Ezomytes _5 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: That is unfortunate. We have great need of you, and your fellow Ezomytes.
 ![[Renly - Renly on Recruiting the Ezomytes _5 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: It's good to be home, but I, too, have grave news. Wraeclast may fall to Corruption, and we need you to fight.
 ![[Renly - Renly on Recruiting the Ezomytes _5 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Aye, Renly. Seems our survival will be tested to the end of our days. The Ezomytes are needed for a coming battle.
 ![[Renly - Renly on Recruiting the Ezomytes _5 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Unfortunately, we need the Ezomytes to stave off a coming doom.
 ![[Renly - Renly on Recruiting the Ezomytes _5 - L8 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Wish I had better news for ya mate, but we need ya. You and all your Ezomytes. War is coming.
 ![[Renly - Renly on Recruiting the Ezomytes _5 - L9 - A1.ogg]]

Renly: By the First Ones... you're calling us to war? Our people do owe you a debt... but right now, Ogham is on the brink of destruction once more. We can't sleep. We can't move. We can't rebuild... We're being picked off in the dead of night! One by one, our people are being dragged off into the darkness. Only the distant sound of screams gives us a clue as to what has happened.

Renly: By the First Ones... you're calling us to war? My boy... you know my people are your people, and we stand with you. But, right now, Ogham is on the brink of destruction once more. We can't sleep. We can't move. We can't rebuild... We're being picked off in the dead of night! One by one, our people are being dragged off into the darkness. Only the distant sound of screams gives us a clue as to what has happened.

Warrior: What's doing this, Father?
 ![[Renly - Renly on Recruiting the Ezomytes _5 - L12 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: And I suppose you want me to deal with this, too.
 ![[Renly - Renly on Recruiting the Ezomytes _5 - L13 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: This sounds serious.
 ![[Renly - Renly on Recruiting the Ezomytes _5 - L14 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: It never ends.
 ![[Renly - Renly on Recruiting the Ezomytes _5 - L15 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: That's no bloody good.
 ![[Renly - Renly on Recruiting the Ezomytes _5 - L16 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Do you have any idea {why} this is happening?
 ![[Renly - Renly on Recruiting the Ezomytes _5 - L17 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: Kidnapping, but no ransom?
 ![[Renly - Renly on Recruiting the Ezomytes _5 - L18 - A1.ogg]]

Renly: Our neighbours... in Holten. Thane Wulfric and Lady Elswyth have lost their bloody minds. Bloodletting. Torture. Pain, misery, and death! That's all that lies in wait for those stolen off to Holten. Look, now I understand you need us, but we can't leave this place undefended in the face of this. Help us once more, and we'll come to your aid.

## Renly on Recruiting the Ezomytes /2
Warrior: I will put this Thane in his place.
 ![[Renly - Renly on Recruiting the Ezomytes _2 - L1 - A1.ogg]]

Witch: Fine. I'll do your dirty work.
 ![[Renly - Renly on Recruiting the Ezomytes _2 - L2 - A1.ogg]]

Sorceress: I will do this thing you ask of me.
 ![[Renly - Renly on Recruiting the Ezomytes _2 - L3 - A1.ogg]]

Ranger: I will do what I must to defend my home.
 ![[Renly - Renly on Recruiting the Ezomytes _2 - L4 - A1.ogg]]

Huntress: Alright then. I'll hunt them down.
 ![[Renly - Renly on Recruiting the Ezomytes _2 - L5 - A1.ogg]]

Monk: Consider it done.
 ![[Renly - Renly on Recruiting the Ezomytes _2 - L6 - A1.ogg]]

Mercenary: I'm on it. Gladly.
 ![[Renly - Renly on Recruiting the Ezomytes _2 - L7 - A1.ogg]]

Renly: Good. We've still not rebuilt the roads the Count destroyed, so you'll have to take a harrowing route. Of late, we call it the Blackwood, for it has become home to darkness and madness. You'll find a path to reach it through the crops. Una knows more about the Blackwood's curse... I dare not go there. Should you need to, call on her.

## Renly on Kingsmarch /1
Renly: So this is Kingsmarch. Quite the marvel. And Dannig's forge... Oh, what I wouldn't give for some of that gear! We're ready and waiting. Right behind you.

## Renly on Bloodletting /1
Renly: Travellers report terrible things happening in Holten. Those who refuse to join the cult are... ritually cut. Warnings written in blood on doors and... and on the stone of the roads. That was the last we heard. I've no doubt it's gotten worse. Creeping darkness has spread even further, it seems. The Ogham of old would have stamped out this madness with strength of arm and heart...

## Renly on Holten /3
Renly: The Thanedom of Holten is closest to us by land. Their Thanes have long been our Count's right-hand men. We don't even consider ourselves separate. We intermarry all the time, and share in the harvest. It was bad enough when Thane Wulfric refused to help us, due to the Count's madness. Stealing people away when we're vulnerable... it is unthinkable...

Renly: You know it well. The Thanedom of Holten is closest to us by land, and their Thanes have long been our Count's right-hand men. It was bad enough when Thane Wulfric refused to help us, due to the Count's madness. Stealing people away when we're vulnerable... it's unthinkable...
 ![[Renly - Renly on Holten _3 - L2 - A1.ogg]] ![[Renly - Renly on Holten _3 - L2 - A2.ogg]] ![[Renly - Renly on Holten _3 - L2 - A3.ogg]]

Warrior: I won't let this stand.
 ![[Renly - Renly on Holten _3 - L3 - A1.ogg]]


## Renly on Rebuilding /1
Renly: Ogham's the maiden at the end of the bridge, so to speak. Right now, we're working on food and clean water. There were a fair number of survivors hiding in the woods. A stroke of fortune, but that comes with needs. For now, we're just happy to survive each day... and each night.

## Renly on Thane and Lady /1
Renly: Well, we thought that Thane Wulfric and Lady Elswyth might have been driven mad by Corruption... ... but Holten, and the Blackwood, oh... are suffering from a far different malady. Cultists walk their streets, darkness clouds their land, and whispers hound any who travel there. Finn told us how it reminds him of Freythorn. The bloodletting... the rituals... oh... it's horrible to think an entire Thanedom has fallen.

## Renly on The Warden /1
Renly: Many of those stolen away were by the hand of that Warden. The torturous fiend. You've done us a service.
