## Guiding Palm (Fire)
"When the Third Pact was written in stone, the Dreamer gave the alliance of men and  
beasts knowledge. In return, they gave him a drop of blood; one from each of the  
races of Wraeclast. In the centuries that followed, his Will began to subtly change."  
- Book of the Benevolent Dreamer, Histories 220:5
