## Letters from Chitus Perandus 1

Uncle Cadiro 3rd Kaso of Vitali, 1316 I.C. 

While my father remains determined to play the role of Izaro's lapdog. I trust that you and I are of like mind regarding our glorious Emperor's ridiculous Labyrinth. He would have us entrust our imperial leadership to the primitive diversions of some cave-dwelling ancestors. It is beyond reasoning. In fact, it can only be surmised that Izaro himself is also beyond reasoning.

On that matter, I suppose it should come as no surprise. Phrecius blood has become polluted by decadence and incest. It is no secret. So perhaps it is a matter of good fortune that Izaro has not been able to sire an heir, for such a whelp would be undoubtedly dim or demented. Yes, such emperors are easy to control, but they can also be extremely dangerous, as the Empire learned all too well with Romira.

So in his own deluded way, Izaro is right to look to fresh sources of blood to serve our Eternal Empire. Yet he looks in the wrong places. Perandus blood has served the throne proudly since Veruso first set his foot upon the soil of Sarn. Perandus gold has filled the imperial coffers. Perandus minds have crafted this Empire into the marvel it is today.

And has a single Perandus ever sat upon the imperial throne? No.

Izaro's plans are an insult to the Empire and an insult to us, its most devoted servants. Izaro spits upon our very blood and then offers up everything we have worked for to the first fortunate fool who stumbles through his little maze.

I will not stand by and allow Izaro to deliver us all unto damnation. I trust, dear uncle, that I can rely on your support.

\- Chitus Perandus
