## Letters from Chitus Perandus 2

Uncle Cadiro 1st Lunaro of Verusi 1317, I.C.

Our Eternal Empire Izaro might be insane but he's clearly not stupid. Or at the very least, he has had the presence of mind to surround himself with clever people. Three meticulously planned attempts on Izaro's life. Three astutely thwarted failures.

Of course, none of them can be traced back to us, Uncle. You can rest assured that I have been most discrete in my arrangements. As for Cousin Elano, he will be dead by sunrise. We need not fair any inconvenient disclosure on his part, and his is not a Perandus by name. His familial connection is known only to us. It's a simple matter to keep a bastard or two in the shadows for occasions such as this. Legitimacy is a useful carrot to dangle.

I assume you've been keeping abreast of the labyrinth's progress? I have purchased several of Izaro's overseers and they keep my informed. I'm told it's to house quite the menagerie of monstrosities. And the mechanisms that are currently being installed, many of which. Izaro has designed himself, are utterly nefarious in their invention. While one might easily question the man's rationality, one cannot so easily discount his imagination. If only Izaro had contented himself with an artistic pursuit some kind, such as painting or sculpture. Instead he now drains the imperial coffers dry, building a delirious promise to the peasants and peons of Wraeclast.

"Come one and all. Enjoy the largest playground ever created. And should you win the games that I have laid out for you, why, you shall be crowned emperor!"

Izaro would place our fortunes in the calloused hands of ignorance. He would have us forget the centuries of leadership, diplomacy prosperity and security that we, the ruling families of Sarn, have amassed.

Izaro's folly will be the end of beloved empire.

I, for one, will not let that happen, Uncle.
