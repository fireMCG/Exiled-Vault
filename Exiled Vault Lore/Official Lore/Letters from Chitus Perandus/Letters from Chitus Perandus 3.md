## ## Letters from Chitus Perandus 3

Uncle Cadiro 3rd Solaro of Divini, 1318 I.C.

I am as ready for this Labyrinth as I will ever be. Each day I have trained with the duelist, Kre Faarblood. There is no better swordsman in all of Sarn and I have been a most attentive pupil. So attentive that he made the mistake of admitting, after his twelfth cup of wine, that he is not of the noble blood he claims to be. His 'disinherited dandy' act is just that an act. People have a tendency to entrust me with their secrets. I know it's a valuable gift.

Please have Faarblood tried and hanged, discretely, away from the crowds. We simply can't have commoners impersonating their betters.

Yes, I have familiarized myself with the architectural plans you so kindly obtained for me, and I have paid certain overseers handsomely for further details regarding Izaro's various hazards and living horrors. The man is obsessed with spikes. They pop out of the floor, spin on treacherously shifting wheels and even roam about like predators in search of prey. Izaro's mechanisms are truly of the most devious design. And the creatures! If it bites, claws or stings, it now lives in that Labyrinth.

Fear not, uncle. I have designs of my own. My hirelings shall place discrete caches of supplies here and there, in the eventuality that I should need restoration or assistance. I shall enclose a list of their names. It would be our interests if those named men and women were to, upon the Labyrinth's completion, suffer accidents of a mortal nature. One word spoken carelessly could end any hope of the Perandus ever ascending the imperial throne. A few common lives are nothing compared to the slaughter that would occur if, God help us, one of the Ezomyte contenders survived this Labyrinth in my stead.

So there it is. Our noble endeavour to save our Empire from a madman. I do this for our family. I do this for our Empire.

We are Eternal.

\- Chitus Perandus
