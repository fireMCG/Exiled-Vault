## Mercenaries
#### NonEleBowRanger1
"Even a lawless land needs rules. Even anarchy requires order." - Kylian Cyaxan

#### NonEleBowRanger2
As Cyaxan's criminal empire grew, so too did its need for enforcers. The Trarthan militia was its answer.

#### NonEleBowRanger3
Order came later. At first, the Trarthan militia was little more than muscle - sold to the highest house, and drunk on its coin.

#### NonEleBowRanger4
The Trarthan militia delivers justice swiftly - usually before a crime is even committed.

#### NonEleBowRanger5
"The militia don't keep the peace. They keep Trarthus profitable."

#### NonEleBowRanger6
"They weren't just enforcers. They were reminders - of who ruled Korathin's gutters, and what disobedience cost."

#### NonEleBowRanger7
For a time, the militia had the slums on lockdown. Then Cyaxan flooded them with gems - and the streets ran red with blood.

#### NonEleBowRanger8
Of all Kylian Cyaxan's sins, virtue gems were the most costly. Blinded by greed, he never foresaw the chaos they'd unleash.

#### NonEleBowRanger9
Kylian Cyaxan demanded a swift response to the chaos in the streets. The militia answered - virtue gems in hand.

#### NonEleBowRanger10
The militia met fire with fire - gems for gems, blood for blood.

#### NonEleBowRanger11
With gems came power - and with power came fewer survivors of the militia's 'justice'.

#### NonEleBowRanger12
"They called it peace when the killing slowed. Not justice - just fewer people left to fight back... and even fewer who would dare."

#### NonEleBowRangerNoble1
{0} Cyaxan once kept order in Korathin's worst quarter. Now she keeps trophies instead.

#### NonEleBowRangerNoble2
{0} was born of Cyaxan stock, raised on slum smoke and discipline.

#### NonEleBowRangerNoble3
{0} Cyaxan: a name once feared across the Trarthan militia ranks - feared even more now she's off the leash.

#### NonEleBowRangerNoble4
Trarthus was barren after the Vaal Cataclysm... until the Empire began exiling their unwanted to its bleak shores.

#### NonEleBowRangerNoble5
"Our ancestors were exiled so that the Eternal Empire could have its thousand-year peace. I don't give a damn about Wraeclast."

#### EleBowRanger1
Gems from Trarthus have their own trademarks. Like the populace, they are more brutal.

#### EleBowRanger2
Keitan slaves built the walls of Korathin. Kylian Cyaxan filled them with vice before the mortar had dried.

#### EleBowRanger3
Cyaxan brothels bore no name. But those who entered often forget their own.

#### EleBowRanger4
First came desire. Then came dependency. Cyaxan offered both - by design.

#### EleBowRanger5
The courtesans were Cyaxan's first pushers. Pleasure and powder ensured each customer returned - shaking a little more each time.

#### EleBowRanger6
Most were addicted before they even knew it - such was the potency of Cyaxan's blend.

#### EleBowRanger7
"In the early days, the drug trade was shared. Then Cyaxan made sharing... unprofitable."

#### EleBowRanger8
When even dependency began to dull, Kylian Cyaxan sought something stronger - 'virtue' in crystalline form.

#### EleBowRanger9
While most wielded gems for violence, Kylian Cyaxan saw in them something far more sordid.

#### EleBowRanger10
The first gem-lit flesh in Trarthus didn't belong to a warrior. It belonged to a courtesan.

#### EleBowRanger12
Some gems enhanced sensation. Others suppressed it - turning bodies into tools of compliance.

#### EleBowRanger13
What began as pleasure became ritual. What began as choice became conditioning.

#### EleBowRanger14
"Kylian Cyaxan is long dead - as are many of his customers. But the thing about that kind of customer? They replenish themselves."

#### EleBowRanger16
"Brick and stone may hold a city... but pleasure holds a people." - Kylian Cyaxan

#### EleBowRangerNoble1
{0} Cyaxan knew every back alley in Korathin - especially the ones that glittered.

#### EleBowRangerNoble2
The gems are socketed deep. {0} Cyaxan's need, deeper still.

#### EleBowRangerNoble3
If it glints, {0} Cyaxan follows. If it runs, she chases.

#### EleBowRangerNoble4
"As decaying Empires are wont to do, the use of exile as a punishment gradually became more common over the centuries..."

#### EleBowRangerNoble5
The Eternal Empire eventually made their greatest mistake: they exiled a simple farmer to Trarthus.

#### MeleeAOEMarauder1
In Korathin's slave pits, Keita found its fortune. Death made for eager audiences.

#### MeleeAOEMarauder2
Keitan slaves raised the walls of Korathin. Their blood still clings to the mortar.

#### MeleeAOEMarauder3
House Keita did not always command such fear. It was their crushing of the rebellion that made them a force to be reckoned with.

#### MeleeAOEMarauder4
The slave rebellion began with a whisper. A promise of freedom passed from throat to throat, louder each time.

#### MeleeAOEMarauder5
One night, the chains fell silent. The next, they snapped. Keitans awoke to fire in their camps and blood on their floors.

#### MeleeAOEMarauder6
It took just three days. Three days for Keita to crush the dissidents, reforge the chains, and fill the pits with corpses.

#### MeleeAOEMarauder7
Keita left the rebels hanging, stripped and nameless. Not as martyrs - just meat, gone to waste.

#### MeleeAOEMarauder8
After the revolt, Ixan Keita declared the slaves must be reminded of their place. Thus began the Trarthan slave pits.

#### MeleeAOEMarauder9
From the ashes of rebellion came the slave pit - dug to remind the living what happened to those who sought freedom.

#### MeleeAOEMarauder10
The slave pits are a reflection of Trarthan society: brutal, bloodthirsty, and swift to punish mistakes.

#### MeleeAOEMarauder11
Keita doesn't fear uprisings anymore. Every lash, every cage, every pit - lessons carved in flesh.

#### MeleeAOEMarauder13
"In Trarthus, freedom is earned, not given."

#### MeleeAOEMarauderNoble1
"The lucky ones die early. The rest learn to live with it."

#### MeleeAOEMarauderNoble2
Fighting in chains taught {0} everything he needed - including how to break them.

#### MeleeAOEMarauderNoble3
Inside Trarthus or out, slave or slaver - none bred more enemies than House Keita.

#### MeleeAOEMarauderNoble4
The Trarthans paid back their debt to the Karui, aiding them when it was their turn to battle the Empire.

#### MeleeAOEMarauderNoble5
When Tyndarus Phrecius tried to resupply his occupying legions on Trarthus, the Karui blockaded the Archipelago.

#### MeleeStrikesMarauder1
Trarthan slavers are despicable - and indispensable.

#### MeleeStrikesMarauder2
Of all the Trarthan Death Trades, none strip the soul quite like slavery - brutal in both intent and execution.

#### MeleeStrikesMarauder15
Trarthus was built on the backs of slaves, whose labour shaped much of its infrastructure. At the whip-hand stood House Keita.

#### MeleeStrikesMarauder4
Cruel even by Trarthan standards, House Keita's blend of brutality and efficiency made them ideal architects of the slave trade.

#### MeleeStrikesMarauder5
In their prime, Keita built more than cities - they built leverage. For a time, no House dared challenge their hold on Trarthus.

#### MeleeStrikesMarauder6
Ixan Keita helped build Trarthus - and nearly ruled it. But power begets ambition, and ambition always demands more.

#### MeleeStrikesMarauder7
The ambition of Ixan Keita was his undoing. His bid for power sparked war with Bardiya - a war Keita could not win.

#### MeleeStrikesMarauder8
Keita held the chains. Bardiya cut the purse strings. Trarthus watched as labour lost to leverage - and coin won the war.

#### MeleeStrikesMarauder9
Keita swore fealty to the Council with a clenched jaw. Better a seat at the table than exile from the game entirely.

#### MeleeStrikesMarauder10
Though the Keita of today is still a House of influence, Bardiya remembers their treachery - and limits their power accordingly.

#### MeleeStrikesMarauder12
"House Keita wrote the bloody book on cruelty. Think of the worst bastard you know - either they're a Keitan, or a poor imitation."

#### MeleeStrikesMarauder13
"The Merchant Council's a leash on House Keita - and the irony ain't lost on 'em. Still, better leashed than buried."

#### MeleeStrikesMarauder14
"Pain is the language of obedience." - Ixan Keita

#### MeleeStrikesMarauderNoble1
{0} Keita built his name in the slave pits of Korathin - and built his fortune on the backs beneath him.

#### MeleeStrikesMarauderNoble2
Slaves obeyed. Rivals bled. The rest learned to stay out of {0} Keita's way.

#### MeleeStrikesMarauderNoble3
The pits made killers of men... and monsters of those who ran them.

#### MeleeStrikesMarauderNoble4
For centuries, ash from Karui volcanoes rode the wind to Trarthus. It turned slaves into the continent's finest tools.

#### MeleeStrikesMarauderNoble5
"Slavery began on Trarthus when a simple farmer offered to serve and grow food in exchange for his life. Pathetic... but profitable."

#### ElementalWitch1
Thaumaturgy in Trarthus is like smoke in the lungs - unpleasant, expected, and always present.

#### ElementalWitch2
Before vice, before gems, before brothels and powder - Cyaxan dealt in spices, cloth and coin.

#### ElementalWitch3
"They all started legitimate - even Cyaxan. But virtue doesn't buy power. Vice does."

#### ElementalWitch4
Cyaxan didn't need blades. They had margins - and the power that comes from knowing what everyone else wanted.

#### ElementalWitch5
In time, margins thinned. Rivals grew bolder. So Cyaxan found new markets - darker ones.

#### ElementalWitch6
Cyaxan didn't set out to rule the underworld. Only to survive it. Then survival turned to opportunity.

#### ElementalWitch7
Kylian Cyaxan's ascent to lord of the Trarthan underworld was not without obstacles. The first arose within his own house.

#### ElementalWitch8
Kylian's first victim wasn't a member of a rival House - it was family. From then on, betrayal became tradition.

#### ElementalWitch9
Kylian Cyaxan never raised his voice. Just his glass. The rest of the table never stood again.

#### ElementalWitch10
With rivals dead or disgraced, Kylian moved fast - consolidating power, ensuring no Cyaxan could rise as he had.

#### ElementalWitch11
Kylian never trusted alliances. He preferred leverage. Internally, that meant secrets. Externally, sabotage.

#### ElementalWitch13
"When dining with a Cyaxan, bring an appetite - and an antidote."

#### ElementalWitch14
Cyaxan rarely availed themselves of House Azadi's services. They preferred less... bloody methods.

#### ElementalWitchNoble1
It wasn't people {0} Cyaxan loathed, but the frailties they wore so proudly: need, artifice, expectation.

#### ElementalWitchNoble2
Cold, restrained, detached - anathema to Cyaxan ideals. But death has many forms, and {0} excelled in hers.

#### ElementalWitchNoble3
{0} Cyaxan despised mess - of thought, of feeling, of flesh.

#### ElementalWitchNoble4
"Emperor Tyndarus Phrecius was a fool who let a wasteland full of exiles defy the Empire."

#### ElementalWitchNoble5
"Trarthus lives on, long after the dying husk of its parent Empire has become nothing but a memory."

#### ChaosMinionWitch1
In the early days of Trarthus, each House kept to its corner. Peace held - not through trust, but through distance.

#### ChaosMinionWitch2
As each House drifted from legitimacy to vice, conflict was inevitable. Kylian Cyaxan made sure of it.

#### ChaosMinionWitch3
"They say Kylian Cyaxan was once an upstanding merchant. But then, they say a lot of things."

#### ChaosMinionWitch4
"To play both sides well is to leave no fingerprints - only consequences." - Kylian Cyaxan

#### ChaosMinionWitch5
History blames Bardiya and Keita for the Merchant Wars. Fewer recall that Cyaxan was whispering in both ears all along.

#### ChaosMinionWitch6
As Bardiya and Keita went to war, Kylian Cyaxan stayed neutral - by selling secrets to both sides.

#### ChaosMinionWitch7
"A Cyaxan will stir the pot, watch it boil, then let others burn their hands - all while they slip out the back door."

#### ChaosMinionWitch8
"There's coin in war... so long as you're not the one fighting it." - Kylian Cyaxan

#### ChaosMinionWitch9
The Merchant Wars began with tariffs and treaties. They ended with fire, famine, and grudges that would last a lifetime.

#### ChaosMinionWitch10
When all was said and done, the Merchant Wars had made fortunes for the few - and graves for the many.

#### ChaosMinionWitch11
Cyaxan may have lit the fire. But when bodies piled high and profits ran dry, even Kylian sought peace.

#### ChaosMinionWitch12
The end of the Merchant Wars came not from diplomacy, but depletion. The Houses didn't shake hands - they paused to reload.

#### ChaosMinionWitch13
No House admits to starting the Merchant Wars. But every House claims to have won them.

#### ChaosMinionWitchNoble1
Some Cyaxans peddled pleasure, others poison. {0} Cyaxan peddled death.

#### ChaosMinionWitchNoble2
Even {0}'s fellow Cyaxans questioned her methods. But never their efficacy.

#### ChaosMinionWitchNoble3
Few in Trarthus kill with curses or corpses. But those who do face no fear of retribution.

#### ChaosMinionWitchNoble4
"They exiled their undesirables to Trarthus, and then had the gall to act surprised when those undesirables refused to bow down."

#### ChaosMinionWitchNoble5
"Witches aren't feared in Trarthus. They're adored. We wisely sided with the rebels against Little Tinny Phrecius."

#### PhysConvertTemplar1
In Trarthus, faith never died. It just turned inward.

#### PhysConvertTemplar2
The major Houses didn't worship gods. They tried to become them.

#### PhysConvertTemplar3
Divinity demands belief. Trarthus demanded proof.

#### PhysConvertTemplar4
One claimed the mantle of flame. Another of blood. But in a city of rival 'gods', none rose above the noise.

#### PhysConvertTemplar5
A House could rise through war, through gold, through secrets - but not through grace.

#### PhysConvertTemplar6
Ixan Keita declared himself a god - and built temples to prove it. His slaves were given no choice but to pray.

#### PhysConvertTemplar7
In his quest for Divinity, Ixan Keita demanded worship. Obedience was beaten in. But no man ever reached godhood through fear alone.

#### PhysConvertTemplar8
They sang of Ixan Keita, knelt in his hollow shrines... but their hearts spoke only of hate.

#### PhysConvertTemplar9
Ixan mistook silence for reverence. In truth, not one soul believed. And so he remained just that: a mortal soul.

#### PhysConvertTemplar10
"Let them hate me, if they must. Even hatred bows to power." - Ixan Keita

#### PhysConvertTemplar11
They preached in alleyways and taverns. Few listened. Fewer remembered.

#### PhysConvertTemplar12
Attempts to bring organised religion to Trarthus were many - and all of them met with blood.

#### PhysConvertTemplar13
Faith is tolerated in Trarthus - but only so long as it is kept to one's self.

#### PhysConvertTemplar14
Even the pious stray in Trarthus - led not by devils, but by gold and supple skin.

#### PhysConvertTemplar15
Trarthans revere but one god: the almighty coin.

#### PhysConvertTemplar16
"If your mission should take you to Trarthus, you'd best carry a knife." - Gospel and Blade

#### PhysConvertTemplarNoble1
{0} Keita came to preach salvation. He left certain there was none to be found.

#### PhysConvertTemplarNoble2
In a city built on secrets, faith never stood a chance.

#### PhysConvertTemplarNoble3
Though born of Keita blood, {0} sought to better Trarthus through faith - until his kin reminded him where power truly lay.

#### PhysConvertTemplarNoble4
Once Emperor Tyndarus caught wind of Trarthan warlords setting up a society, he sent his legions to stomp them back down.

#### PhysConvertTemplarNoble5
The Phrecian legions executed the warlords of that era, and instituted crushing taxes on the budding Trarthan society.

#### AurasMinionsTemplar1
Some foreigners cling to warm memories of Divinity. In Trarthus, that's considered true madness.

#### AurasMinionsTemplar2
Trarthans know Innocence not as a god, but as a tale told by passing missionaries - and quickly forgotten.

#### AurasMinionsTemplar3
"A fire that does not warm, does not feed, does not kill... what use is it in Trarthus?"

#### AurasMinionsTemplar4
Innocence preaches purity. Trarthus breeds survival. The two have little in common.

#### AurasMinionsTemplar5
"When they call Korathin a city of sin, they're not talking about the god."

#### AurasMinionsTemplar6
"Some say there's no honour left in Korathin. Others say it never belonged here to begin with."

#### AurasMinionsTemplar7
A good deed in Trarthus gets you one thing: a target on your back.

#### AurasMinionsTemplar8
"What's a man to do with morals, when no one else plays by them?"

#### AurasMinionsTemplar10
Even in Trarthus, someone buries the bodies. Someone remembers the names.

#### AurasMinionsTemplar11
Some virtues endure - not in law, nor gods, but in spite of both.

#### AurasMinionsTemplar12
The surest way to frighten Ixan Keita was kindness. Always hunting for an angle, he could never see it for what it was.

#### AurasMinionsTemplar13
Keita drew brutes from every corner - sadists, zealots, and worse. What bound them was a taste for cruelty.

#### AurasMinionsTemplarNoble1
They mocked {0} Keita's prayers. Until one day, the sinner burned, and they said nothing more.

#### AurasMinionsTemplarNoble2
Trarthus could not unmake {0} Keita's faith. But it tried. With ridicule. With pain. With temptation.

#### AurasMinionsTemplarNoble3
Innocence found no altar in Trarthus. Just one man.

#### AurasMinionsTemplarNoble4
In 870 IC, the four great Founders spurred their guerrilla rebellion into open warfare against the occupying legions.

#### AurasMinionsTemplarNoble5
It took two years of open warfare, but Tyndarus finally capitulated in exchange for the lives of his legions.

#### PhysicalDuelist1
Trarthus was lawless once - but not without rules. Some approached the Death Trades with grace... and surprising decorum.

#### PhysicalDuelist2
Before the Merchant Wars. Before the Council. Before Trarthus had a name. There was the Code.

#### PhysicalDuelist4
The Trarthan Code was not written - not at first. It was remembered. Passed in whispers, etched in scars.

#### PhysicalDuelist5
"Break the Code, and you risked more than your life. You risked your name."

#### PhysicalDuelist6
Whether in gutters or along trade routes, the Code took root where laws could not.

#### PhysicalDuelist7
House Bardiya were first to back the Code - an early sign of their predilection for order and control.

#### PhysicalDuelist8
To House Azadi, the Code wasn't a set of rules. It was a contract. And they never broke contracts.

#### PhysicalDuelist9
Cyaxan did not endorse the Code. Not at first. They waited, watched, and once it took hold, claimed they'd backed it all along.

#### PhysicalDuelist10
Even House Keita, for all their brutality, bowed to the Code. Not out of respect - but survival.

#### PhysicalDuelist11
Even under Council rule, the Code endures - now etched into law.

#### PhysicalDuelist12
"Travel to Trarthus is discouraged. Should you go, learn the Code - and honour it." - A Merchant's Guide to Trarthus

#### PhysicalDuelist13
"Break the Trarthan Code and you'll likely be buried by someone who didn't." - A Merchant's Guide to Trarthus

#### PhysicalDuelist14
"Those under the Great Houses shall answer any blood wager issued." - Trarthan Code, Article V

#### PhysicalDuelistNoble1
{0} Azadi's words? Withering. His blade? Equally so.

#### PhysicalDuelistNoble2
"Elegance is not lost in violence - only in vulgarity." - {0} Azadi

#### PhysicalDuelistNoble3
"Ask any Azadin... You don't get rich in Trarthus by being bad in a fight." - {0} Azadi

#### PhysicalDuelistNoble4
"The four Great Founders were not exiles. 'Twas the first Trarthan-born generation, once we actually had a modicum of society going."

#### PhysicalDuelistNoble5
The four Great Houses were once begrudging allies, fighting a guerilla war against occupying legions.

#### MeleeAOEStrikeDuelist1
Violence has always been common in Trarthus. But it was Ratha Azadi who commodified it - turned it into an art form all her own.

#### MeleeAOEStrikeDuelist2
Azadi distinguished itself not through efficiency, but through audacious spectacle. Azadins didn't kill. They wove death itself.

#### MeleeAOEStrikeDuelist3
Ratha Azadi understood that killing goes beyond the act itself. Some kills live longer than the killer - but only when done right.

#### MeleeAOEStrikeDuelist4
"Anywhere else, you'd kill from the shadows. But this is Trarthus - so we shout murder from the rooftops." - Ratha Azadi

#### MeleeAOEStrikeDuelist5
Would-be sadists flocked to House Azadi, seeking kin in their band of killers. But only a select few rose above the chaff.

#### MeleeAOEStrikeDuelist7
Among Azadi's best, the mark mattered less than the method. To kill without flair was crude - commonplace.

#### MeleeAOEStrikeDuelist8
A name etched in blood is still a name. Many Azadins died trying to earn theirs.

#### MeleeAOEStrikeDuelist9
Azadi's finest were known for rivalry as much as skill. On one occasion, both died trying to outdo the other - while their mark fled.

#### MeleeAOEStrikeDuelist10
Audacious though they may be, Azadins don't advertise. They let their work speak for itself.

#### MeleeAOEStrikeDuelist11
Failure rang loudest of all. A botched kill meant the replacement made an example - of both target and Azadin.

#### MeleeAOEStrikeDuelist12
"Anyone can kill. We give death a name, a face, a reputation." - Ratha Azadi

#### MeleeAOEStrikeDuelist13
"Those bloody Azadins... Could kill twice the people in half the time if they weren't so obsessed with 'artistry'." - Ixan Keita

#### MeleeAOEStrikeDuelistNoble1
"Who needs paint, when blood spills so beautifully?" - {0} Azadi

#### MeleeAOEStrikeDuelistNoble2
{0} Azadi's blade did more than silence. It left an impression.

#### MeleeAOEStrikeDuelistNoble3
{0} Azadi: proof that his House's legacy wasn't written in history - but carved into flesh.

#### MeleeAOEStrikeDuelistNoble4
Tyndarus tried to sail reinforcements west, but the Ezomytes burned his ships in the night, and supplied poisoned grain at port.

#### MeleeAOEStrikeDuelistNoble5
"Trarthus didn't even ask the Ezomytes to aid them in the uprising. Those beautiful poetic bastards did it all on their own."

#### TrapsMinesShadow1
The children of Korathin don't play in fields. They play in slag.

#### TrapsMinesShadow2
The fields were quiet. The factories never were. One bred men. The other broke them.

#### TrapsMinesShadow3
A Trarthan farmer's back bends with harvest. A cityman's with hunger.

#### TrapsMinesShadow4
To the cityfolk, a broken tool is replaced. To the peasant, it's a week lost.

#### TrapsMinesShadow5
The fields breed silence. The cities breed noise. Neither understands the other's music.

#### TrapsMinesShadow6
"Out in the country, a harvest is shared. Here in the city, it's sold - then stolen back."

#### TrapsMinesShadow9
Korathin's smog doesn't just fill the sky. It seeps behind the eyes.

#### TrapsMinesShadow10
A thousand chimneys mark the skyline - monuments to what Trarthus built, and what it buried.

#### TrapsMinesShadow12
No songs are sung in Korathin factories. Just the rhythm of toil and breaking backs.

#### TrapsMinesShadowNoble1
Though rotten to the bone, Trarthus still shelters those the world cast aside.

#### TrapsMinesShadowNoble2
A Mirror of Delirium cracked {0} Azadi's mind like glass - or so the story goes.

#### TrapsMinesShadowNoble3
To House Azadi, {0} is a relic. To everyone else, a warning.

#### TrapsMinesShadowNoble4
"The moment the four Great Founders actually won their war of independence, tensions began to rise between them."

#### TrapsMinesShadowNoble5
"The four great Founders were only allies out of necessity. It didn't take much for their hard-won independence to fall apart."

#### Crit1HShadow1
Azadi was last to rise among the major Houses. Where killing was common, no one paid for it - until Azadi cornered the market.

#### Crit1HShadow2
At first, anyone could kill for coin. House Azadi made the kill itself worth paying for.

#### Crit1HShadow3
Independent killers didn't last. Clients knew: hire Azadi, or become their next contract.

#### Crit1HShadow4
"When palms need greasing, you go to House Bardiya. When heads need rolling, you send for House Azadi."

#### Crit1HShadow5
"A masterful blend of audacity and discretion - that's the Azadi trademark. You'll know who made the kill, never who paid for it."

#### Crit1HShadow6
Azadi's true currency wasn't coin. It was reputation. And reputation, once wounded, bled.

#### Crit1HShadow7
Azadi contracts came sealed in wax. To break the seal was to accept the mark - and the consequences of failure.

#### Crit1HShadow8
Each Azadi contract was coded - names obscured, motives buried. But the message was always the same: kill.

#### Crit1HShadow9
Some left trophies. Others left warnings. But all Azadins left a message: the job was done - and the debt had been paid.

#### Crit1HShadow10
"Everyone knows: renege on Azadi, and become their next target."

#### Crit1HShadow11
"To last in House Azadi, you need to be dead inside - or skilled at making others so. Preferably both."

#### Crit1HShadow13
"In Trarthus, life is cheap. We made sure death wasn't." - Ratha Azadi

#### Crit1HShadowNoble1
{0} Azadi's was not a style. It was a standard - silent, surgical, untraceable.

#### Crit1HShadowNoble2
Where other Azadi painted death in crimson arcs, {0} delivered it with a whisper.

#### Crit1HShadowNoble3
In a House that prized spectacle, {0} Azadi offered none - only results.

#### Crit1HShadowNoble4
"Trarthans never forget a debt. When the Ezomytes rebelled against the Empire, even though centuries had passed, we came to their aid."

#### Crit1HShadowNoble5
"Once our debts were paid to the Ezomytes and the Karui, we considered ourselves even. After that... well, might makes right."

#### MiscScion1
The Merchant Council gave Trarthus a mask of order. Those who can't wear it are cast out.

#### MiscScion2
Though they would not rule for years, the Bardiyans helped shape Trarthus - quiet power moving behind every deal and coin exchange.

#### MiscScion3
The first Bardiyan vault was carved into Korathin's bedrock - long before the city rose above it.

#### MiscScion4
While the Keitans laid stone, the Bardiyans moved coin. One built a city in broad daylight. The other ran it from the shadows.

#### MiscScion5
Before the wars, there was trade. Keitan muscle, Bardiyan mind. Neither trusted the other - but both saw profit.

#### MiscScion6
No two Trarthan forefathers were more opposed - in ideology or in temperament - than Ixan Keita and Quilon Bardiya.

#### MiscScion7
Keita and Bardiya's rivalry erupted across Trarthus - supply lines cut, coin vanished, and not a single soldier raised.

#### MiscScion8
Keita demanded tribute. Bardiya and Azadi refused. The result: starvation, sabotage, and blood in the streets of Korathin.

#### MiscScion9
Bardiya won their struggle with Keita. Coin proved more vital to Trarthus than all the slaves Keita could whip into labour.

#### MiscScion10
Bardiya's victory over Keita came at a cost. From that pyrrhic win grew the Merchant Council - cooperative in name, Bardiyan in truth.

#### MiscScion11
House Bardiya remains as its forefather left it: clever, conniving, and always listening.

#### MiscScion12
"A whisper in the right ear is stronger than any army." - Quilon Bardiya

#### MiscScion13
"To rule through fear is to court your own demise. A frightened animal lashes out. A contended one purrs in your lap." - Quilon Bardiya

#### MiscScion14
"Bardiyans are clever, aye - but so ruthlessly self-serving it's a wonder their banquets don't end in blood."

#### MiscScionNoble1
{0} was born into Bardiyan silk and silver - until a sibling whispered her inheritance away...

#### MiscScionNoble2
{0} Bardiya's legacy was stolen. Her appetite remains.

#### MiscScionNoble3
Betrayal is currency in House Bardiya. {0} has never left a ledger unsettled.

#### MiscScionNoble4
The Eternal Empire stopped exiling people to Trarthus after 872 IC. They began building island prisons closer to home instead.

#### MiscScionNoble5
"The Empire essentially cut contact with Trarthus for five hundred years... until Chitus wanted our powder."

#### AurasMinionsTemplarNobleNeon1
'A ruckus that is made, may not be unmade.' - Trarthan Code Appendice XII
