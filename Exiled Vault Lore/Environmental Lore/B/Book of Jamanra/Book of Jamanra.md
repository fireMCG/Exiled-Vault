## Book of Jamanra
Our people have lived in the shadows of the dunes for too long. Countless generations have been forgotten, will be forgotten. We are not 'Faridun,' we are Maraketh, and if we work together if we unite then they will be forced to acknowledge us. We must show them that casting us off is a mistake. We must show them our strength. Perhaps we can one day rebuild Keth itself, for all those who live in the Plains of Vastiri.
