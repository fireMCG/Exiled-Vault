## Maligaro's Manifesto
My interest in this world is dwindling. Most children begin their lives wide-eyed, amazed at what this world has to offer. I have always been different. Since the day I was born I've been searching for the new, the surprising, that which disturbs both senses and mind. Oh to be an artist! What a lamentable task. Not seeing the world as it is, but as it should be. Peace is the worst of it! A disgusting state of stagnation, fit only for the weak and vapid. War, confusion, terror. Love and passion, these things are closest the world gets to being interesting and alas, I have felt them all. Yet all these pale in comparison to the delightful chaos I have envisioned for this poor, dull world.
