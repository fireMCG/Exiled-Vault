## ~~Fearful Letter~~
To Provost Connal Preas: The Count's 'interest' in his heritage has grown into mania. At first, I thought our alliance with the outsiders was beneficial, but now I believe Ogham may be in great danger. The Manor's soldiers have been ordered to rip up the floor and dig, and I fear what they found beneath the layer of ash they hit this morning; twisted shapes, ancient agonies cast in stone, horrible proof of some event of colossal horror that burned the sky... I slipped away, that I might write to you. You were right. I was wrong. Gather the village men as you planned. There is one final task I must endure for the Count, but when I return from the Eternal graveyard, I will give you entrance to the Manor in the dead of night, so that the Count can be secured and this madness put to an end. This is not a betrayal, it is a rescue. It is what our Lord needs to regain his sense. It is what we all need to quell our troubled dreams. And that Maraketh wife of his, that Whisperer of Paranoias and Hatreds... I shall leave her fate up to you, Provost. Lachlann, Head Servant of Ogham Manor
