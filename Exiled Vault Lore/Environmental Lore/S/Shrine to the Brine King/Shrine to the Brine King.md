## Shrine to the Brine King
O' Lord of Salt and Scale, your servants attend to thee. Praise thee Tsoagoth! Without life yet living, the Brine King sleeps. We send our prayers to thee, so that you might eternally slumber. O' great one, we offer up this human soul as slave for you in your drowned city. Take this life and bid the seas be calm and plentiful. Woe to the Sailor who does not offer tribute to thee! Such a man is cast off from our ocean kingdom! He shall be made pariah, with neither captain nor commission. Judge us not by unworthy sails, Look to us as your servants. Your kin of salt and scale. O' praise thee Tsoagoth, praise thee!
