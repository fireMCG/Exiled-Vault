So many have scrutinised the inner workings of the heart, written entire books on sadness, love and hate. Yet terror is the truest, purest of all human emotions. Terror is what we have once our earthly facades are stripped away, once we are naked, vulnerable savages in a vast and uncaring wilderness. Civilisation is a costume, worn to conceal our truest natures. Oh, that we could all become terrified children once again!
