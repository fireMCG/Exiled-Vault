## Eroded Inscription
The weary traveler grows close to the end of the path! The breadbowl of the world, the verdant Land of Seven Waters, awaits! Be sure to have your toll ready at the Gates. Cloth, gems, metal wares, and coin are all accepted.
## Sand-blasted Inscription
The weary traveler has reached the end of the path! Welcome to the City of Seven Waters, whence bounty springs! Behold our lush plains and verdant forests, blessed to feed empires far and wide. Eat, drink, and be fat at your leisure, so long as you take word back to your homeland of the glory of Keth!
