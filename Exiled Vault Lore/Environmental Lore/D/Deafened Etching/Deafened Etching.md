## Deafened Etching
I will never sleep again. My fellow journeymen lie twisted on the path, their faces forever locked in pale silent screams. She screamed... she screamed! I felt it, in my soul! My fellows... they died in agony... but I had a small dagger, and I... I did the only thing I could, to stop myself from hearing that death knell... I left them there. I cannot go back. Forgive me, my brothers. Forgive me...
