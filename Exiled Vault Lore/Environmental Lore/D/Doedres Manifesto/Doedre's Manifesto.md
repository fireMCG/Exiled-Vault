## Doedre's Manifesto
#### Read
Peel back the skin, for there are secrets in sinew. Mysteries in muscle. Plunder the intestinal fortress, reach deep into bowels of power. The esoterica of kings lies not in the mind, but in the beating walls of a bloodied heart! The wonders of the universe are screamed from the ramparts of our fleshly fortresses. Shall the meat show us holiness? Oh, how I feel the tingling of our sacred bodies pressed together, tight and fluid. Let the meat show us the way. Hail the meat, praise the meat. The meat is both debasement and divinity alike. The meat shall lead us down the path to true enlightenment.
