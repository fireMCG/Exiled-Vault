I do know a way out. If we fail, and the Empire falls, I have one last resort. I fear it, but it is my last hope. We imprisoned Ichlotl the Blackjaw in a Soul Core, alone, for his crimes. Isolated like that, without any other souls in the lattice, his stone form seemed to retain much of his personality. Do I dare drain my own lifeblood into something we used as a punishment worse than death? We have toiled so long to defeat death, all I know now is fear... if the sky turns to blood, if flames consume Utzaal, only then will I decide.
