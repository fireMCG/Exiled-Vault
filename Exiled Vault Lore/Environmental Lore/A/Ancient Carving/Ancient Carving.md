## Ancient Carving
When we first came to this place, Death alone was the King of all that we surveyed, solemn in his high and lonely throne. We had little, and were starving, but this man-made mountain offered us nourishment. Eating the caps and stems brought us grand visions of a thriving world. It was a promise of things to be. This, then, will be our new home until our promised land is made real.
