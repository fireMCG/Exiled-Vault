## Witch - PoE1 Dialogue
#### Witch1
The very sand shivers with malice. There's a power here that welcomes me.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch1.ogg]]

#### Witch2
I'd rather burn than call such a place home.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch2.ogg]]

#### Witch3
The sirens appear to be dining well.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch3.ogg]]

#### Witch4
The air stinks of thaumaturgy. I could learn a thing or two here.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch4.ogg]]

#### Witch5
Sad creatures in dark corners... seems they've been sad for a very long time.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch5.ogg]]

#### Witch6
I'd love to see the insides of this spell. I can't abide housework.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch6.ogg]]

#### Witch7
The dead will soon rise for me, not against me.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch7.ogg]]

#### Witch8
Had you been my creation, brute, you'd not have fallen so easily.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch8.ogg]]

#### Witch9
And that's how you die properly, sailor boy. No half-measures, thank you.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch9.ogg]]

#### Witch10
Poor fishwife! 'Twas love that did this to you.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch10.ogg]]

#### Witch11
This land has no time for avaricious little despots like you, Oak.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch11.ogg]]

#### Witch12
It's kind of disappointing, really. I usually like rats.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch12.ogg]]

#### Witch13
You missed a valuable lesson, Sister. Never let the power go to your head.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch13.ogg]]

#### Witch14
A pity. I think we could've been friends.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch14.ogg]]

#### Witch15
You wanted me burned back in Oriath, Gravicius. That wasn't very nice.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch15.ogg]]

#### Witch16
I loved your work, Piety. It was you I wasn't very fond of.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch16.ogg]]

#### Witch17
No-one will cry for you, Dominus. Not a soul.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch17.ogg]]

#### Witch18
How fascinating.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch18.ogg]]

#### Witch19
A moment to catch my breath.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch19.ogg]]

#### Witch20
I need more mana.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch20.ogg]]

#### Witch21
Too. Much. Clutter.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch21.ogg]]

#### Witch22
Ah, satisfying indeed.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch22.ogg]]

#### Witch23
Life is fleeting!
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch23.ogg]]

#### Witch24
I've not the muscle for that.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch24.ogg]]

#### Witch25
I'm perplexed about that one.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch25.ogg]]

#### Witch26
I'll need to be more lithe for that.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch26.ogg]]

#### Witch27
This item whispers of destiny.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch27.ogg]]

#### Witch28
That would just make life complicated.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch28.ogg]]

#### Witch29
And I thought I'd be a dead woman by now.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch29.ogg]]

#### Witch30
To learn is to live.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch30.ogg]]

#### Witch31
I think this Wraeclast will serve.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch31.ogg]]

#### Witch32
Fate smiles with sharp teeth.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch32.ogg]]

#### Witch33
I barely recognise myself.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch33.ogg]]

#### Witch34
The very land learns to heed my demands.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch34.ogg]]

#### Witch35
I no longer need fear. Destiny has seen to that.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch35.ogg]]

#### Witch36
I know that stench. Just like my sisters... upon the pyre.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch36.ogg]]

#### Witch37
It's nice to see there's still some life in this twitching corpse of a continent.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch37.ogg]]

#### Witch38
Sarn, the city that gave birth to an empire. Oh, you have so much to answer for.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch38.ogg]]

#### Witch39
When you build something like this, you make persecution a way of life.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch39.ogg]]

#### Witch40
Poor sailor boy. Doomed to go wherever the winds blow him.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch40.ogg]]

#### Witch41
Remember, Dominus. What goes up, must come down.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch41.ogg]]

#### Witch42
That water just reeks of corruption. Let's see where it comes from.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch42.ogg]]

#### Witch43
How do I keep ending up in such lovely places?
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch43.ogg]]

#### Witch44
Thaumaturgy just keeps getting the better of you, doesn't it Voll?
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch44.ogg]]

#### Witch45
Yes, little mountain. I'm pleased to see you too!
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch45.ogg]]

#### Witch46
I think it likes me.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch46.ogg]]

#### Witch47
There are so many more trapped spirits in this place. I can feel them.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch47.ogg]]

#### Witch48
Don't be frightened little mountain. It'll all be over soon.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch48.ogg]]

#### Witch49
I'm sorry to have to break this to you, Daresso, but... she's not real.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch49.ogg]]

#### Witch50
So this is what the inside of a Karui king's head looks like. I hope they're not all like this.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch50.ogg]]

#### Witch51
Now that's what you get for losing your temper, Kaom.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch51.ogg]]

#### Witch52
It's not every day you get to walk into a living, breathing nightmare.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch52.ogg]]

#### Witch53
It seems I've underestimated Piety. Good! I like surprises.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch53.ogg]]

#### Witch54
I hate to be critical, but... I've seen better.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch54.ogg]]

#### Witch55
After Brutus, I'm glad I won't be seeing any more of your work.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch55.ogg]]

#### Witch56
Oh, Doedre. We witches have to have some standards.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch56.ogg]]

#### Witch57
I hope he doesn't listen, Piety. That'll make it even more fun!
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch57.ogg]]

#### Witch58
Poor Malachai, you were so frightened of Death, weren't you? Now the two of you can get better acquainted. It's really not so bad once you get to know it.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch58.ogg]]

#### Witch59
When I'm ready and not before.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch59.ogg]]

#### Witch61
Life is short. Deal with it.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch61.ogg]]

#### Witch62
Oops! Clumsy me.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch62.ogg]]

#### Witch63
Everything dies.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch63.ogg]]

#### Witch64
I like you better this way.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch64.ogg]]

#### Witch65
Life is too precious to waste on you.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch65.ogg]]

#### Witch66
You either master Nightmare, or it masters you.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Witch66.ogg]]

#### WitchHeadingHomeA4
Seems I've mastered Wraeclast. Time to return to Oriath with a vengeance.
![[Witch - PoE1 - WitchHeadingHomeA4.ogg]]

#### WitchEnterSlavePens
I'm going to show them how right they were to fear me.
![[Witch - PoE1 - WitchEnterSlavePens.ogg]]

#### WitchKillKrow
Is that all? I expected so much more.
![[Witch - PoE1 - WitchKillKrow.ogg]]

#### WitchEnterTownA5
Seems there's a rebellion on. How quaint.
![[Witch - PoE1 - WitchEnterTownA5.ogg]]

#### WitchPickUpMiasmeter
Thaumaturgy and science, combined... that's rather clever.

#### WitchPickUpEyesOfZeal
Look at these beauties... perfect for my collection!
![[Witch - PoE1 - WitchPickUpEyesOfZeal.ogg]]

#### WitchEnterOriathA5
These people have no idea their time is almost up.
![[Witch - PoE1 - WitchEnterOriathA5.ogg]]

#### WitchEnterTemplarCourts
I swore they would suffer for exiling me, and I always keep my promises.
![[Witch - PoE1 - WitchEnterTemplarCourts.ogg]]

#### WitchEnterChamberOfInnocence
Something's here... something... different...
![[Witch - PoE1 - WitchEnterChamberOfInnocence.ogg]]

#### WitchInnocenceEmerges
That power... incredible!
![[Witch - PoE1 - WitchInnocenceEmerges.ogg]]

#### WitchMeetSinInnocence
I've conquered one god already. What's one more?
![[Witch - PoE1 - WitchMeetSinInnocence.ogg]]

#### WitchEnterTorchedCourts
Someone's redecorated. I like it.
![[Witch - PoE1 - WitchEnterTorchedCourts.ogg]]

#### WitchKillCato
You testified against me, 'scholar,' while you yourself were secretly corrupted. Typical.
![[Witch - PoE1 - WitchKillCato.ogg]]

#### WitchEnterRuinedSquareA5
This chaos... should have been of my making.
![[Witch - PoE1 - WitchEnterRuinedSquareA5.ogg]]

#### WitchKillUtula
Oriath was mine to burn. You took that from me. Now, you will join the pyre.
![[Witch - PoE1 - WitchKillUtula.ogg]]

#### WitchEnterOssuary
Had I the time, I could raise an endless legion from these bones. Pity.

Alchemy and black thaumaturgy... you sure know how to lift my spirits.

Hopefully, I can learn from my mistakes this time.
![[Witch - PoE1 - WitchEnterCoastA6.ogg]]

#### WitchRespondToNessaOne
I'm not really in the habit of saving people, but I'll see what I can do.
![[Witch - PoE1 - WitchRespondToNessaOne.ogg]]

#### WitchMeetSinTukohama
This spark... exquisite!
![[Witch - PoE1 - WitchMeetSinTukohama.ogg]]

#### WitchEnterPrisonA6
I must have jinxed myself. Here we go again...
![[Witch - PoE1 - WitchEnterPrisonA6.ogg]]

#### WitchSeesBrutusA6
Brutus again? That shoddy creation barely put up a fight the first time.
![[Witch - PoE1 - WitchSeesBrutusA6.ogg]]

#### WitchKillShavronneA6
It seems those who don't learn from their mistakes are doomed to repeat them.
![[Witch - PoE1 - WitchKillShavronneA6.ogg]]

#### WitchMeetSinAbberath
Between alchemy and thaumaturgy, I'll bet on thaumaturgy every time.

That's not the Azmeri! They're gone!
![[Witch - PoE1 - WitchSeesAzmeriGone.ogg]]

#### WitchRespondToNessaTwo
Trap?... trap.
![[Witch - PoE1 - WitchRespondToNessaTwo.ogg]]

#### WitchEnterBrineKingReef
So, Divinity doesn't just reshape the self. It changes the world around you, too...

This place... flows forth from a dark mind, thought by thought...
![[Witch - PoE1 - WitchEnterMaligaroSanctuaryA7.ogg]]

#### WitchKillMaligaroA7
I didn't give you enough credit, Maligaro. This place, this energy... I've learned something new!
![[Witch - PoE1 - WitchKillMaligaroA7.ogg]]

#### WitchEnterAshenFields
Why do they always resort to fire?
![[Witch - PoE1 - WitchEnterAshenFields.ogg]]

You should have kept him how he was... I would have.

I like your style, Olesya.
![[Witch - PoE1 - WitchMeetOlesya.ogg]]

#### Dom_Intro_Witch.ogg
Why do the keen of mind seek to satiate their curiosity in darkness and depravity? Innocence is our Father, Oriath is our Mother. When a daughter strays from the light, she makes herself an orphan. Learn well the lessons that Wraeclast will teach you, Witch. It is your only hope of finding your way home.
![[Witch - PoE1 - Dom_Intro_Witch.ogg.ogg]]
