## Divinia Dialogue
#### DiviniaAct2FellshrineQuest
I am Divinia, a Templar academic and relic enthusiast. This little settlement is... quaint. Not the most respectable place, but I'm grateful that they've given me a warm welcome. I've been waiting for a fellow explorer to make their way here. I've discovered an abandoned Templar enclave beneath the ruins of Fellshrine. Will you join me in uncovering its secrets?
![[Divinia - DiviniaAct2FellshrineQuest.ogg]]

#### DiviniaAct2OnFellshrine
Investigating this historical site is not an opportunity I can afford to miss, although it may be dangerous. It's fortunate that you're here.
![[Divinia - DiviniaAct2OnFellshrine.ogg]]

#### DiviniaAct2OnEramir
Eramir is very kindly. We were discussing holy scripture, and he had many enlightening things to say. Our conversation brought a fresh perspective.
![[Divinia - DiviniaAct2OnEramir.ogg]]

#### DiviniaAct2OnGreust
Greust seems... wholly unsavoury. He spat on me!
![[Divinia - DiviniaAct2OnGreust.ogg]]

#### DiviniaAct2OnHelenaIfPresent
I recognise Helena from many years ago. We met during our studies, having pursued similar fields of research. I've always thought fondly of her.
![[Divinia - DiviniaAct2OnHelenaIfPresent.ogg]]

#### [DNT] The Sanctum
It's wonderful to see a fellow explorer! What a stroke of good luck. My name is Divinia – I am a Templar academic and relic enthusiast. I have stumbled upon an abandoned Templar enclave beneath the Fellshrine Ruins, not far from here. Will you join me in uncovering its secrets?
![[Divinia - [DNT] The Sanctum.ogg]]

#### DiviniaFellshrineRuinsIntroductionIfForestEncampment
This may be a grim place, but it's an important historical site. We're not far from the Sanctum now. Let's make our way there.
![[Divinia - DiviniaFellshrineRuinsIntroductionIfForestEncampment.ogg]]

#### DiviniaOnFellshrineRuinsWhileFollowingPlayer
This place is truly something to behold. History took place here, in these very wetlands. Archbishop Geofri, Maligaro the Inquisitor... They were real people, accomplishing real things that stood the test of time. It's like history is coming to life, and we are witnessing it firsthand.
![[Divinia - DiviniaOnFellshrineRuinsWhileFollowingPlayer.ogg]]

#### DiviniaFellshrineRuinsSanctumSighted
That's it! The Sanctum. I can't believe we're here at last. We should make our way inside.
![[Divinia - DiviniaFellshrineRuinsSanctumSighted.ogg]]

#### DiviniaFellshrineRuinsEntranceBarrierBroken
Let's delve into history, shall we?
![[Divinia - DiviniaFellshrineRuinsEntranceBarrierBroken.ogg]]

#### DiviniaSanctumEntranceCommentOnSanctum
This place is... well, decrepit. But it's a bastion of knowledge. Ancient Templars once walked these very halls. Who knows what we'll find...
![[Divinia - DiviniaSanctumEntranceCommentOnSanctum.ogg]]

#### DiviniaSanctumEntranceCommentOnSanctumAlternate
It's a little odd that this place seems so... 'lived-in'. I thought it was abandoned, and lost to living memory.
![[Divinia - DiviniaSanctumEntranceCommentOnSanctumAlternate.ogg]]

#### Relics
What really excites me is the possibility of finding relics here. I mean, think of the historical and archaeological implications! We might glean true insight into ancient Templar history... a lot can be inferred from their burial practices, their scripture, their artefacts. We might even unearth the truth about why this Sanctum is here at all.
![[Divinia - Relics.ogg]]

#### DiviniaSanctumEntranceRelicDeviceSighted
This chantry... It must be a Templar device of some kind. There are engraved hollows within it, seemingly intended for artefacts. If you arrange relics on the chantry, you may invoke some kind of holy power.
![[Divinia - DiviniaSanctumEntranceRelicDeviceSighted.ogg]]

#### DiviniaSanctumEntranceRelicDeviceQuestComplete
Here, take this relic I found. It may prove useful.
![[Divinia - DiviniaSanctumEntranceRelicDeviceQuestComplete.ogg]]

#### DiviniaSanctumEntranceRelicDeviceQuestCompleteAlternate
You're... faintly glowing? And rather less dusty. Seems like you really are drawing on something sacred.
![[Divinia - DiviniaSanctumEntranceRelicDeviceQuestCompleteAlternate.ogg]]

#### Secret Heresies
I couldn't imagine renouncing a path of righteousness. I spent decades rifling through papyrus in the Archives, and being here is like seeing it all come to life.
![[Divinia - Secret Heresies.ogg]]

#### DiviniaSanctumEntranceOnSanctum
I'm so happy to be here... though this place does send shivers down my spine. I'm glad you're here – the very thought of fighting turns my stomach.
![[Divinia - DiviniaSanctumEntranceOnSanctum.ogg]]

#### Fellshrine Ruins
It's strange to think that we're beneath the Fellshrine Ruins themselves; a vital part of Wraeclastian history, where heroism and atrocities took place.
![[Divinia - Fellshrine Ruins.ogg]]

#### Archbishop Geofri
I still remember where I was when I read about the fate of Archbishop Geofri. I wouldn't wish it upon anyone.
![[Divinia - Archbishop Geofri.ogg]]

#### DiviniaMerchantMinorBoonPurchasedRandom
This should help... a bit.
![[Divinia - DiviniaMerchantMinorBoonPurchasedRandom.ogg]]

#### DiviniaMerchantMinorBoonPurchased4
One step closer.
![[Divinia - DiviniaMerchantMinorBoonPurchased4.ogg]]

#### DiviniaMerchantMinorBoonPurchased8
Every little bit helps.
![[Divinia - DiviniaMerchantMinorBoonPurchased8.ogg]]

#### DiviniaMerchantMinorBoonPurchased12
Good luck.
![[Divinia - DiviniaMerchantMinorBoonPurchased12.ogg]]

#### DiviniaMerchantMajorBoonPurchasedRandom
An awe-inspiring power.
![[Divinia - DiviniaMerchantMajorBoonPurchasedRandom.ogg]]

#### DiviniaMerchantMajorBoonPurchased14
Miraculous.
![[Divinia - DiviniaMerchantMajorBoonPurchased14.ogg]]

#### DiviniaMerchantMajorBoonPurchased5
Truly, a gift.
![[Divinia - DiviniaMerchantMajorBoonPurchased5.ogg]]

#### DiviniaMerchantMajorBoonPurchased8
Blessed by divine forces.
![[Divinia - DiviniaMerchantMajorBoonPurchased8.ogg]]

#### DiviniaMerchantRelicPurchasedRandom
A fine choice.
![[Divinia - DiviniaMerchantRelicPurchasedRandom.ogg]]

#### DiviniaMerchantRelicPurchased4
May it serve you well.
![[Divinia - DiviniaMerchantRelicPurchased4.ogg]]

#### DiviniaMerchantRelicPurchased7
See how it shines in the light?
![[Divinia - DiviniaMerchantRelicPurchased7.ogg]]

#### DiviniaMerchantRelicPurchased11
Use it wisely.
![[Divinia - DiviniaMerchantRelicPurchased11.ogg]]

#### DiviniaMerchantMajorBoonAffectingMerchant_A1
I'm having a good day, so the prices are better than usual.
![[Divinia - DiviniaMerchantMajorBoonAffectingMerchant_A1.ogg]]

#### DiviniaMerchantMinorBoonAffectingMerchant_A1
I'll give you a better price than usual today.
![[Divinia - DiviniaMerchantMinorBoonAffectingMerchant_A1.ogg]]

#### DiviniaMerchantMinorBoonAffectingMerchant_B1
I almost feel compelled to give you these for free. But not quite.
![[Divinia - DiviniaMerchantMinorBoonAffectingMerchant_B1.ogg]]

#### DiviniaMerchantMinorAfflictionAffectingMerchant_A1
Um... There's an extra surcharge today. You got blood on my clothes.
![[Divinia - DiviniaMerchantMinorAfflictionAffectingMerchant_A1.ogg]]

#### DiviniaMerchantMajorAfflictionAffectingMerchant_A1
You expect me to sell you this ancient relic... for that price? Dream on!
![[Divinia - DiviniaMerchantMajorAfflictionAffectingMerchant_A1.ogg]]

#### DiviniaMerchantMajorAfflictionAffectingMerchant_B1
You've got to be joking!
![[Divinia - DiviniaMerchantMajorAfflictionAffectingMerchant_B1.ogg]]

#### DiviniaAct7FellshrineSanctum
Something seems different in the Sanctum beneath Fellshrine. I think you should go and investigate it for yourself.
![[Divinia - DiviniaAct7FellshrineSanctum.ogg]]

#### DiviniaAct7OnWildlife
Every time I took a stroll in the wilderness, I encountered vicious, mutated animals. It seems that the effects of the Cataclysm aren't solely limited to people.
![[Divinia - DiviniaAct7OnWildlife.ogg]]

#### DiviniaAct7OnGreust
The man who spat on me is now leading brigands? I'd believe it.
![[Divinia - DiviniaAct7OnGreust.ogg]]

#### DiviniaAct7OnSupplyShortages
I miss the bittersweet tang of oranges. We can't grow them anymore, for even the soil is corrupted.
![[Divinia - DiviniaAct7OnSupplyShortages.ogg]]

#### Exploring the Sanctum
This may not be the most pleasant of places, but I brought you here to assist in exploring its depths. Unlike you, I'm not especially battle-hardened, and I need someone to be the muscle behind this operation. I'll be the brains. No offence.
![[Divinia - Exploring the Sanctum.ogg]]

#### DiviniaUniqueRelic
A truly miraculous find.
![[Divinia - DiviniaUniqueRelic.ogg]]

#### DiviniaBoonsAutoTriggered
You seem to be suffused with some form of beneficial magic. It will likely prove useful in this dark place. Though the magic doesn't seem to be of Templar origin... I wonder where it comes from?
![[Divinia - DiviniaBoonsAutoTriggered.ogg]]

#### DiviniaAfterFloorBoss1
You fought animated stonework and lived to tell the tale... and you heard a woman's voice speaking through it? This reeks of lithomancy, and powerful arcane forces. Tread carefully here, Exile.
![[Divinia - DiviniaAfterFloorBoss1.ogg]]

#### DiviniaAfterFloorBoss2
The woman spoke to you again through the monstrosities you defeated? It seems as if they were her creations. She's likely experimenting with necromancy as well as lithomancy. It seems no coincidence that this is a Templar site, and necromancy is often practised by powerful Templar heretics. This woman was likely formerly a Templar, experimenting with unholy magic and delving into arcane secrets best left untouched.
![[Divinia - DiviniaAfterFloorBoss2.ogg]]

#### DiviniaAfterFloorBoss3
You heard her voice again, through the undead horror you did battle with? This confirms my suspicions – there is undoubtedly necromancy at work here. Something big is coming, no doubt something vile and unholy. Stay vigilant, Exile. Be on your guard.
![[Divinia - DiviniaAfterFloorBoss3.ogg]]

#### DiviniaPreLycia
I have been exploring the surrounding halls, albeit with caution. I can't put my finger on it, but there is a powerful sense that something is 'not quite right' on this floor. The way in which the crypts are positioned seems unorthodox, and the creatures I encounter are vicious and agitated. It's almost like they're guarding something... protecting something...
![[Divinia - DiviniaPreLycia.ogg]]

#### DiviniaLyciaFoughtButNotDefeated
You found and faced Lycia herself? This confirms that she has a physical form – I wondered if she might be some kind of spirit or dark incorporeal entity, but this is clearly not the case. If she has been experimenting with necromancy, this may not be the last we'll see of her. She could have discovered some arcane secret that grants her extended life. Face her again, Exile. Cut off her head this time!
![[Divinia - DiviniaLyciaFoughtButNotDefeated.ogg]]

#### DiviniaLyciaFoughtAndDefeatedPreTransformation
You defeated Lycia? Brilliantly done, Exile. The Sanctum seems unaffected, and her presence is still endemic. She might truly have discovered the secret of immortality. We need to find out more. I'll keep researching, Exile, and you keep exploring. We'll uncover the truth of all this.
![[Divinia - DiviniaLyciaFoughtAndDefeatedPreTransformation.ogg]]

#### DiviniaLyciaFoughtButNotDefeatedTransformationNotSeen
So, it's true. Lycia has returned, despite being defeated. From your account, she's stronger this time, too. Try to find her and face her again. Vile magic is at work here, and we cannot allow it to run rampant.
![[Divinia - DiviniaLyciaFoughtButNotDefeatedTransformationNotSeen.ogg]]

#### DiviniaLyciaFoughtButNotDefeatedTransformationSeen
Lycia transformed? And she called out the name Beidat... You have to get back to her, Exile. You must stop her at all costs. I fear that something truly unholy is at work here, something that may endanger all of Wraeclast. I must get back to my research, and let you know more when I'm certain.
![[Divinia - DiviniaLyciaFoughtButNotDefeatedTransformationSeen.ogg]]

#### Lycia's Deal
Lycia transforming and calling out the name Beidat confirms my worst fears. In my research of her occult activities, I found mention of a ravenous horde of horrific demons that exist in some other form of reality, constantly trying to reach us to consume us. It's a secret known only to the line of High Templars and their keepers of the forbidden. They sought means of power to resist them, should the day come that they find a way into our world... but she must have reached out to the Scourge and made a deal...
![[Divinia - Lycia's Deal.ogg]]

#### Lycia
In a sense, what happened to Lycia is sad. She chose an unholy path out of spite, knowing the Templar preachings to be riddled with fallacies. And she chose immortality out of a desire to not be forgotten, enduring centuries of isolation as a result. She is not blameless, but Beidat was the true culprit. That self-proclaimed 'archangel,' that {fiend}, enticed Lycia into the deal that prolonged her life, and used her to gain a foothold in Wraeclast. I shudder to think of what will happen if he garners more power. These ever-changing halls are still permeated with Lycia's magic. She is not gone. She still has dominion over this place. I implore you to keep exploring the Sanctum, and killing Lycia too, if you have the fortitude to. We will never know the specifics of her deal with Beidat, but if she manages to open the door to this world, the Scourge will bring horror to every living person on Wraeclast. She is truly immortal, so all we can do is delay her, but every time she is slain, you buy us time to work on a more permanent solution.
![[Divinia - Lycia.ogg]]

#### The Scourge
I have only seen mention of the Scourge in the most forbidden texts of my order. The High Templars kept the secret to themselves. There are demons all around us, eternally trying to enter our world. If they manage to manifest themselves here more than temporarily, they will ravage Wraeclast and consume every living thing. Needless to say, we cannot let that happen.
![[Divinia - The Scourge.ogg]]

#### Beidat
Beidat is one of three Demon Lords of the Scourge. The forbidden texts contain very little information about him outside the collected writings of heretics and the visions of blind seers throughout history, but I do know that he and his ilk are the most 'like us,' in that they think, speak, and can communicate. K'tash and Ghorr, the other two Demon Lords, are far too unlike us to ever be capable of making a deal with someone like Lycia... or us. If it was only Beidat, we might possibly save ourselves by offering Wraeclast as a continent of slaves to serve him, but the other two can never be reasoned with.
![[Divinia - Beidat.ogg]]

#### K'Tash, The Hate Shepherd
Very little is known about K'tash and its ilk. All I have is a written record from a madwoman who mysteriously disappeared from a Templar jail cell a few years ago. She said the name K'tash, and she ranted about the demons not thinking, because many don't even have heads, and that something else does the thinking for them. I shudder at the prospect of such impossible beings.
![[Divinia - K'Tash, The Hate Shepherd.ogg]]

#### Ghorr, The Grasping Maw
They eat. They consume. That is all that they do. They will not show mercy, and they will never relent.
![[Divinia - Ghorr, The Grasping Maw.ogg]]

#### Introduction
This is an absolute disaster! I am Divinia, Adjunct Archivist of the Templar Order. I've returned to Oriath to perform some critical research, but the whole city is in chaos...
![[Divinia - Introduction.ogg]]

#### Aiding an Archivist
I've heard the people here talking about you. Now, if you're going into... that madness, I have a favour to ask of you. Most of the Templars' secret archives have probably been looted or burned by now, but there's one trove only the Master Archivist and I knew about. It's hidden within my order's Ossuary. Now if you can, please go there and search for a particular tome. It's called the Mortinomicon, and supposedly contains everything the Templars know about immortality. I know you're dealing with Kitava and his cultists, but this may be just as important in the long run.
![[Divinia - Aiding an Archivist.ogg]]

#### The Forbidden Sanctum
You actually found it! I can't believe I'm holding, in my very own hands, the Mortinomicon Exitio Immortalis! You really are as capable as I've heard... if you're willing, I'm in dire need of further assistance.
![[Divinia - The Forbidden Sanctum.ogg]]

#### The Forbidden Sanctum_2
You actually found it! I can't believe I'm holding, in my very own hands wait, what is this? It {looks} like the Mortinomicon, but the text is different... the historical references are all wrong... I might sound like a madwoman, but I think you've somehow found a tome from a different possible Wraeclast! This contains vital new information... if you're willing, I'm in dire need of further assistance.
![[Divinia - The Forbidden Sanctum_2.ogg]]

#### Aiding an Archivist_2
With this book, I might just be able to make some headway dealing with a very ancient problem. There's a certain forbidden Sanctum I'd like to show you, hidden under the ruins of Fellshrine for untold centuries. Meet me there when you can. Believe me, this dangerous enigma isn't going anywhere anytime soon. I mean, that's the whole problem with immortality...
![[Divinia - Aiding an Archivist_2.ogg]]

#### The Mortinomicon
The Mortinomicon Exitio Immortalis, as its lengthy name implies, is quite the difficult read. As a layer of extra security, it was written in the ancient language of the newcomers that were instrumental in the founding of our religion. Very few people can speak it, let alone read it. I'm deciphering the language at the same time that I'm translating and researching. It's mentally taxing to the extreme, but I have no choice but to soldier on!
![[Divinia - The Mortinomicon.ogg]]

#### Sin
You can see him, too? I thought I was hallucinating. Wait, you're {working with him?} Do you know who that is? He's the Original Evil! I won't have anything to do with a monster like him!
![[Divinia - Sin.ogg]]

#### Innocence
Do you see that?! God is here! That's him, incarnate! What's he doing with his brother? Has he somehow reconciled with the Original Evil? I'm so very confused right now...
![[Divinia - Innocence.ogg]]

#### Oriath
It's all on fire! It's absolute madness! My heart aches for what they've done to my home, but... I have a duty to perform, or else a worse terror than this might descend upon the entire world...
![[Divinia - Oriath.ogg]]

#### Lani
I don't know her very well, but she seems very determined. I hope she survives all this.
![[Divinia - Lani.ogg]]

#### The Roths
Have you seen their little black cat? I know Oriath is in chaos, but I can't help but feel my spirits lift when I see how cute and unafraid it is! Everything's going to be alright. I just know it.
![[Divinia - The Roths.ogg]]

#### Kitava's Defeat
I knew everything would turn out alright! I had faith in you the entire time.
![[Divinia - Kitava's Defeat.ogg]]

#### Sin_2
After what I've learned in this Sanctum, I should probably re-evaluate my beliefs. I think I understand Lycia's pain. If I've been lied to by the Templars about the foundations of our religion, what else am I wrong about? Perhaps Sin is not the Original Evil that he was claimed to be. I feel strange even considering such a heretical idea!
![[Divinia - Sin_2.ogg]]

#### The Newcomers
In all my research and believe me, I've done more than most I've still never been able to figure out who the newcomers truly were. They learned our language, but theirs has been mostly lost over thousands of years. It has a completely different grammatical structure, too, so translating it is a slow and difficult task. If only I could find that elusive shrine...
![[Divinia - The Newcomers.ogg]]

#### Offer Relic
Do you see that altar? It is capable of changing your relationship with the Sanctum's mystical properties. Here's a relic I found while exploring its depths. Go on, place it in the altar, see what happens.
![[Divinia - Offer Relic.ogg]]

#### The Altar
I can see the energies shifting around you. The relic worked! Keep an eye out for more of them, especially the oldest ones, original artefacts from the time of the very founding of our religion. The Templars built this place to hide them... among other things.
![[Divinia - The Altar.ogg]]

#### Varakath's Defeat
A woman spoke to you through Varakath? Then that means my most recent attempt at breaking the pact failed once again. Her name is Lycia, and she is the darkness at the heart of this place. If you reach the bottom, you will have to face her. Many exiles have gotten that far, but even if you manage to kill her, it doesn't matter. Just like you and me, she's immortal while she's here. If we are ever to truly defeat her, I must use the Mortinomicon's knowledge to break the black pact that makes death here impossible...
![[Divinia - Varakath's Defeat.ogg]]

#### Braom and Uzar's Defeat
Braom and Uzar were Lycia's creations. They, too, will resurrect after a time. While they're down, I'll be able to get past them into the Cathedral. There are certain rituals I want to perform over various relics and lines of power there. I've tried this many times before, but maybe it'll finally succeed... that's what I tell myself every time...
![[Divinia - Braom and Uzar's Defeat.ogg]]

#### Xenathar's Defeat
With Xenathar temporarily down, we can get into the Necropolis proper. Using what I've learned in the Mortinomicon, I'm going to try to sanctify and purify certain wellsprings of dark energy that can be found within. It's just a matter of finding the correct ritual...
![[Divinia - Xenathar's Defeat.ogg]]

#### Lycia's Deal_2
From what I've been able to determine, Lycia made a pact with some dark benefactor from beyond this world. She's been here for centuries, drawing people in and gathering a particular type of energy from unsuspecting explorers. Once she has enough, she'll attempt to bring her benefactor into Wraeclast. I have my suspicions about who, or what, it might be...
![[Divinia - Lycia's Deal_2.ogg]]

#### Facing Lycia
You've almost cleared the way to Lycia herself. I'll prepare my incantations and rituals. If you manage to reach her, I'll be attacking the energies of the black pact directly while you fight her. We don't need to find a permanent solution... if I can manage to disable the Sanctum's immortality even for just a few moments, then Lycia's death will be permanent. That's assuming you can actually defeat her, of course.
![[Divinia - Facing Lycia.ogg]]

#### Lycia's Return
I'm sorry, Exile... my latest iteration of rituals didn't work. The Sanctum seems unaffected, and Lycia's presence is still endemic. She'll be back. I'll keep researching. We'll figure this out before she manages to open Wraeclast to invasion... hopefully.
![[Divinia - Lycia's Return.ogg]]
