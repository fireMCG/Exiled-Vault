## Doryani Dialogue
#### DoryaniPastPostFight
Stop! Stop... I can contain the Beast...!

#### Ancient Weapon
If only I had more time... There is an ancient weapon. A weapon that was used against Corruption, from a civilization lost to the ages. I have one piece of it. Three others were scattered... I have been searching for them, but the Karui have interfered at every turn.
![[Doryani - Ancient Weapon - 1.ogg]]
![[Doryani - Ancient Weapon - 2.ogg]]

#### Communion with the Beast
I suppose I must... It is too late for us here. This era is over. I pleaded with Atziri for her patience... but she would not abide me. She will attempt her communion with the Beast, and utter devastation will ravage our people. But... the fact that {you} are here... a living descendant of our people... it gives me some hope for our future. I will come to your era. Perhaps there is still time.

#### The Ruins of Utzaal
Utzaal... my people... they're all long dead. It is one thing to hear it, but... another to see it. This city is nothing but a grave. I can't change their fate, but the Vaal are not entirely gone. Alva and her Vaal ancestry is proof of that. I will do what I must to protect what remains, and perhaps one day we can rebuild. For that to happen, we need the Weapon. We must travel to the archipelago the Karui call Ngamakanui. If the pieces still exist, that is where they will be found.
![[Doryani - The Ruins of Utzaal - 1.ogg]]
![[Doryani - The Ruins of Utzaal - 2.ogg]]
![[Doryani - The Ruins of Utzaal - 3.ogg]]

#### Utzaal
I gathered the greatest minds of our era in one place. We embarked on journeys of discovery that mankind could never before conceive. No ethical bounds. No moral limits! We sought immortality, both in flesh, and in machinery. We sought understanding of Corruption. We even sought to master Time itself. In the end, it was all for naught...
![[Doryani - Utzaal - 1.ogg]]
![[Doryani - Utzaal - 2.ogg]]

#### The Beast
Study of the Beast was my life's work, and the work of many Vaal scientists before me. Despite its danger, I still consider it a thing of beauty. A work of genius. It is capable of changing something fundamental about the nature of our existence. The Beast showed us it {can be done.} Our experiments with life... with death... with machinery, and augmentation... they were all inspired by it. We {can} surpass the impossible, if only we are willing to sacrifice enough.
![[Doryani - The Beast - 1.ogg]]
![[Doryani - The Beast - 2.ogg]]

#### DoryaniCataclysmFirstTalk
Now then it is time we departed. Activate the portal, and we will see about the-

#### DoryaniGodVoiceStopIntruderMale
The intruder is {here?} What of Napuatzi...? I see. No mercy then! Kill him on sight!
![[Doryani - DoryaniGodVoiceStopIntruderMale.ogg]]

#### DoryaniGodVoiceStopIntruderFemale
The intruder is {here?} What of Napuatzi...? I see. No mercy then! Kill her on sight!
![[Doryani - DoryaniGodVoiceStopIntruderFemale.ogg]]

#### DoryaniGodVoiceCeaseAssault
Fool! There's no time for this! Atziri will soon commune with the Beast! Cease your assault!
![[Doryani - DoryaniGodVoiceCeaseAssault.ogg]]

#### DoryaniGodVoiceStopAtOnce
Stop this at once! I take no pleasure in harming one of my own, but if you persist, I will do with her what I must.
![[Doryani - DoryaniGodVoiceStopAtOnce.ogg]]

#### DoryaniWildCataclysmBegins
It begins...

#### Shelter
So, you are mostly unscathed. That is good. Unfortunately, Wraeclast was not so lucky. It has been devastated by the Cataclysm and is no longer habitable. Grieving would only be a waste of precious time - we must face reality, and make difficult choices.
![[Doryani - Shelter - 1.ogg]]
![[Doryani - Shelter - 2.ogg]]

#### What now?
We {are} living the worst possible outcome, but I did anticipate {every} contingency... Before us is a translocation device, which {should} allow us to open portals to a wide range of coordinates across Wraeclast. With this, we can reclaim the world from the grasp of Corruption, so that civilisation can one day return to its former heights.
![[Doryani - What now? - 1.ogg]]
![[Doryani - What now? - 2.ogg]]
![[Doryani - What now? - 3.ogg]]

#### Our Work
There was some damage but while you were unconscious, we worked to repair the machine. I believe it will function as desired... But it must be tested. That is where you come in. By placing Waystones in the machine, they will help calibrate the journey. The Corruption at the destination will respond to both the energies we use, and that we ourselves expect to find. Let us use this malleability to our advantage... Let us see if the machine is still capable.
![[Doryani - Our Work - 1.ogg]]
![[Doryani - Our Work - 2.ogg]]
![[Doryani - Our Work - 3.ogg]]

#### [DNT] Seek Corrupted Biome
Wraeclast is wounded and broken. We must reshape its future, and heal it anew. The initial Cataclysmic event is over, but Corruption is still radiating from certain locations. From these points, it spreads like a disease. Travel to one of these regions and investigate. We must know why it is still spreading. Report back to me with your findings, and we will plan our next move.

![[Doryani - [DNT] Seek Corrupted Biome - 4.ogg]]
![[Doryani - [DNT] Seek Corrupted Biome - 5.ogg]]

#### [DNT] Find Corruption Nexus
So, these densely Corrupted regions contain an active source. Despite the risks, you must venture within. Find the source of Corruption. When you have identified it and dealt with any danger, call for me. I will cleanse what remains.
![[Doryani - [DNT] Find Corruption Nexus - 1.ogg]]
![[Doryani - [DNT] Find Corruption Nexus - 2.ogg]]
![[Doryani - [DNT] Find Corruption Nexus - 3.ogg]]

#### [DNT] See Tower
This is the first Precursor tower we've seen. You should take control of it, so that we may research its properties. There may be considerable foes in proximity... these towers channel forces we do not yet understand. If you see any sort of 'central tower' or nexus to the network, be sure to let me know...
![[Doryani - [DNT] See Tower - 1.ogg]]
![[Doryani - [DNT] See Tower - 2.ogg]]
![[Doryani - [DNT] See Tower - 3.ogg]]

#### [DNT] See Monolith (pinnacle)
There is a tremendous amount of energy radiating from that new structure. If it was Corruption, I would understand, but it's like nothing I have ever seen before. My intuition tells me that you must absolutely be the first to reach it. If it should fall into the hands of the Corrupted, there is no telling what may happen.
![[Doryani - [DNT] See Monolith (pinnacle) - 1.ogg]]
![[Doryani - [DNT] See Monolith (pinnacle) - 2.ogg]]
![[Doryani - [DNT] See Monolith (pinnacle) - 3.ogg]]

#### Cleanse Corruption
The device still functions, despite the damage the Cataclysm caused. Good. Now, using the device, you must seek out major sources of Corruption for us to cleanse.
![[Doryani - Cleanse Corruption - 1.ogg]]
![[Doryani - Cleanse Corruption - 2.ogg]]

#### DoryaniEndgameFirstMapFail
The device still functions, despite the damage the Cataclysm caused, but that is little solace if you are not up to the task. Gather your wits. There are far greater dangers to come. Using the device, you must seek out major sources of Corruption for us to cleanse.
![[Doryani - DoryaniEndgameFirstMapFail - 1.ogg]]
![[Doryani - DoryaniEndgameFirstMapFail - 2.ogg]]
![[Doryani - DoryaniEndgameFirstMapFail - 3.ogg]]

#### Cleanse Corruption_2
You have done well. That area has been cleansed, and the land may now return to its original state. By all means, continue.
![[Doryani - Cleanse Corruption_2.ogg]]

#### DoryaniEndgameFirstCorruptMapFail
You do know the fate of humanity rests upon your shoulders? Make whatever adjustments you require for success. Get back out there. Do better.
![[Doryani - DoryaniEndgameFirstCorruptMapFail.ogg]]

#### Modifying the Device
Using the cleansed Corruption you retrieved, I was able to modify the device to accommodate your request. You should find things somewhat different next time you venture out.
![[Doryani - Modifying the Device.ogg]]

#### Base of Operations
I believe it unwise to base our operations outside of the Ziggurat. This seems like an unnecessary risk to take. And Atalui is constantly complaining about the lack of facilities. However, I will make this concession, since you have done such critical work.
![[Doryani - Base of Operations - 1.ogg]]
![[Doryani - Base of Operations - 2.ogg]]

#### Precursor Beacon Activated
Ah, a Tower has been secured? Timely. While you were out, we discovered that an artefact from our archives might be related to its function. Take this Tablet. You should be able to use it at the Tower to transform the surrounding area.
![[Doryani - Precursor Beacon Activated - 1.ogg]]
![[Doryani - Precursor Beacon Activated - 2.ogg]]
![[Doryani - Precursor Beacon Activated - 3.ogg]]

#### Altered Landscape
The tower... the surrounding landscape has indeed been altered. This could be of great use to us. These towers are part of some long ago experiment on a grand scale...or perhaps, a {contingency...} I will do more research while you continue to explore.
![[Doryani - Altered Landscape - 1.ogg]]
![[Doryani - Altered Landscape - 2.ogg]]

#### Source of Corruption
The source of Corruption was a creature? I wish I could perform a detailed autopsy of its corpse, but its passive emanations alone would quickly kill us. It looks to be significantly more mutated than other beings we've encountered. I don't like having insufficient data on new threats... we are vulnerable until we know more.
![[Doryani - Source of Corruption - 1.ogg]]
![[Doryani - Source of Corruption - 2.ogg]]

#### Source of Corruption_2
This creature is far different from the type you defeated before. It looks to be the center of a hive mind. A legion of mutated creatures, without brains, acting as one. I never even considered such a thing possible, or we would have experimented with it at Aggorat... In any case, I will continue my dissections... There is something very disturbing about the arc of these mutations...
![[Doryani - Source of Corruption_2 - 1.ogg]]
![[Doryani - Source of Corruption_2 - 2.ogg]]
![[Doryani - Source of Corruption_2 - 3.ogg]]
![[Doryani - Source of Corruption_2 - 4.ogg]]

#### Source of Corruption_3
A third stratum of creatures, different yet again... I am starting to see a pattern here, one that bodes ill for us, but I cannot quite discern the meaning yet. Worse, these creatures appear to have been sentient. The mindless ravagers we first encountered could be outsmarted, and the hive-mind had an obvious weak point. But these ones can actually think. We are in grave danger...
![[Doryani - Source of Corruption_3 - 1.ogg]]
![[Doryani - Source of Corruption_3 - 2.ogg]]
![[Doryani - Source of Corruption_3 - 3.ogg]]
![[Doryani - Source of Corruption_3 - 4.ogg]]

#### Stabilisation
The current situation is finally stable. We have done enough to ensure humanity's survival, however meager our dignity may be. We should continue cleansing Corruption, however. It is true that we have ensured the future. Now, we should begin {improving} it.
![[Doryani - Stabilisation - 1.ogg]]
![[Doryani - Stabilisation - 2.ogg]]
![[Doryani - Stabilisation - 3.ogg]]

#### Cleansed Regions
Cleansed regions of Wraeclast are still dangerous, but only in the ways with which we are familiar. The demon you know, as they say. These regions should also contain substantial amounts of neutralised Corruption, which may manifest as orbs or crystals of anomalous material. Collect them if you see them. They may prove useful.
![[Doryani - Cleansed Regions - 1.ogg]]
![[Doryani - Cleansed Regions - 2.ogg]]
![[Doryani - Cleansed Regions - 3.ogg]]

#### Corruption
Corruption, at a fundamental level, is a form of energy. Much of Vaal technology was based on using that energy, because it is freely available in the environment... My piece of the Weapon cannot destroy that energy, only render it inert, in the form of crystalline precipitate. In that form, it cannot hurt us, and might even be put to new uses.
![[Doryani - Corruption - 1.ogg]]
![[Doryani - Corruption - 2.ogg]]
![[Doryani - Corruption - 3.ogg]]
![[Doryani - Corruption - 4.ogg]]

#### The Weapon
On its own, my piece of the Precursor Weapon can only neutralise {passive} Corruption. That is why you must destroy the {active} source in each deadly region first. If we were to... somehow... someday... find the other pieces, we would be able to directly drain Corruption from the most volatile of sources... even the Beast itself. If I'd had the Weapon in hand, I could have saved my people...
![[Doryani - The Weapon - 1.ogg]]
![[Doryani - The Weapon - 2.ogg]]
![[Doryani - The Weapon - 3.ogg]]

#### Fear
There is something... a secret horror that hides in the broken puzzle pieces we possess... a pattern that even my intellect cannot quite grasp. Not with such limited information. It may surprise you to discover that a man like me can feel fear. I admit it. Fear is healthy. I feel fear when I know I am in danger, but do not have enough information. It is impossible to act with precision unless we know, so I have always sought the truth...but in this instance, for the first time in my life, I fear {knowing,} too... and I don't yet know why...
![[Doryani - Fear - 1.ogg]]
![[Doryani - Fear - 2.ogg]]
![[Doryani - Fear - 3.ogg]]
![[Doryani - Fear - 4.ogg]]

#### DoryaniEndgameOnDream
Yes, that strange voice torments me in my sleep... so I more or less avoid sleeping. Thankfully, the light of our Inner Sun can remove the need for sleep, if you're willing to gaze directly into it for a time... Just don't do that for longer than a few days. It's not a perfect substitute.
![[Doryani - DoryaniEndgameOnDream - 1.ogg]]
![[Doryani - DoryaniEndgameOnDream - 2.ogg]]
![[Doryani - DoryaniEndgameOnDream - 3.ogg]]

#### DoryaniMapOnRealmgate
The Realmgate was the sister project to the Timegate that brought you to us. The Realmgate can, theoretically, give us access to other planes of existence. Unfortunately, it has never been activated, if it works at all. We need sizable energies or materials from those planes to help us locate them in the vast expanse of all that is. If you find otherworldly splinters and fragments, keep them. With enough of them, we can find out if the Realmgate truly works.
![[Doryani - DoryaniMapOnRealmgate - 1.ogg]]
![[Doryani - DoryaniMapOnRealmgate - 2.ogg]]
![[Doryani - DoryaniMapOnRealmgate - 3.ogg]]

#### DoryaniMapOnHideout
You have located a... {relatively safe} hideaway. We could establish a base of operations there, if you feel it necessary. We will always have the Ziggurat to fall back on, so the risk is not existential.
![[Doryani - DoryaniMapOnHideout - 1.ogg]]
![[Doryani - DoryaniMapOnHideout - 2.ogg]]
![[Doryani - DoryaniMapOnHideout - 3.ogg]]

#### DoryaniMapOnReliquary
The disciples of Kamasa stockpiled a great many things in their modern lust for wealth. The right key may open doors long forgotten...
![[Doryani - DoryaniMapOnReliquary.ogg]]

#### DoryaniMapOnZiggurat
The Ziggurat is the heart of our operations, the only truly safe place on Wraeclast. From here, we can reclaim the world for humanity.
![[Doryani - DoryaniMapOnZiggurat.ogg]]

#### The Burning Monolith
There is a tremendous amount of energy radiating from that new structure. If it was Corruption, I would understand, but it is like nothing I have ever seen before. My intuition tells me that you must absolutely be the first to reach it. If it should fall into the hands of the Corrupted, there is no telling what may happen.
![[Doryani - The Burning Monolith - 1.ogg]]
![[Doryani - The Burning Monolith - 2.ogg]]

#### Guardian of the Flame Seed
From what you've told me, the guardian of the Flame Seed seems to have been purposely molded for his task. The Precursors created him, but he is not one of them. I can only theorise as to his purpose...
![[Doryani - Guardian of the Flame Seed.ogg]]

#### The Flame Seed
I understand that... something... stole the Flame Seed as your battle drew to a close. This is concerning. There is little we can do until we know more.
![[Doryani - The Flame Seed.ogg]]

#### Gaining a Foothold
You must start with the areas of least Corruption. They are still deadly, but should be survivable for short spans. Cleanse enough of them to give us an outside foothold.
![[Doryani - Gaining a Foothold.ogg]]

#### Cleanse Corruption_3
Keep up your work. It is a long and dangerous task, but there is an end in sight.
![[Doryani - Cleanse Corruption_3.ogg]]

#### Cleanse Corruption_4
Continue clearing Corruption. It is the only thing we can do right now.
![[Doryani - Cleanse Corruption_4.ogg]]

#### Cleanse Corruption_5
Why are you wasting time here? Continue clearing Corruption!
![[Doryani - Cleanse Corruption_5.ogg]]

#### Cleanse Corruption_6
You don't look sick or injured. Why are you lingering here? Continue your work.
![[Doryani - Cleanse Corruption_6.ogg]]

#### Corruption Cleansing
The space you cleared allowed us to reclaim several important tools. We can now upgrade our machine.
![[Doryani - Corruption Cleansing.ogg]]

#### Corruption Cleansing_2
We found a handful of survivors in the area you cleared. We'll put them to work.
![[Doryani - Corruption Cleansing_2.ogg]]

#### Corruption Cleansing_3
A renowned scientist was... recovered... from the area you cleared. His acumen will add to our own.
![[Doryani - Corruption Cleansing_3.ogg]]

#### Corruption Cleansing_4
Valuable resources were located in the area you cleared. We can augment our capabilities.
![[Doryani - Corruption Cleansing_4.ogg]]

#### Corruption Cleansing_5
I have had time to increase the capabilities of the machine. We have a few choices to make.
![[Doryani - Corruption Cleansing_5.ogg]]

#### Corruption Cleansing_6
With each success, we grow closer to our goal.
![[Doryani - Corruption Cleansing_6.ogg]]

#### DoryaniEndgameTier15TaskComplete
The current situation is finally stable. We have done enough to ensure humanity's survival, however meager their dignity may be. This is not a victory, but it is a success. You may continue to cleanse Corruption as you wish. I will begin work on greater plans...
![[Doryani - DoryaniEndgameTier15TaskComplete - 1.ogg]]
![[Doryani - DoryaniEndgameTier15TaskComplete - 2.ogg]]

#### Cult of the Purple Flame
I had a suspicion that the Cult of the Purple Flame was dangerous. They did not know the true nature of the forces they beseeched. I'm not certain anyone will ever know the breadth of what lies beyond this world... but Chayula alone kept his word, in what little dealings were had. Perhaps one day, we will find out what happened to create this... Xesht.
![[Doryani - Cult of the Purple Flame - 1.ogg]]
![[Doryani - Cult of the Purple Flame - 2.ogg]]
![[Doryani - Cult of the Purple Flame - 3.ogg]]

#### The Weapon_2
I have invested considerable resources and many years of effort in the search, but my knowledge of the Precursors still remains scarce. They are as ancient to us as we are to you. On such time scales, geological events tend to obscure remnants of civilisation. There is evidence of great fires. Eruptions. Impacts from the sky. All I know is that they, too, delved into the secrets of this world. Corruption was just one of many forms of energy that they mastered. I have come across simple pictographs in their ruins, intended as a contingency, should others come without knowledge of their language. Most pictographs were quite clear: {'Death lies within.'} One, however, held faded instructions for what we should do if that death should ever escape; if it should ever plague the land. That is how I know the Weapon exists, and... generally... how to find it. Someone in the past wanted us to know about it, in case the worst should ever happen... and clearly, it has...
![[Doryani - The Weapon_2 - 1.ogg]]
![[Doryani - The Weapon_2 - 2.ogg]]
![[Doryani - The Weapon_2 - 3.ogg]]

#### Corrupted Wastelands
Out in the Corrupted wastelands, you will no doubt encounter 'survivors.' Do not fall victim to the trap of empathy. Though their bodies do not yet know it, they are {dead.} They sicken and taint everything they touch. They would slowly kill us by their very presence. They have no future. It would have been a mercy for them to die in the initial devastation. They will slowly waste away, and in their wasting, they will become disoriented... and then, enraged. They will seek to survive as long as possible, even if that means they doom the rest of us. They will be drawn to resources, and to power. {You} cannot allow them to possess that which we need. If you see them, kill them, and do not hesitate for even a moment.
![[Doryani - Corrupted Wastelands - 1.ogg]]
![[Doryani - Corrupted Wastelands - 2.ogg]]

#### Understanding the Wastelands
In the wake of the Cataclysm, reality is not what it used to be. There are far fewer of us now, and the mad outnumber the sane. You will see things out there that you will not understand. As much as I despise this truth as a man of science, it is quite possible they cannot {be} understood. Carry on with what must be done, and eventually, Wraeclast will... calm.
![[Doryani - Understanding the Wastelands - 1.ogg]]
![[Doryani - Understanding the Wastelands - 2.ogg]]

#### Tainted Survivors
As I predicted, the Corrupted 'survivors' out in the wastelands have banded together like primal animals. They refuse to accept their own doom. You must become proactive in your approach. Their warlords are perverse figments of reality that the Cataclysm has distorted. Find these tainted realities and cut the head off the snake, so to speak.
![[Doryani - Tainted Survivors - 1.ogg]]
![[Doryani - Tainted Survivors - 2.ogg]]

#### A Word of Warning
I should warn you... in my search for ways to stop the Cataclysm, I entreated the ultimate wisdom in this world, and I paid a terrible price. That price is out there, still and he is even more cunning and dangerous than I am, for he does not have my purity of purpose. When you meet him, destroy him utterly, and do not trouble yourself with your usual moral quandaries.
![[Doryani - A Word of Warning - 1.ogg]]
![[Doryani - A Word of Warning - 2.ogg]]

#### Precursor Towers
The sheer force of the Cataclysm scoured away much of the surface, and disrupted what remained. Sturdier than most, ancient Precursor towers have been left exposed. You should find one, and secure it for our research.
![[Doryani - Precursor Towers.ogg]]

#### Precursor Tower Network
I believe that the Precursor towers are part of a network created specifically to alter terrain and biomes. This may have been to make Wraeclast more habitable initially... or perhaps it had a larger purpose, later in their era. These ideas are just conjecture, of course.
![[Doryani - Precursor Tower Network - 1.ogg]]
![[Doryani - Precursor Tower Network - 2.ogg]]

#### Precursor Tablets
Now that you have secured a Precursor tower, it has quickly become clear that it requires some sort of tablet to activate. Find a Precursor tablet, and let us take a calculated risk by activating that tower.
![[Doryani - Precursor Tablets - 1.ogg]]
![[Doryani - Precursor Tablets - 2.ogg]]

#### DoryaniEndgameOnActivatingFirstTower
The tower... the surrounding landscape has been altered! This could be of great use to us. These towers are part of some long ago experiment, perhaps... or a contingency... I will do more research while you continue to explore.
![[Doryani - DoryaniEndgameOnActivatingFirstTower.ogg]]

#### Cataclysm's Corruption
In a time of minimal sentience and most of it mad what you encounter out there can be quite malleable. What we expect to find can shape things. The energies we use in our translocation device can influence outcomes. That device was made possible, after all, by a very special patron. They are likely watching us even now, and finding great humour in our travails...
![[Doryani - Cataclysm's Corruption - 1.ogg]]
![[Doryani - Cataclysm's Corruption - 2.ogg]]

#### Patron
I was told many cryptic things. I was asked to no, I shouldn't say. I don't understand, at least not yet. I was told this was the only way, yet still, I fought to find another path. I believe we make our own fates, but... here we are. If only I had the full picture...
![[Doryani - Patron - 1.ogg]]
![[Doryani - Patron - 2.ogg]]

#### DoryaniBossConversationOne
You're of Vaal descent, but I do not recognise your features, or your clothing. How can things have changed so much after only ten years?

#### DoryaniBossConversationTwo
What?! How long has it been?

#### DoryaniBossConversationThree
Unbelievable!... The Cataclysm... How many of us survived?

#### DoryaniBossConversationFour
That cannot be true. It can't! I've laid so many plans... Spent everything I have, trying to stop this... trying to stop Atziri...

#### DoryaniBossConversationFive
Perhaps... I just need a moment to think... To make a new plan... There must be a way...

#### DoryaniBossConversationSix
The intruder! Where is Napuatzi?! Ah... then I'll have to handle you myself.

So... at the eve of the end, the demon of Atzoatl has finally come for me!
