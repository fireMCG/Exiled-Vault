## Maramoa Dialogue
#### Clarissa
I've no time for babysitting. Our youngest, Clarissa, went out into the city to forage for supplies with her fool of a boyfriend, Tolman. They're overdue. You want to stay? Lend us a hand in the search. Find Clarissa and Tolman before the Blackguards do.
![[Maramoa - Clarissa.ogg]]

#### Clarissa_2
It is good to see you, son of the Ngakuramakoi. There are days when I've questioned the Ancestors. Why bring me here, to Wraeclast, so far from all that I love? Seeing you vindicates their decision. It is easy to be Karui when you are surrounded by Karui, but to walk the Karui Way through the kingdom of Kitava, that is the true test of a warrior. And as is our fate, our calling demands our sweat and our blood, every moment of every day. Our youngest, Clarissa, went into the city to forage for supplies with her fool of a boyfriend, Tolman. They're overdue. Help me, cousin. Help me find Clarissa and Tolman before the Blackguards do.
![[Maramoa - Clarissa_2.ogg]]

#### Clarissa_3
You have the walk, the grace, of a woman who knows Death intimately. Men are born with that knowledge. We have to earn it. Yes, there's much that you and I might speak of but we have not the time now. Our youngest, Clarissa, went into the city to forage for supplies with her fool of a boyfriend, Tolman. They're overdue. Will you help me, Ranger? Can you find Clarissa and Tolman before the Blackguards do?
![[Maramoa - Clarissa_3.ogg]]

#### The Ebony Legion
Dominus and his Ebony Legion arrived some time ago. Now the Blackguards scour Sarn like hungry maggots on a carcass. What're they looking for? Only that which is best left unfound.
![[Maramoa - The Ebony Legion.ogg]]

#### Tolman
Tolman's dead then. Another victim of Piety's cruelty. Perhaps he escaped lightly. Look upon Grigor to see what life entails under Piety's influence. And there was no sign of Clarissa? Then she's either avoided capture or the Blackguards are keeping her for some other purpose. Either way, a shard of sunlight graces her survival. Find her, before that light wanes.
![[Maramoa - Tolman.ogg]]

#### Clarissa_4
Maramoa Patua thanks you, exile, for returning our Clarissa to us. She is the gentle heart of this place, a spirit still capable of love in this wasteland of hatred. Yet that gentle heart remains in jeopardy. Tolman isn't deserving of Clarissa, but she'll not smile until he's by her side.
![[Maramoa - Clarissa_4.ogg]]

#### Clarissa_5
Maramoa Patua thanks you, son of the Ngakuramakoi, for returning our Clarissa to us. She is the gentle heart of this place, a spirit still capable of love in this wasteland of hatred. Yet that gentle heart remains in jeopardy. Tolman isn't deserving of Clarissa, but she'll not smile until he's by her side. There are days when I've questioned the Ancestors. Why bring me here, to Wraeclast, so far from all that I love? Seeing you vindicates their decision. It is easy to be Karui when you are surrounded by Karui, but to walk the Karui Way through this accursed land, that is the true test of a warrior. And as is our fate, our calling demands our sweat and our blood, every moment of every day. Help us, cousin. Help us by finding Tolman.
![[Maramoa - Clarissa_5.ogg]]

#### Clarissa_6
Maramoa Patua thanks you for returning our Clarissa to us. She is the gentle heart of this place, a spirit still capable of love in this wasteland of hatred. Yet that gentle heart remains in jeopardy. Tolman isn't deserving of Clarissa, but she'll not smile until he's by her side. You have the walk, the grace, of a woman who knows Death intimately. Men are born with that knowledge. We have to earn it. So from one woman to another, I ask for your help, Ranger. Please, find Tolman for us.
![[Maramoa - Clarissa_6.ogg]]

#### Clarissa_7
Tolman's dead then. Another victim of Piety's cruelty. Perhaps he escaped lightly. Look upon Grigor to see what life entails under Piety's influence. I give you this, in recognition of all that you have done for us. We shall mourn Tolman's death as we shall treasure Clarissa's life.
![[Maramoa - Clarissa_7.ogg]]

#### Tolman_2
Clarissa will weep for Tolman. She must. The cloud is darkest before the rain.
![[Maramoa - Tolman_2.ogg]]

#### Hargan
Hargan is a man of many claims, and those claims seldom dance harmoniously together. A lie is a death sentence in Ngamakanui, so I was raised a daughter of Truth. Hargan is a son of self interest. He's no warrior nor spirit-singer; He's a {korangi}. I don't know the right word in Oriathan, but in Karui it means 'he who wins wars with false promises'.
![[Maramoa - Hargan.ogg]]

#### Grigor
Grigor straddles two worlds. One foot planted on this soil, one in the dirt of spirit and shadow. When you speak with him, be sure to know from which world his words arise.
![[Maramoa - Grigor.ogg]]

#### The Ribbon Spool
This Ribbon Spool device... why would the Blackguards want to protect it, on this side of the river too? What is its import to them? And why have they not taken it back to their encampment? I give you only questions, I know. You found it near the Solaris Temple? Then perhaps that's where you should look for your answers.
![[Maramoa - The Ribbon Spool.ogg]]

#### The Purity Rebellion
It's an often-told story among the Karui. How Voll of Thebrus bent his knee to my ancestor, King Kaom, and promised freedom in return for war. While Voll raised his Purity Rebellion in the heart of the Empire, Kaom took Lord Lioneye's head and the southern coast all the way to the Siren's Cove. It was the greatest conquest the Karui had ever seen.
![[Maramoa - The Purity Rebellion.ogg]]

#### General Gravicius
General Gravicius demands absolute obedience from his Blackguards... meaning he's surrounded himself with cowards and lackwits unable to lift a finger without orders. If you are able, traverse the river and murder Gravicius in his own barracks. You'll be ripping the very mind from the skulls of our enemies.
![[Maramoa - General Gravicius.ogg]]

#### General Gravicius_2
You are the true spirit of {makoru}, the shark. Not the cowardly beast that sinks its teeth into the lonely swimmer. You strike the {waikoama}, the canoe, spilling a feast of men into the water. Hunters turned hunted that you dine on at your pleasure. Have this, Makoru.
![[Maramoa - General Gravicius_2.ogg]]

#### General Gravicius_3
You are the true spirit of {makoru}, the shark. Not the cowardly beast that sinks its teeth into the lonely swimmer. You strike the {waikoama}, the canoe, spilling a feast of men into the water. Hunters turned hunted that you dine on at your pleasure.
![[Maramoa - General Gravicius_3.ogg]]

#### The Undying
Citizens of Sarn that was... the Undying have been around for hundreds of years. Left to their own devices, they're likely to survive for hundreds more. Still, they're not immune to mortality's touch. They can be killed... with some difficulty.
![[Maramoa - The Undying.ogg]]

#### Crossing the River
If I knew how to cross the river safely, I'd be wearing Gravicius' head on my belt.
![[Maramoa - Crossing the River.ogg]]

#### Crossing the River_2
Traversing the sewers under the river. I should have thought of that myself. Yet, the more of a picture you paint of that Undying concoction in the sewers, the less I want to see it. If you manage to destroy it, expect a storm of undeath to descend upon you. The dark is their home, and there'd be nowhere more homely to the Undying than a pitch-swathed drain under a river.
![[Maramoa - Crossing the River_2.ogg]]

#### Crossing the River_3
You found a way to the other side. Good, but stand no closer, please. Sewer with a tinge of roasted undeath... it's a powerful fragrance. Be sure to stand downwind of Gravicius' tent when you reach the Barracks. You wouldn't want to lose the element of surprise.
![[Maramoa - Crossing the River_3.ogg]]

#### Piety
There's still prey out there. An over-reaching witch, floundering out of her depth. Happy hunting, Makoru.
![[Maramoa - Piety.ogg]]

#### Piety_2
You have claimed the most worthy of prey, Makoru. Piety, the Mistress of Corruption. I'm not saying the war is over, but you've given Wraeclast a much needed respite. Because of you, this land lives to see another dawn.
![[Maramoa - Piety_2.ogg]]

#### Piety_3
You have claimed the most worthy of prey, Makoru. Piety, the Mistress of Corruption. I'm not saying the war is over, but you've given Wraeclast a much needed respite. Because of you, this land lives to see another dawn. And don't forget that you've done Grigor a justice of some magnitude. He will wish to speak to you.
![[Maramoa - Piety_3.ogg]]

#### Piety_4
You have claimed the most worthy of prey, Makoru. Piety, the Mistress of Corruption. I'm not saying the war is over, but you've given Wraeclast a much needed respite. Because of you, this land lives to see another dawn. And don't forget that you've done Clarissa a justice of some magnitude. She will wish to speak to you.
![[Maramoa - Piety_4.ogg]]

#### Piety_5
You have claimed the most worthy of prey, Makoru. Piety, the Mistress of Corruption. I'm not saying the war is over, but you've given Wraeclast a much needed respite. Because of you, this land lives to see another dawn. And don't forget that you've done Grigor and Clarissa a justice of some magnitude. They will wish to speak to you.
![[Maramoa - Piety_5.ogg]]

#### Dominus
To kill a man like Dominus, that's an accomplishment worthy of Kaom, my greatest ancestor. Were we in Ngamakanui, I'd make you a {makanga}, an honoured warrior. But we are not in Ngamakanui. We dwell in a city of death, and my respect is all the honour I can bestow on you.
![[Maramoa - Dominus.ogg]]

#### Piety and Dominus
You have claimed the most worthy of prey, Makoru. Piety and Dominus, the Harbingers of Nightmare. I'm not saying the war is over, but you've given Wraeclast a much needed respite. Because of you, this land lives to see another dawn.
![[Maramoa - Piety and Dominus.ogg]]

#### Solaris and Lunaris
Good to see you in Sarn once again. I wish that we could be greeting under fairer skies, yet this city remains clouded in strife. Lunaris, Eternal goddess of the Moon and her sister, Solaris of the Sun, have risen to reclaim what was once their own. Siblings equal in strength, mighty twin rivers converging, sweeping all before them. We are cornered animals, awaiting the deluge that will surely drown us. Yet there exists a pair of ancient treasures, the Sun Orb and the Moon Orb. They are our hope... our desperation.
![[Maramoa - Solaris and Lunaris.ogg]]

#### The Sun Orb
These owl eyes of mine have been watching the sun goddess from afar. The Sun Orb lies within her temple, guarded by her most ardent devotee. An exile who, in his insanity, has taken to calling himself 'The Dawn'. That orb is the seed that must be stolen from this new son of hers, and planted at the feet of his ancient mother.
![[Maramoa - The Sun Orb.ogg]]

#### The Moon Orb
I've been keeping a close eye on that exile-turned-sycophant who calls himself, 'The Dusk'. Dusk carried the Moon Orb into the Lunaris Temple and has not returned with it, not as far as I have seen. No doubt he clings to that orb like it's his adopted mother's own nurturing breast. If you were to wean him from the teat, and place that orb at the bereft mother's feet, we may yet see the moon itself fall.
![[Maramoa - The Moon Orb.ogg]]

#### The Orbs of Sun and Moon
By the earth and sky, the power of the goddesses lies in your hands. Take these seeds and plant them in the fertile stone at their feet. From what I have learned, It is my hope that the orbs will force Solaris and Lunaris to grow limbs and flesh, to engage you in mortal battle. May this come to pass, and may you cut down these goddesses as a forester might fell a pair of stubborn old trees.
![[Maramoa - The Orbs of Sun and Moon.ogg]]

#### Solaris and Lunaris_2
You have offered us the greatest of gifts. Freedom. With these divine tyrants gone, we are free to live our lives as we wish, not as is ordained. In time, all of Sarn will thank you. For now, let it simply be me.
![[Maramoa - Solaris and Lunaris_2.ogg]]

#### Grigor_2
Grigor is the butterfly that has lost its wings to a cruel child, and this place of respite has become a cage for his pain, a breeding ground of bad memory. We spoke and Grigor shared his resolve with me. He can no longer live with the torment that Piety has injected into his heart. Like the warrior-poet he is, Grigor has ventured into the unknown, to find a cure for his body and mind, or die in the attempt.
![[Maramoa - Grigor_2.ogg]]

#### Clarissa and Tolman
The dead do not love the living and the living cannot love the dead. People fear what they do not understand. I understand Clarissa. I am not frightened of her. I am frightened for her.
![[Maramoa - Clarissa and Tolman.ogg]]

#### Clarissa and Tolman_2
If I am a watchful owl then you are the courageous hawk, swooping with sharpened talons to wrench the serpent from the child's neck. Clarissa will bear that wound for the rest of her life, but I am glad you were there to save her from following poor Tolman into the dirt. Perhaps now that Clarissa has lost her love of death, she will finally be able to embrace life.
![[Maramoa - Clarissa and Tolman_2.ogg]]

#### The Gemling Legion
I was out hunting food for our encampment. Like a prowling cat I was, but what I saw marching across the ruins made me feel like a little mouse. Gem-studded warriors pounding the earth, lead by their strongest... a Captain. I've known of these gemling legionnaires, how they were once the personal swords of Emperor Chitus. But now they rise again, with this Captain at their fore. Swallowing my fear, I followed the Captain and found a force being gathered within the Grain Gate. Exile, I know it's not fair for me to ask, you have done so many things for us, but if you were to find the Captain and slay him and his men, I would honour you greatly. Our little town would not survive an onslaught such as the Captain is likely to enact upon us.
![[Maramoa - The Gemling Legion.ogg]]

#### Gemling Legionnaires
They walked our earth in the times of great strife, cruel and hideous shadows, cast against the clay wall of ruined abode. Thaumaturge Malachai grew them out of the vain ambitions of his dark imaginings. Emperor Chitus believed the legionnaires belonged to him, that gemling men would beat to the drum of his own crystalline heart. But as the silhouette of the emperor faltered and fell, burned out by the light of true men, some of the legion remained. The cataclysm turned legionnaire into monster, another mindless man of undeath. Yet this Captain seems to have regained his faculties, some of his old warrior intelligence. I worry for the rest of his soldiers, how they may grow from mindless killing machines into something far worse.
![[Maramoa - Gemling Legionnaires.ogg]]

#### The Gemling Legion_2
My courageous hawk removes yet another snake from the long grass. I offer you a reward, but my mind remains unsettled. The Captain lies rotting in the ground, buzzing with flies, but if gemling legionnaires can regain their sentience, then can all of the monstrosities of the Undying do the same? My thoughts turn to the burrows and chambers beneath the earth of Sarn. Could there be some new undead civilisation growing and preparing itself underground at this very moment? Such thoughts do not make for easy sleeping.
![[Maramoa - The Gemling Legion_2.ogg]]
