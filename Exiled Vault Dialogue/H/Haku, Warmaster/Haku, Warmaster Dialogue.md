## Haku, Warmaster Dialogue
#### HakuPrimaryDefenderStartsFightZero
Tala moana, warrior! Flee if you do not wish to die.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuPrimaryDefenderStartsFightZero.ogg]]

#### HakuPrimaryDefenderStartsFightOne
Brave of you to attack a Karui in his fortress. Brave, and foolish.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuPrimaryDefenderStartsFightOne.ogg]]

#### HakuPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwo
Keep moving! I'll handle the exile.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwo.ogg]]

#### HakuPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThree
Exile, you've just walked into your tomb.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThree.ogg]]

#### HakuPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFour
Hinekora, I will send you a gift!
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFour.ogg]]

#### HakuPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFive
Did you think I would crumble in that prison? My ancestors spent centuries in shackles.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFive.ogg]]

#### HakuPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSix
I stayed true to my word, exile. Did you?
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSix.ogg]]

#### HakuPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSeven
My ancestors will forgive my transgressions. Will yours?
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSeven.ogg]]

#### HakuPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEight
The Mother of Death did not return me empty-handed.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEight.ogg]]

#### HakuPrimaryDefenderStartsFightNine
Back from the dead? You are nothing but a child of Kitava.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuPrimaryDefenderStartsFightNine.ogg]]

#### HakuPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTen
I will crush you.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTen.ogg]]

#### HakuPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEleven
A true warrior need only hit you once.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEleven.ogg]]

#### HakuPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwelve
Nothing can stop a true Karui warrior.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwelve.ogg]]

#### HakuPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThirteen
We Karui were born in a volcano.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThirteen.ogg]]

#### HakuPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFourteen
You have no concept of what you truly face.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFourteen.ogg]]

#### HakuSafehouseLeaderIntroZero
I will hang your head on my belt, as Kaom did Lioneye's.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuSafehouseLeaderIntroZero.ogg]]

#### HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero
We will push the invader back together!
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero.ogg]]

#### HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne
We cannot lose this cargo!
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne.ogg]]

#### HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo
Strength in numbers, friend!
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo.ogg]]

#### HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree
The Ancestors forgive. The Syndicate does not.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree.ogg]]

#### HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour
I lend you my strength, ally.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour.ogg]]

#### HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive
The Syndicate fights as one!
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive.ogg]]

#### HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix
Stop wasting time, Leo. We have more important tasks.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix.ogg]]

#### HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven
Talamoana, holy man. Did your god not show up?
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven.ogg]]

#### HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight
Talamoana, son of stone.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight.ogg]]

#### HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine
Rin, let me show you how a Karui fights.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine.ogg]]

#### HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalTen
You put too much faith in your gadgetry, Riker.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalTen.ogg]]

#### HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalEleven
Ancestors, guide us to victory.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalEleven.ogg]]

#### HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwelve
I have come to claim what is mine.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwelve.ogg]]

#### HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirteen
Your failure will be my finest hour.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirteen.ogg]]

#### HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalFourteen
You will all be buried down here.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalFourteen.ogg]]

#### HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalFifteen
I will bring you all into Hinekora's domain.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalFifteen.ogg]]

#### HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalSixteen
Let's see if my attacks draw out that god of yours, holy man.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalSixteen.ogg]]

#### HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeventeen
I am sorry huntress, but we must be enemies this day.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeventeen.ogg]]

#### HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalEighteen
Exile, know that when that creature dies, it will not go to Hinekora. It will go nowhere at all.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalEighteen.ogg]]

#### HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalNineteen
Your spirit will be the plaything of the Ancestors, slavemaster.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalNineteen.ogg]]

#### HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwenty
You go too far, Aisling. Violence is a necessity, not an idle pastime.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwenty.ogg]]

#### HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyOne
Hinekora demands many sacrifices this day. Consider it an honour.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyOne.ogg]]

#### HakuReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero
Scoundrel! I will break you, too!
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero.ogg]]

#### HakuReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne
I am not yet dead, vulture!
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne.ogg]]

#### HakuReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo
You have just buried yourself.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo.ogg]]

#### HakuReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree
I will show you no mercy, traitor.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree.ogg]]

#### HakuReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour
I think my gods are stronger than yours, crusader.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour.ogg]]

#### HakuReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive
I won't need my ancestors' aid for this one, abomination.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive.ogg]]

#### HakuReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix
You will answer to the Ancestors, Gravicius - with screams.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix.ogg]]

#### HakuReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven
The dead belong to Hinekora, defiler. I will send you to her.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven.ogg]]

#### HakuReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight
So be it. Karui jade will cleave you just as easily as this exile.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight.ogg]]

#### HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyTwo
Steel yourself. For Tukohama!
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyTwo.ogg]]

#### HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyThree
Ancestors, witness this!
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyThree.ogg]]

#### HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFour
Feel the walls tremble with our combined might!
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFour.ogg]]

#### HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFive
Can you hear it, exile? Hinekora is calling your name.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFive.ogg]]

#### HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySix
Tora, I'd no sooner taunt a wolf than give you an order. Just remember: I'm the alpha.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySix.ogg]]

#### HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySeven
Assassin! Do not forget who is in charge.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySeven.ogg]]

#### HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyEight
I protect all my men, even ones that aren't.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyEight.ogg]]

#### HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyNine
A Karui in command over Gravicius. Hinekora is laughing.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyNine.ogg]]

#### HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirty
Direct your gadgetry as I command, Maloney, and those traps of yours might just accomplish something.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirty.ogg]]

#### HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirtyOne
To face a Karui's men is to face the Karui.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirtyOne.ogg]]

#### HakuKillPlayerZero
A worthy foe.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuKillPlayerZero.ogg]]

#### HakuKillPlayerOne
You will feed the worms.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuKillPlayerOne.ogg]]

#### HakuKillPlayerTwo
A glorious fight!
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuKillPlayerTwo.ogg]]

#### HakuKillPlayerThree
Mother of Death, a gift.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuKillPlayerThree.ogg]]

#### HakuEscapeZero
A warning. Do not cross me again.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuEscapeZero.ogg]]

#### HakuEscapeOne
A nesting bird gets no worms. So long, exile.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuEscapeOne.ogg]]

#### HakuEscapeTwo
You have not earned the Ancestors' favour. That is why you are destined to fail.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuEscapeTwo.ogg]]

#### HakuDefeatedZero
Tukohama... how did I fail?
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuDefeatedZero.ogg]]

#### HakuDefeatedOne
No... the cart must... ugh...
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuDefeatedOne.ogg]]

#### HakuDefeatedTwo
Ancestors... I - forgive me.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuDefeatedTwo.ogg]]

#### HakuDefeatedThree
Hinekora... I am sorry.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuDefeatedThree.ogg]]

#### HakuDefeatedFour
Don't... lock me up again...
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuDefeatedFour.ogg]]

#### HakuDefeatedFive
Ugh... exile... another deal...?
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuDefeatedFive.ogg]]

#### HakuDefeatedSix
I strayed too far... from the Way.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuDefeatedSix.ogg]]

#### HakuDefeatedSeven
Ancestors... I will see you again.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuDefeatedSeven.ogg]]

#### HakuDefeatedEight
You... have learned much...
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuDefeatedEight.ogg]]

#### HakuDefeatedNine
This was... a cursed task.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuDefeatedNine.ogg]]

#### HakuDefeatedTen
I was a fool... to follow my fury.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuDefeatedTen.ogg]]

#### HakuOfferBargainZero
I do not wish to join my ancestors just yet, exile. In Ngamakanui, our treaties mandated that an offering of peace be witnessed by a third. I wish for peace. Will you choose our witness?
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuOfferBargainZero.ogg]]

#### HakuOfferBargainOne
Enough blood has been shed today, warrior. Put down your weapon, and I will offer you an opportunity. There is one in my new tribe I would deceive. Give me a reason to, and I will tell you that which I know about them.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuOfferBargainOne.ogg]]

#### HakuOfferBargainTwo
Conquerors don't just win fights, they put people in positions where it benefits them most. I think I would benefit you better elsewhere.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuOfferBargainTwo.ogg]]

#### HakuOfferBargainThree
I do not wish to be here any longer, exile. The Ancestors whisper in my ear. They tell me that I am needed back home in Ngamakanui. Have you the mercy to let a man return to his family?
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuOfferBargainThree.ogg]]

#### HakuOfferBargainFour
I know when I am defeated. Not every fight must end with death, nor should it. In my tribe, the victor claims their prize, and the slate is wiped clean. I will tell you what you want to know in exchange for my safety.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuOfferBargainFour.ogg]]

#### HakuOfferBargainFive
I know my histories. You conquerors are all the same. You seek only two things: my head, or my goods. So take one and leave the other.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuOfferBargainFive.ogg]]

#### HakuOfferBargainSix
I must confess, I believed you to be bluffing. I see now how little regard for life you truly have. Whatever it is you want, it's yours.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuOfferBargainSix.ogg]]

#### HakuBargainAcceptedZero
A wise choice indeed.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuBargainAcceptedZero.ogg]]

#### HakuBargainAcceptedOne
Then it is subterfuge.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuBargainAcceptedOne.ogg]]

#### HakuBargainAcceptedTwo
So be it. I will fulfill my duties there.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuBargainAcceptedTwo.ogg]]

#### HakuBargainAcceptedThree
It will be good to see my family again.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuBargainAcceptedThree.ogg]]

#### HakuBargainAcceptedFour
Consider us even.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuBargainAcceptedFour.ogg]]

#### HakuBargainAcceptedFive
Take your prize and go.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuBargainAcceptedFive.ogg]]

#### HakuOfferBetrayalZero
It is the Karui way to give leadership to the victor. In this situation, I believe that means that you could choose a new leader in place of the old one. If you choose me, I will honour that choice.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuOfferBetrayalZero.ogg]]

#### HakuOfferBetrayalOne
Among the Karui, conflict often results in changes in rank and respect. In this situation, I believe that means you could demote some and promote others. If you choose me, I will honour that choice.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuOfferBetrayalOne.ogg]]

#### HakuOfferBetrayalTwo
The Syndicate does not follow the Karui Way, but I do, and a victory like yours gives you a choice over our fates. If you so choose, you could have one of us exiled from the Syndicate entirely. If you make that choice here and now, I will make sure they honour it.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuOfferBetrayalTwo.ogg]]

#### HakuOfferBetrayalThree
A victory like yours demands a prize. I have nothing to give except information - not typically considered a prize by the Karui, but, in this situation, I believe information is your most valuable weapon against the Syndicate.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuOfferBetrayalThree.ogg]]

#### HakuOfferBetrayalFour
There is a fine line between belief and madness. I believe Elreon is long past it.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuOfferBetrayalFour.ogg]]

#### HakuOfferBetrayalFive
The huntress has lost her path. Let's help her find it together.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuOfferBetrayalFive.ogg]]

#### HakuOfferBetrayalSix
I bear no kinship with that... thing. It is not of this world and is entirely without honour.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuOfferBetrayalSix.ogg]]

#### HakuOfferBetrayalSeven
Our conflict aside, exile, Gravicius must be made to answer for his atrocities. You'll find no better chance than this to provide the Ancestors a sliver of justice.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuOfferBetrayalSeven.ogg]]

#### HakuOfferBetrayalEight
Aisling is a monster hidden in a pleasing form. You must hear me.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuOfferBetrayalEight.ogg]]

#### HakuOfferBetrayalNine
The Karui Way is sometimes bitingly cold, but it is still the Way.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuOfferBetrayalNine.ogg]]

#### HakuOfferExecuteZero
I choose an honourable death.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuOfferExecuteZero.ogg]]

#### HakuOfferExecuteOne
I am honoured to die for my cause.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuOfferExecuteOne.ogg]]

#### HakuOfferExecuteTwo
I would sooner die than betray my friends.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuOfferExecuteTwo.ogg]]

#### HakuOfferExecuteThree
I seek only the darkness that death brings. Not the inside of a cell.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuOfferExecuteThree.ogg]]

#### HakuReplyToBetrayalAcceptedZero
The Ancestors will remember your actions!
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuReplyToBetrayalAcceptedZero.ogg]]

#### HakuReplyToBetrayalAcceptedOne
My 'trees and ghosts' will be waiting for you after death, old man.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuReplyToBetrayalAcceptedOne.ogg]]

#### HakuReplyToBetrayalAcceptedTwo
I don't need your gentle arrow in my back, huntress.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuReplyToBetrayalAcceptedTwo.ogg]]

#### HakuReplyToBetrayalAcceptedThree
I always expect the worst from you, Janus, and you always over-deliver.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuReplyToBetrayalAcceptedThree.ogg]]

#### HakuReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFour
And I will have no qualms cutting your head from your shoulders for this, slavemaster.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFour.ogg]]

#### HakuReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFive
How noble of you, vile Redblade.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFive.ogg]]

#### HakuReplyToBetrayalAcceptedSix
This Syndicate makes traitors of us all.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuReplyToBetrayalAcceptedSix.ogg]]

#### HakuInterrogatedZero
You dishonour me. Imprisonment is for slaves, not warriors!
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuInterrogatedZero.ogg]]

#### HakuInterrogatedOne
I cannot abide this continual dishonour, exile! You spit in my face...
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuInterrogatedOne.ogg]]

#### HakuInterrogatedTwo
Ancestors, give me strength to withstand the shame and dishonour this exile casts upon me.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuInterrogatedTwo.ogg]]

#### HakuReplyToExecutionZero
You honour the Way by swiftly delivering death to warriors who fought well.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuReplyToExecutionZero.ogg]]

#### HakuReplyToExecutionOne
You show honour by delivering clean deaths.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuReplyToExecutionOne.ogg]]

#### HakuReplyToExecutionTwo
That one did not deserve an honourable death.
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuReplyToExecutionTwo.ogg]]

#### HakuSafehouseLeaderDefeatedZero
Ancestors, have you forsaken me?
![[Haku, Warmaster - HakuSafehouseLeaderDefeatedZero.ogg]]
