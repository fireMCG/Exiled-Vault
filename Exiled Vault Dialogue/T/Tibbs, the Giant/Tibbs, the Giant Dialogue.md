#### IntroductionTullinaTibbsToExile
I've brought an old mate of mine along for this job. Her name's Tullina.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - IntroductionTullinaTibbsToExile.ogg]]

#### IntroductionTullinaTibbsToExileTwo
She might not look like much--
![[Tibbs, the Giant - IntroductionTullinaTibbsToExileTwo.ogg]]

#### IntroductionTullinaTibbsToExileThree
--but she can get into places no one else can.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - IntroductionTullinaTibbsToExileThree.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterTullinaTibbsReply
Not sure I could be a much bigger target...
![[Tibbs, the Giant - EntryBanterTullinaTibbsReply.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterTibbsToTullina
Nerves are gettin' to me again.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - EntryBanterTibbsToTullina.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterTullinaTibbsReply
Agreed. I've seen how bad it can get.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - ExitBanterTullinaTibbsReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterTullinaTibbsReplyTwo
The burning pond.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - ExitBanterTullinaTibbsReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterTibbsToTullina
A near-unbelievable success!
![[Tibbs, the Giant - ExitBanterTibbsToTullina.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTullinaTibbsReply
Easier than the Belltower gig.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - SelectionBanterTullinaTibbsReply.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTullinaTibbsReplyTwo
Everything's just a bit higher up for me than most people.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - SelectionBanterTullinaTibbsReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTullinaTibbsReplyThree
All the eyes and legs! Who needs that many?
![[Tibbs, the Giant - SelectionBanterTullinaTibbsReplyThree.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTullinaTibbsReplyFour
What're you supposed to do when a ghost attacks! Kill 'em? They're already bloody dead!
![[Tibbs, the Giant - SelectionBanterTullinaTibbsReplyFour.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTibbsToTullina
I'm packed and ready.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - SelectionBanterTibbsToTullina.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTibbsToTullinaTwo
Well, maybe not always, eh?
![[Tibbs, the Giant - SelectionBanterTibbsToTullinaTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTibbsToTullinaThree
I still have those nightmares. I wake up feeling like I'm covered in spiders.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - SelectionBanterTibbsToTullinaThree.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTibbsToTullinaFour
...Ehh... Thanks, I guess.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - SelectionBanterTibbsToTullinaFour.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterTibbsToAdiyah
I am absolutely bloody exhausted.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - ExitBanterTibbsToAdiyah.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterTibbsToAdiyahTwo
With bubbles?
![[Tibbs, the Giant - ExitBanterTibbsToAdiyahTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterAdiyahTibbsReply
Huge success!

#### Introduction
Round here, people call me Tibbs. Not the quietest little sneak, and I'm not exactly nimble with these big sausage fingers, but if you find yourself on the wrong side of something heavy, you'll wish you thought to hire me.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - Introduction.ogg]]

#### The Boss
Heard the Boss got his start as a stable boy in the Grand Arena. Used to feed and care for the chariot horses. That was his first job, and it led to his first ... err, 'job'. Apparently, someone asked him to slip something into the feed of the Octavius family's finest stallion, greatly favoured to win the race. Paid him a week's worth of his normal wages. Boss figured it was some sort of poison. So he watched the man place a bet, and poisoned that horse as well. Neither died, but neither won, and the Boss, betting his wages on a horse he knew to be fit as a gladiator, took home a killing. 'Course, that was also his last day of gainful employment at the arena. The man stalked those stables for months trying to find him.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - The Boss.ogg]]

#### Finding Opal
Ah, my contract! A man of my build gets a lot of attention. By the time I was thirteen, I was taller than most adults. By my next birthday I was invited to join a little circus of sorts as the strongman. That's where I met Tullina, by the way. One day, someone left a baby girl, named Opal, for the troupe leader. She had bright red eyes, but the most pale skin and whitest hair I'd ever seen. She became a sort of daughter of the whole troupe. We took turns looking after her. By the time she was about seven, I'd grown quite attached to her, and she to me. The hardest part of being exiled is not knowing what has happened to her. So I want to find out. I know the troupe is disbanded, so I just want to make sure she's found a good home.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - Finding Opal.ogg]]

#### Finding Opal_2
Well, it ain't great news. Templar took an interest in her because of her unique traits, but she dropped off the map before they could get her. Good instincts. I have a hunch that she might've found some of the old troupe members. I'll see what Whakano can dig up.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - Finding Opal_2.ogg]]

#### Opal's Jewels
Got an update on Opal! She's living on the fringes with some of the old troupe, like I thought. Tough people to track down, but at least I know she's safe. I want to keep it that way. I want to make sure she doesn't need to put herself at risk to work or eat, so we're going to do what is, essentially, the opposite of a bank robbery. We're breaking in to leave enough wealth for her to live safely out of harm's way in a vault under a pseudonym.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - Opal's Jewels.ogg]]

#### Opal's Jewels_2
I know I'm a lot poorer than I was a few days ago, but I feel like I've done some real good. Opal's a smart kid. She'll put that money to good use. Better than I would've anyway. Thanks, Exile. Really.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - Opal's Jewels_2.ogg]]

#### TibbsSelectedContractOne
Just don't ask me to help you move.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - TibbsSelectedContractOne.ogg]]

#### TibbsSelectedContractTwo
As long as you're paying.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - TibbsSelectedContractTwo.ogg]]

You need muscle?
![[Tibbs, the Giant - TibbsSelectedBlueprintOne.ogg]]

#### TibbsDemolitionThree
Looks fragile enough...
![[Tibbs, the Giant - TibbsDemolitionThree.ogg]]

#### TibbsDemolitionFour
If it ain't broke, it will be...
![[Tibbs, the Giant - TibbsDemolitionFour.ogg]]

#### TibbsDemolitionFive
This one might take a bit, but we'll get there.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - TibbsDemolitionFive.ogg]]

#### TibbsDemolitionSix
I think it'd look better in pieces too.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - TibbsDemolitionSix.ogg]]

#### TibbsBusyOne
One sec.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - TibbsBusyOne.ogg]]

#### TibbsBusyTwo
In the middle of something here.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - TibbsBusyTwo.ogg]]

Can it wait?
![[Tibbs, the Giant - TibbsBusyThree.ogg]]

#### TibbsBusyFour
Mate, I'm busy.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - TibbsBusyFour.ogg]]

#### TibbsInterruptedOne
Ugh! Little help here?

Oi, I'm getting hit!

#### TibbsInterruptedThree
Get the bastards off me!
![[Tibbs, the Giant - TibbsInterruptedThree.ogg]]

#### TibbsInterruptedFour
Damn. Help!
![[Tibbs, the Giant - TibbsInterruptedFour.ogg]]

#### TibbsCombatStartOne
Should've ignored the noise, mate.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - TibbsCombatStartOne.ogg]]

#### TibbsCombatStartTwo
You ain't gonna like this.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - TibbsCombatStartTwo.ogg]]

#### TibbsCombatStartThree
Heads up, we got trouble!
![[Tibbs, the Giant - TibbsCombatStartThree.ogg]]

#### TibbsCombatStartFour
Hate this part of the job.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - TibbsCombatStartFour.ogg]]

#### TibbsCombatStartFive
You're gonna be sorry. Then I'm gonna be sorry.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - TibbsCombatStartFive.ogg]]

#### TibssCombatEndOne
Right, well, carry on I guess.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - TibssCombatEndOne.ogg]]

#### TibssCombatEndTwo
Good stuff.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - TibssCombatEndTwo.ogg]]

#### TibssCombatEndThree
Least we ain't cleaning up.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - TibssCombatEndThree.ogg]]

#### TibssCombatEndFour
Keep it quick and quiet.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - TibssCombatEndFour.ogg]]

#### TibssCombatEndFive
...Sorry.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - TibssCombatEndFive.ogg]]

#### TibbsLootingOne
Not too shabby, mate.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - TibbsLootingOne.ogg]]

#### TibbsLootingTwo
Nice piece.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - TibbsLootingTwo.ogg]]

#### TibbsLootingThree
Now who just leaves something like that lying around?
![[Tibbs, the Giant - TibbsLootingThree.ogg]]

#### TibbsLootingFour
That is a keeper.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - TibbsLootingFour.ogg]]

#### TibbsLootingFive
Oh, know a girl who'd love that.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - TibbsLootingFive.ogg]]

#### TibbsAlertThresholdOne
We've gotta keep it down.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - TibbsAlertThresholdOne.ogg]]

#### TibbsAlertThresholdTwo
I'm gettin' a bad feeling, mate.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - TibbsAlertThresholdTwo.ogg]]

#### TibbsAlertThresholdThree
Reckon we're cutting it close now.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - TibbsAlertThresholdThree.ogg]]

#### TibbsAlertThresholdFour
Right, we gotta make tracks soon.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - TibbsAlertThresholdFour.ogg]]

#### TibbsAlarmOne
Time to leave!
![[Tibbs, the Giant - TibbsAlarmOne.ogg]]

#### TibbsAlarmTwo
Let's start making tracks.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - TibbsAlarmTwo.ogg]]

#### TibbsAlarmThree
There it is. Let's go!
![[Tibbs, the Giant - TibbsAlarmThree.ogg]]

#### TibbsEarlyAlarmOne
Woah, mate, we gotta move!
![[Tibbs, the Giant - TibbsEarlyAlarmOne.ogg]]

#### TibbsEarlyAlarmTwo
Hear that?! Let's head out!
![[Tibbs, the Giant - TibbsEarlyAlarmTwo.ogg]]

#### TibbsEarlyAlarmThree
Now you've gone and done it.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - TibbsEarlyAlarmThree.ogg]]

#### TibbsFinalRoomOne
Think this might be what we're after.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - TibbsFinalRoomOne.ogg]]

#### TibbsFinalRoomTwo
Ah, here it is.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - TibbsFinalRoomTwo.ogg]]

#### TibbsObjectiveLootedFour
Now for the hard part.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - TibbsObjectiveLootedFour.ogg]]

#### TibbsEntryBanterOne
Always get butterflies before a job...
![[Tibbs, the Giant - TibbsEntryBanterOne.ogg]]

#### TibbsEntryBanterTwo
Whew, I'm sweating. Just nerves. Just harmless nerves.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - TibbsEntryBanterTwo.ogg]]

#### TibbsEntryBanterThree
I always think this time I won't get nervous, and I always do.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - TibbsEntryBanterThree.ogg]]

#### TibbsEntryBanterFour
Come on, Gil. You've got this. Easy as. Eeeaaasy as.

#### TibbsCombatEndLoudThree
We had to, right!?
![[Tibbs, the Giant - TibbsCombatEndLoudThree.ogg]]

#### TibbsCombatEndLoudFour
Should've just let us leave.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - TibbsCombatEndLoudFour.ogg]]

#### TibbsCombatEndLoudFive
Doesn't get any easier.

Remember the target. Don't get too sidetracked.

#### EntryBanterKarstTibbsReply
Thanks for the... heads up! ... Nothing?
![[Tibbs, the Giant - EntryBanterKarstTibbsReply.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterIslaTibbsReply
Uhh... Yes.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - EntryBanterIslaTibbsReply.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterIslaTibbsReplyTwo
I guess it does!
![[Tibbs, the Giant - EntryBanterIslaTibbsReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterVinderiTibbsReply
... But...?
![[Tibbs, the Giant - EntryBanterVinderiTibbsReply.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterNenetTibbsReply
Not the sort of thing I like hearing before a job.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - EntryBanterNenetTibbsReply.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterNilesTibbsReply
Maybe you shouldn't be snooping around in there.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - EntryBanterNilesTibbsReply.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterHuckTibbsReply
... Hungry?--
![[Tibbs, the Giant - EntryBanterHuckTibbsReply.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterHuckTibbsReplyTwo
Close.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - EntryBanterHuckTibbsReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterGiannaTibbsReply
Ehh... Sorry Gianna. Maybe practice that one more.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - EntryBanterGiannaTibbsReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterTibbsToKarst
Can't believe we pulled that off. Even Karst did good!
![[Tibbs, the Giant - ExitBanterTibbsToKarst.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterTibbsToIsla
Everyone safely out? Good.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - ExitBanterTibbsToIsla.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterTibbsToIslaTwo
Right... Why?
![[Tibbs, the Giant - ExitBanterTibbsToIslaTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterTibbsToIslaThree
The--... wait, what?
![[Tibbs, the Giant - ExitBanterTibbsToIslaThree.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterTibbsToVinderi
I think we've all earned an evening off.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - ExitBanterTibbsToVinderi.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterTibbsToNenet
I had a terrible feeling about this earlier. So glad I was wrong.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - ExitBanterTibbsToNenet.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterTibbsToNiles
That could've gone a lot worse!
![[Tibbs, the Giant - ExitBanterTibbsToNiles.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterTibbsToNilesTwo
...what did I even say to warrant that? Honestly.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - ExitBanterTibbsToNilesTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterTibbsToHuck
Nearly more loot than I can carry!
![[Tibbs, the Giant - ExitBanterTibbsToHuck.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterTibbsToHuckTwo
Nah mate, you're strong.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - ExitBanterTibbsToHuckTwo.ogg]]

No, Huck. You're strong.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - ExitBanterTibbsToHuckThree.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterTibbsToGianna
Good job everyone, let's head back.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - ExitBanterTibbsToGianna.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterKarstTibbsReply
Fine, but you're only getting pondwater, Karst.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - ExitBanterKarstTibbsReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterIslaTibbsReply
...and loot?
![[Tibbs, the Giant - ExitBanterIslaTibbsReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterVinderiTibbsReply
No way, mate.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - ExitBanterVinderiTibbsReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterVinderiTibbsReplyTwo
Absolutely not.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - ExitBanterVinderiTibbsReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterNenetTibbsReply
Wait... You thought we were going to die?
![[Tibbs, the Giant - ExitBanterNenetTibbsReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterNenetTibbsReplyTwo
And you didn't want to tell us?
![[Tibbs, the Giant - ExitBanterNenetTibbsReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterNilesTibbsReply
What do you mean?
![[Tibbs, the Giant - ExitBanterNilesTibbsReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterHuckTibbsReply
You've set the bar pretty low, mate.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - ExitBanterHuckTibbsReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterGiannaTibbsReply
Hoora--...aw.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - ExitBanterGiannaTibbsReply.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTibbsToKurai
Heard you could use a bit of muscle!
![[Tibbs, the Giant - SelectionBanterTibbsToKurai.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTibbsToKuraiTwo
Every time, I think I might get used to the stress, but...
![[Tibbs, the Giant - SelectionBanterTibbsToKuraiTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTibbsToKuraiThree
Of course, lady Kurai.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - SelectionBanterTibbsToKuraiThree.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTibbsToKuraiFour
Understood.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - SelectionBanterTibbsToKuraiFour.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTibbsToKarst
G'day
![[Tibbs, the Giant - SelectionBanterTibbsToKarst.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTibbsToKarstTwo
Do we have to do this every time?
![[Tibbs, the Giant - SelectionBanterTibbsToKarstTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTibbsToKarstThree
Fine, get it over with.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - SelectionBanterTibbsToKarstThree.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTibbsToKarstFour
Uh huh?
![[Tibbs, the Giant - SelectionBanterTibbsToKarstFour.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTibbsToKarstFive
Good try, champ. Now we grownups can focus on the job.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - SelectionBanterTibbsToKarstFive.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTibbsToIsla
What's the job?
![[Tibbs, the Giant - SelectionBanterTibbsToIsla.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTibbsToIslaTwo
My favourite kind. You bringing any new gadgets with us?
![[Tibbs, the Giant - SelectionBanterTibbsToIslaTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTibbsToIslaThree
Maybe for the best, eh?
![[Tibbs, the Giant - SelectionBanterTibbsToIslaThree.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTibbsToIslaFour
... Can't. Got plans. Very busy.
![[Tibbs, the Giant - SelectionBanterTibbsToIslaFour.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTibbsToVinderi
Hello everyone.

I always worry I'm late, even when I'm early.

Niles, do you think I'm stupid because I'm strong?

#### SelectionBanterTibbsToNilesThree
You think that a strong man cannot be a smart man, eh? The two are somehow mutually exclusive?
