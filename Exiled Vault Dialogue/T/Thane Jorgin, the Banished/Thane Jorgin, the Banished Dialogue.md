## Thane Jorgin, the Banished Dialogue
#### JorginPrimaryDefenderStartsFightZero
Ehh, what's this? A new challenger!
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginPrimaryDefenderStartsFightZero.ogg]]

#### JorginPrimaryDefenderStartsFightOne
Yea! Storm the keep, exile!
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginPrimaryDefenderStartsFightOne.ogg]]

#### JorginPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwo
Ohh, logistics is boring. Let's fight!
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwo.ogg]]

#### JorginPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThree
Ugh, please, do try and get this blooddy mess off ma mitts!
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThree.ogg]]

#### JorginPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFour
Surprise test of strength exile! Hope you're prepared.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFour.ogg]]

#### JorginPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFive
Our encounter will end very differently this time, exile.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFive.ogg]]

#### JorginPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSix
Let's solve this like men. With conflict, not cooperation!
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSix.ogg]]

#### JorginPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSeven
Here to play politics again, exile?
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSeven.ogg]]

#### JorginPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEight
Just who I was hoping to see today!
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEight.ogg]]

#### JorginPrimaryDefenderStartsFightNine
Back for more punishment, child?
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginPrimaryDefenderStartsFightNine.ogg]]

#### JorginPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTen
Ahhh! Gurhh... the Ursine Maw... it hungers!
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTen.ogg]]

#### JorginPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEleven
I am of Craiceann, solid against the tide!
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEleven.ogg]]

#### JorginPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwelve
I am of Saqawal, crushing my enemies!
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwelve.ogg]]

#### JorginPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThirteen
I am of Fenumus, dragging you down to your death!
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThirteen.ogg]]

#### JorginPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFourteen
I am of Farrul, swift as an arrow!
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFourteen.ogg]]

#### JorginSafehouseLeaderIntroZero
The strength of the First Ones runs in my veins. You will fall here and now.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginSafehouseLeaderIntroZero.ogg]]

#### JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero
Let this siege be savage.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero.ogg]]

#### JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne
First Ones, protect this caravan!
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne.ogg]]

#### JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo
I'll help defend this disgusting place only because I must.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo.ogg]]

#### JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree
I try never to miss a good ambush!
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree.ogg]]

#### JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour
I never back down from a fight!
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour.ogg]]

#### JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive
Strength in numbers is still strength!
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive.ogg]]

#### JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix
The First Ones have called me to your aid, wild one.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix.ogg]]

#### JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven
Cannah let you die, Grenn. I might need a ship back home someday!
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven.ogg]]

#### JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight
You're no Emperor, Janus, but my line will assist you again regardless.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight.ogg]]

#### JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine
Let us prove that the Syndicate has the might to make right.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine.ogg]]

#### JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalTen
Gadgets won't do the trick, Maloney. Allow me to lend ya some raw might.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalTen.ogg]]

#### JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalEleven
I want to see a proper siege!
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalEleven.ogg]]

#### JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwelve
I think I'll send these souls to the First Ones rather than the Lifegiver.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwelve.ogg]]

#### JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirteen
This horrible place deserves to fall!
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirteen.ogg]]

#### JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalFourteen
Even the mightiest warrior will fall against overwhelming numbers.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalFourteen.ogg]]

#### JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalFifteen
I'm more than just 'Ezomyte,' Janus. I'll show ya.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalFifteen.ogg]]

#### JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalSixteen
I don't know what the hell you are, but I much prefer the exile.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalSixteen.ogg]]

#### JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeventeen
The strongest deserve to rise, but you're too dumb to count.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeventeen.ogg]]

#### JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalEighteen
An Eternal General stood against the Ezomyte clans once before. Recall how that ended?
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalEighteen.ogg]]

#### JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalNineteen
Violence should be a test, Cameria, not a pastime.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalNineteen.ogg]]

#### JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwenty
Only the strongest deserve to rise.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwenty.ogg]]

#### JorginReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero
I welcome your challenge!
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero.ogg]]

#### JorginReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne
And I thought today would be boring.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne.ogg]]

#### JorginReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo
When a situation gets complicated, I tend to resort to violence.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo.ogg]]

#### JorginReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree
Don't ya see? We're in the middle of a test of strength here!
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree.ogg]]

#### JorginReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour
Big words big guy, but can you back them up?
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour.ogg]]

#### JorginReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive
We have about as much claim over these lands as your ilk, Eternal!
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive.ogg]]

#### JorginReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix
You've got your shot, creature. Show me that otherworldly might of yours.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix.ogg]]

#### JorginReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven
Aye and your skin will make a fine new cloak, Redblade!
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven.ogg]]

#### JorginReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight
Then I guess it stops with me, eh?
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight.ogg]]

#### JorginReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine
You better hope you have the strength to follow through, traitor!
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine.ogg]]

#### JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyOne
Let's see just how much this exile can handle, eh?
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyOne.ogg]]

#### JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyTwo
This caravan is better protected than you thought!
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyTwo.ogg]]

#### JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyThree
I won't let knowledge of my involvement here just walk out alive.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyThree.ogg]]

#### JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFour
Ohh, exile, you've quite the test now.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFour.ogg]]

#### JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFive
Let's try my way for this one, Tora.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFive.ogg]]

#### JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySix
It's the Ezomyte in charge of the Perandus this time, eh Janus?
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySix.ogg]]

#### JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySeven
Serve me well, Redblade. When I'm at the top, I won't forget it.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySeven.ogg]]

#### JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyEight
Support my rise through the ranks, Mutewind, and I'll use my power to get you what you truly desire.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyEight.ogg]]

#### JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyNine
Aye, you're certainly strong, Cameria, but! I'm stronger.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyNine.ogg]]

#### JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirty
As I am the strongest, I claim my right to lead this fight.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirty.ogg]]

#### JorginKillPlayerZero
I was hoping for a bigger storm.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginKillPlayerZero.ogg]]

#### JorginKillPlayerOne
The prize remains in the hands of the strongest.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginKillPlayerOne.ogg]]

#### JorginKillPlayerTwo
Eh, I was really hoping you'd burn this place.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginKillPlayerTwo.ogg]]

#### JorginKillPlayerThree
And the strongest remains the victor, ha ha ho!
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginKillPlayerThree.ogg]]

#### JorginEscapeZero
The weak fall. The strongest live to fight another day!
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginEscapeZero.ogg]]

#### JorginEscapeOne
A good clash. I like you, exile.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginEscapeOne.ogg]]

#### JorginEscapeTwo
Your strength was not enough to lift this rock. Maybe next time you'll send the bugs scattering.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginEscapeTwo.ogg]]

#### JorginDefeatedZero
I am... conquered... and impressed...
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginDefeatedZero.ogg]]

#### JorginDefeatedOne
The caravan... is yours...
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginDefeatedOne.ogg]]

#### JorginDefeatedTwo
The ultimate disgrace...
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginDefeatedTwo.ogg]]

#### JorginDefeatedThree
Well... you've passed ma test...
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginDefeatedThree.ogg]]

#### JorginDefeatedFour
I don't... want to be... caged again...
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginDefeatedFour.ogg]]

#### JorginDefeatedFive
I guess, uh, we should... talk?
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginDefeatedFive.ogg]]

#### JorginDefeatedSix
Might... politics... two sides of the same coin...
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginDefeatedSix.ogg]]

#### JorginDefeatedSeven
Kill me yet again... I'll return stronger. Thus, we evolve.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginDefeatedSeven.ogg]]

#### JorginDefeatedEight
Good show, exile. A real comeback.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginDefeatedEight.ogg]]

#### JorginDefeatedNine
Numbers alone... can't be counted on...
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginDefeatedNine.ogg]]

#### JorginDefeatedTen
It seems... I have... failed... my own test.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginDefeatedTen.ogg]]

#### JorginOfferBargainZero
I've seen your strength. Take from me what ya will.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginOfferBargainZero.ogg]]

#### JorginOfferBargainOne
Aye, you beat me fair and square, and I can respect that. But to beat the odds, to beat someone with friends in high places, that demands respect and awe. Free me, and select from my cohorts an ally, and we will see what you are truly made of.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginOfferBargainOne.ogg]]

#### JorginOfferBargainTwo
Might makes right, which means I work for you now, in a small fashion. You've only got hold over me worth one fight, which we all know is just one grain of sand in the desert of warfare. But it isn't nothing, and in warfare, information is as good as might. I've a friend in the Syndicate who is privy to key information, and I offer you this as your well-earned plunder.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginOfferBargainTwo.ogg]]

#### JorginOfferBargainThree
If I have a moment for last words, I'd like to say, above all, this job they have me doing is beyond boring. Now you're a strong one, so I value your input. Assuming you let me live, what do you think I should do instead?
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginOfferBargainThree.ogg]]

#### JorginOfferBargainFour
I have been soundly defeated. I'm man enough to admit that. It's my neck on the line here. But, if you let me go back to the green hills of Ogham, I'd certainly be hung for imagined crimes. How about you save yourself the bother and let my clan do what they will?
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginOfferBargainFour.ogg]]

#### JorginOfferBargainFive
This Syndicate is full of boring nonsense. Ya care to have a pint and talk it over? Or perhaps since you've got me dead to rights and all, skip the pint, and we'll go right to me blabbin' secrets like I'm drunk.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginOfferBargainFive.ogg]]

#### JorginOfferBargainSix
To the victor go the spoils. Take this as your reward... and let me go.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginOfferBargainSix.ogg]]

#### JorginBargainAcceptedZero
Consider it done, and consider the challenge begun!
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginBargainAcceptedZero.ogg]]

#### JorginBargainAcceptedOne
They'll never even suspect, boss.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginBargainAcceptedOne.ogg]]

#### JorginBargainAcceptedTwo
Let's hope for some entertainment.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginBargainAcceptedTwo.ogg]]

#### JorginBargainAcceptedThree
I wonder if they'll even remember my face back home. Hard to forget with all the wanted posters I expect, heh heh heh.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginBargainAcceptedThree.ogg]]

#### JorginBargainAcceptedFour
Strong and reasonable. I like you, exile!
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginBargainAcceptedFour.ogg]]

#### JorginBargainAcceptedFive
And the strong get stronger.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginBargainAcceptedFive.ogg]]

#### JorginOfferBetrayalZero
Impressive strength you've got there. You should use it to mold the Syndicate's hierarchy to your whims. Let me live, and you can install a leader here that sees eye to eye with you: me. You can't solve the Syndicate by killing, exile, but perhaps you can fundamentally change it for the better.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginOfferBetrayalZero.ogg]]

#### JorginOfferBetrayalOne
Death changes nothing, exile. Only philosophy, held true, alters the world. Here I say to you: the strongest should absorb the might of the weak and make it their own. For you, that means lettin' me live, so that I can maneuver within the organisation, stripping back the strength of others, making it my own. We do not stay dead, which means changing thoughts and minds is the only way you'll ever save the world from the Syndicate!
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginOfferBetrayalOne.ogg]]

#### JorginOfferBetrayalTwo
You've won the battle, exile, but the war will be long. You have the opportunity to select who it is you face. Now killin' me is an option, but you know already that I can be defeated. Who else here poses a threat? This is your chance to rig the game!
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginOfferBetrayalTwo.ogg]]

#### JorginOfferBetrayalThree
Hah hah, I like you, exile! There's no need to slay me, by the way. Let's just talk about the others here. I've got much to say.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginOfferBetrayalThree.ogg]]

#### JorginOfferBetrayalFour
Tora, she's a swift one. Now I don't think I can outpace her with force alone. Lend me your might and your mind for this, and the huntress will be forced to bow.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginOfferBetrayalFour.ogg]]

#### JorginOfferBetrayalFive
That's him, that's the bastard assassin that killed my brother! The Brotherhood of Silence!
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginOfferBetrayalFive.ogg]]

#### JorginOfferBetrayalSix
A Perandus betrayed my people long ago, yet the scars are still raw today. It's time I returned the favour!
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginOfferBetrayalSix.ogg]]

#### JorginOfferBetrayalSeven
The General's particular brand of might does not just raise the strong. It purges the weak and hopeless. This is not might. It's tyranny.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginOfferBetrayalSeven.ogg]]

#### JorginOfferBetrayalEight
Rin is pompous and uppity and... worst of all, she won't shut up about how she misses 'fresh mountain air,' like we don't all miss our homes! Now please, handle her before I do.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginOfferBetrayalEight.ogg]]

#### JorginOfferBetrayalNine
Allegiance is earned by might, be it muscle, magic, or maneuvering. This one's earned none of those.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginOfferBetrayalNine.ogg]]

#### JorginOfferExecuteZero
There's only one fate for the weak, exile. I have earned no exception.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginOfferExecuteZero.ogg]]

#### JorginOfferExecuteOne
Let the Syndicate witness the true path: strength of arm, strength of will!
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginOfferExecuteOne.ogg]]

#### JorginOfferExecuteTwo
If I should not return, bury me in Ogham, next to my brother.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginOfferExecuteTwo.ogg]]

#### JorginOfferExecuteThree
This time, do what must be done, exile.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginOfferExecuteThree.ogg]]

#### JorginReplyToBetrayalAcceptedZero
Strength is not merely muscle.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginReplyToBetrayalAcceptedZero.ogg]]

#### JorginReplyToBetrayalAcceptedOne
Aye, weak, through and through! A coward, just like your poisoning pretender, Chitus!
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginReplyToBetrayalAcceptedOne.ogg]]

#### JorginReplyToBetrayalAcceptedTwo
And I'll wager a guess: the First Ones hate ya too. And whatever serves as your mother, for good measure.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginReplyToBetrayalAcceptedTwo.ogg]]

#### JorginReplyToBetrayalAcceptedThree
Keep pushing me, Oriathan. My clan's itching for some Bloody Flowers of our own!
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginReplyToBetrayalAcceptedThree.ogg]]

#### JorginReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFour
I didn't kill my brother, you bastard!
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFour.ogg]]

#### JorginReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFive
Ah, ya fool Mutewind. I was framed and exiled here. Strange how quickly the Syndicate snapped me up once I arrived, yes?
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFive.ogg]]

#### JorginReplyToBetrayalAcceptedSix
Thus the weak seek to undermine the mighty.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginReplyToBetrayalAcceptedSix.ogg]]

#### JorginInterrogatedZero
I've nothin' to hide. Only strength matters.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginInterrogatedZero.ogg]]

#### JorginInterrogatedOne
You can starve the beast, but you will not break it.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginInterrogatedOne.ogg]]

#### JorginInterrogatedTwo
Exile, exile, ya really must learn!
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginInterrogatedTwo.ogg]]

#### JorginReplyToExecutionZero
The weak deserve death.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginReplyToExecutionZero.ogg]]

#### JorginReplyToExecutionOne
So it must be.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginReplyToExecutionOne.ogg]]

#### JorginReplyToExecutionTwo
Aye, the strong climb on the backs of the weak.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginReplyToExecutionTwo.ogg]]

#### JorginSafehouseLeaderDefeatedZero
Good, exile. The strongest wins. I knew one day it would not be me.
![[Thane Jorgin, the Banished - JorginSafehouseLeaderDefeatedZero.ogg]]
