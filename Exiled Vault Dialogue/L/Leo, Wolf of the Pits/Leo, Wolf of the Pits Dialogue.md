## Leo, Wolf of the Pits Dialogue
#### LeoMeeting1
Good to see a man cut from the same cloth as myself. Leo Redmane's the name, though no doubt the Grand Arena still remembers me.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoMeeting1.ogg]]

#### LeoMeeting2
A fine day to you. Leo Redmane's the name, though no doubt the streets of Theopolis still remember me. So welcome to the ruckus, Shadow. They would never have let you anywhere near an arena in Oriath, snooty bastards. But don't worry, no one's looking for a fair fight here.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoMeeting2.ogg]]

#### LeoMeeting3
Your brothers and sisters tend to get a raw deal in the arenas of Oriath. Drugged-up fodder for the bloodthirsty masses. Nothing like that going on with Leo Redmane's events, I promise you. So welcome to the ruckus, Marauder. Red's the only colour that matters to me.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoMeeting3.ogg]]

#### LeoMeeting4
I know your type aren't big on rules and regulations, Ranger. The wild doesn't have much use for them. I can respect that. So don't worry your pretty, little head about it. I, Leo Redmane, have only one rule in my events: Give it everything you've got. The audience loves a tryer.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoMeeting4.ogg]]

#### LeoMeeting5
Giving up your box seat for a place on the stage are we, your lordship? A bloody fine thing by Leo Redmane. The title isn't the man, if you know what I'm saying. And to be honest, 'winner' is the only title I've ever been interested in.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoMeeting5.ogg]]

#### LeoMeeting6
Leo Redmane's the name, m'lady, and it would be an honour to have one of such beauty and prowess grace my humble affrays. Welcome to the ruckus, darling. I am so looking forward to seeing you in action.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoMeeting6.ogg]]

#### LeoMeeting7
Got myself banished from Theopolis Arena for dealing with your kind, Witch. But this isn't Theopolis, and Leo Redmane's arena welcomes anyone who can put up a good fight... or a bad one. It's not the methods, but the ruckus that matters to me.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoMeeting7.ogg]]

#### MissionPvPDuelFirst
Get out there and shoulder-tap someone for a bit of casual biffo. Why are you looking at me like that? This isn't Theopolis. There are no marketeer fixers hustling to match-make you a duel. In Sarn, we pick our own fights. So go on, slap someone in the face with a gauntlet. Then come and see me when you've done fighting.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - MissionPvPDuelFirst.ogg]]

#### MissionPvPDuel
Find yourself an exile to take on and see if you can best them. We'll catch up when the ruckus is done.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - MissionPvPDuel.ogg]]

#### MissionPvPFFAFirst
It's the arena for you! Be honoured. That's not a suggestion, by the way. Be honoured. Sarn Arena is where everything and anything can happen. I never cease to be amazed by the spectacle when you throw a mixed bag of exiles into the old 'sand bucket'. An all day breakfast of free-range ruckus on toast. So get in there, and see how long you can take the heat. I'll be around to listen to your tales of woe when you're done.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - MissionPvPFFAFirst.ogg]]

#### MissionPvPFFA
Into the arena you go. Gird your loins and be ready for... well, pretty much anything! See you on the other side.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - MissionPvPFFA.ogg]]

#### MissionPvPTeamFirst
Let's see if you can play nicely with others. Not everyone's a lone wolf. It'd be a sad, lonely world if we were. There's many who stick with the pack, who thrive in the camaraderie of battle. Get out there, muster a pack and find yourself a battle. See if you can lead your friends to glory. We'll speak again after.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - MissionPvPTeamFirst.ogg]]

#### MissionPvPTeam
Get yourself a crew and go make some trouble. I'll look forward to hearing the gory details.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - MissionPvPTeam.ogg]]

#### MissionPvPCTFFirst
What you need is a goal. Yeah, I know. I sound like a school teacher when I say that. What I mean is, get out there, get yourself a crew together, and try your hand at capturing a flag or two. Exiles fighting together for something they believe in. Coveting, protecting... makes a man think there might be some hope for humanity. What? A man's got to care about something. We'll talk some more when the affray is done.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - MissionPvPCTFFirst.ogg]]

#### MissionPvPCTF
There's a flag out there with your name on it. Don't keep it waiting. I'll look forward to hearing the results.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - MissionPvPCTF.ogg]]

#### MissionPvPGenericFirst
Your timing couldn't be better! I've just the ruckus for you. A fresh affray for those who hunger for glory and violence. Think I'm talking it up a bit, do you? Well, that's my job. Don't tell me how to do my job and I won't tell you how to do yours... unless you're making a mess of it. And your job is to get in there and put in some good, clean violence. We'll talk after, if you're able.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - MissionPvPGenericFirst.ogg]]

#### MissionPvPGeneric
I've just the brutality you're looking for. No expense spared on my part. Come tell me all about it when you're done.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - MissionPvPGeneric.ogg]]

#### MissionPvP0GiveReward
You acquitted yourself fairly well that time. There's always room for improvement, of course.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - MissionPvP0GiveReward.ogg]]

#### MissionPvP1GiveReward1
You're a keen one, aren't you? Good. Keen blades are good for killing. Keen thoughts are good for living.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - MissionPvP1GiveReward1.ogg]]

#### MissionPvP1GiveReward2
Nicely done, for an amateur. Let me know when you feel like sharpening those skills of yours a bit more.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - MissionPvP1GiveReward2.ogg]]

#### MissionPvP2GiveReward
And here I thought I might have dumped you in the deep end.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - MissionPvP2GiveReward.ogg]]

#### MissionPvP3GiveReward1
Pretty fine work. Think you can top it next time?
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - MissionPvP3GiveReward1.ogg]]

#### MissionPvP3GiveReward2
You made a real statement, that time. I reckon we should keep you talking.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - MissionPvP3GiveReward2.ogg]]

#### MissionPvP3GiveReward3
You're on a bit of a roll, here!
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - MissionPvP3GiveReward3.ogg]]

#### MissionPvP3GiveReward4
Violence really suits you! Brings out the red in your eyes.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - MissionPvP3GiveReward4.ogg]]

#### MissionPvP3GiveReward5
You better be careful, or you're going to get a name for yourself!
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - MissionPvP3GiveReward5.ogg]]

#### MissionPvP3GiveReward6
You surely do put on a good show.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - MissionPvP3GiveReward6.ogg]]

#### LeoUpTo2
At this rate, we'll make quite the decent gladiator out of you. That said, I'm bit concerned about your gear. It's one thing to have talent, but if you don't have the right gear, you'll be a talented corpse. Flasks are a must-have, especially the ones that can wash away any ailments an enemy might curse you with. The fastest, strongest fighter can be rendered as slow and soft as a slug. Thaumaturgy's a bugger like that. Choose your flasks wisely and use them sparingly. They've got to last you the whole fight, remember. Anyway, have a look at the bits and bobs I've mustered here. Every item hand-picked to make other exile's lives miserable. See if anything takes your fancy.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoUpTo2.ogg]]

#### LeoUpTo2Hideout
Turns out you've found yourself a hideout. And as luck would have it, I find myself in need of somewhere to sleep. Maramoa's given me the boot, you see. Oh, you didn't know about us? Not surprised. Pretty tight-lipped about her private life, that girl. Wouldn't mention anything to her either, unless you're looking for a piece of axe. So, how about it? I don't take up much space, so there'll be plenty of room for others, and I'll defend your house like its my own. What do you say?
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoUpTo2Hideout.ogg]]

#### LeoUpTo3
You're proving to be quite the reliable one. I like predictability in an ally, helps me sleep at night. And as luck would have it, I've just found myself a new resting spot. Maramoa's given me the boot, you see. Oh, you didn't know about us? Not surprised. Pretty tight-lipped about her private life, that girl. Wouldn't mention anything to her, either, unless you're looking for a piece of axe. So, how about joining me, eh? I could do with the company and, as we all know, there's safety in numbers when it comes to living in Wraeclast.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoUpTo3.ogg]]

#### LeoUpTo3Hideout
So, you've gone and set up a cosy, little nest with one of the other masters, have you? It's your fight, your funeral, as they say. Should you change your mind though, I might still have a spot that'd serve the two us just as nicely, if not better. Defendable, comfortable, adaptable and whole lot of other 'ables' that escape me for the moment. What do you reckon? Take a look for curiosity's sake?
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoUpTo3Hideout.ogg]]

#### LeoCreateHideout
You won't regret this.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoCreateHideout.ogg]]

#### LeoHideoutDemo
Sure, it's no imperial penthouse, but if you've been keeping up with real estate these last couple hundred years, you'll notice that the Wraeclast market's been a bit flat. So what do you think? Is it a keeper?
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoHideoutDemo.ogg]]

#### LeoHideoutChosen
Well played, my friend. Well played. Of course, there's room for one or two others to join us, if you feel so inclined. I'm not fussy when it comes to house-mates, so I'll leave the choosing to you, eh? Just make sure none of them snore.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoHideoutChosen.ogg]]

#### LeoUpTo4
Bet you're itching to know how I ended up with a hook, right? Not half as much as my left hand itches in the middle of the night. The mind, eh? It's the damndest of things. But here it is. I got complacent. Been fighting in arenas and gutter pits so long I thought I knew it all. It took a waif of a girl with a rusty dirk to take my hand and my pride with one out-of-the-blue slash. So here's a bit of blood-earned wisdom for you. Life is a school from which you never graduate. Those who stop learning, start dying.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoUpTo4.ogg]]

#### LeoUpTo5
Since you seem pretty committed to proving yourself against your fellow exiles, here's a word of caution. Exsanguination.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoUpTo5.ogg]]

#### LeoUpTo6
You're getting quite a reputation for yourself in fighting circles. So here's another tip from the Redmane School of Not Dying, just to make sure you don't trip over your own pedestal. Some say you should focus on your strengths. That's good for the ego, not so good for keeping your throat unslit. Instead, drag your weaknesses kicking and screaming into the light, and give them a damned good looking-over. That'll help you protect your soft bits, but more importantly, it'll train your eye to spot weaknesses in others. Why go toe-to-toe with a man who has bigger toes than you, when it's his dodgy hamstring you should be going after?
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoUpTo6.ogg]]

#### LeoUpTo7
I wish we'd met back in Oriath. I could have made a bloody fortune out of you. Ah well, ancient history, that. Let's look to the present, and to keeping you from becoming ancient history yourself. I've met some mighty big hitters in my time, and picked up one valuable lesson from them: Don't get hit. A fighter can learn to take punishment. Body conditioning, armour, stamina... it all helps. But there are still attacks out there that'll cut through you like you're yesterday's bog paper. Best thing when one of those blows falls? Be somewhere else.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoUpTo7.ogg]]

#### LeoUpTo8
You probably know me well enough by now to understand that I don't say what I'm about to lightly. So here it is. You're a better fighter than I am. Better than Vagan, better even than the great Daresso, in my mind at least. And you know why you're better? You just don't bloody give up! That's what it takes for true mastery, inside the arena and out. Sure, we all know how to put the blood, sweat and tears into something. How to just keep swinging that sword until it hits what we want it to hit. That makes us good. But you, you're different. You're so full of the fight that you've forgotten how to live any other way. That's why you, my friend, are one of the Greats.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoUpTo8.ogg]]

#### LeoGiveCrafting
I know how exiles think and more importantly, how they fight. Oriathan and Karui, brawler and thaumaturge, I've seen every type of combatant. I've recorded their strengths and nutted out their weaknesses. What do I do with all this know-how? I carve and hammer it into weapons and other bits and bobs. I could teach you a thing or two about that, if you're willing. After all, if you're going to take down exiles, you'll need the right gear. Can't eat steak with a spoon, you know.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoGiveCrafting.ogg]]

#### LeoOnDailies
Speaking of which, stop in from time to time for a chat. I've always got a few events on the go. Exiles do love to bash each other... as if Wraeclast wasn't enough of a challenge for them! But now and then, I like to streamline things. Make sure the ruckus has a bit of form and grace to it. Time your visit right, and I'll be able to point you in the direction of a right, top-notch ruckus.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoOnDailies.ogg]]

#### LeoOnCrafting
Why should exile fight exile, you ask? This is our new home, so we need to get to know each other. And I reckon you can't truly know someone until you've fought them.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoOnCrafting.ogg]]

#### LeoOnPvPCharacter
You know, I've a few friends we should think about inviting over. Not your usual rank and file exile, all survivalism and vengeance. They're what I'd call your 'exile's exile', far more interested in beating the corruption out of each other than in taking on the twisted hordes out there. A sensible coping strategy, if you ask me. And a damned fine philosophy for producing gladiators! Anyway, you just say the word. I'm sure they'll be thrilled to meet you.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoOnPvPCharacter.ogg]]

#### LeoDaily
Another day, another ruckus. You feeling fighting fit?
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoDaily.ogg]]

#### LeoDailySelected
Good on you. Now, how can we best make use of your violent cravings?
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoDailySelected.ogg]]

#### LeoDismissed
Another day, another ruckus.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoDismissed.ogg]]

#### LeoOnVorici
Vorici's a backstabbing ponce with delusions of grandeur. I had a gutsful of his type back in Oriath. Now they're turning up in Wraeclast. There goes the neighbourhood.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoOnVorici.ogg]]

#### LeoOnCatarina
I don't mind admitting that Catarina scares me bloody rigid. Can't say I understand her obsession with the deceased, but it's not for me to tell anyone how to run their life, or death for that matter.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoOnCatarina.ogg]]

#### LeoOnTora
Tora's a pussy cat. Scratch her belly and she's all purrs. Pull her tail and she'll have your eyes out before you can blink.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoOnTora.ogg]]

#### LeoOnZana
Zana? I respect a woman who knows exactly where things are. Bloody helpful when you lose your keys.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoOnZana.ogg]]

#### LeoOnVagan
Vagan and I go way back. Even faced each other in the arena a few times in our younger days. He's not a bad bloke. It's just that I wish he'd been understanding enough to set up shop in some other part of Wraeclast. It's not the competition, I mind. It's the evening chinwags that get to me. A man likes to get a word in, now and then.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoOnVagan.ogg]]

#### LeoOnElreon
Never been one to believe in God myself, but damned if I'm going to tell Elreon that. Just in case I'm wrong, you see. A good fighter always knows where the exits are.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoOnElreon.ogg]]

#### LeoOnHaku
Haku's a bit on the intense side for my liking. It worries me when a man can't see the funny side of life. Makes him real dangerous.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoOnHaku.ogg]]

#### LeoOnArena
Eternals would travel from far and wide to see the spectacles of Sarn Arena. The gemling diva Kalisa gave her final performance in there for Emperor Chitus himself. Legend has it, on that same day, the first gemling legionnaire cut through four Ezomyte warriors in less time than it would've taken Kalisa to sing a single bar. It's seen more artists of war and of culture than any other place in the whole of Wraeclast. Whatever becomes of this land, I'm going to make damned sure of one thing. Sarn Arena will continue to celebrate the spirit of glory. God knows, we all need a bit of glory in a place like this.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoOnArena.ogg]]

#### LeoOnMarylane
Fair Marylene was one of the true greats of the arena in Sarn. Her skill with a longsword was second to none. Pinpoint accuracy and fast as a viper. As the story goes, she started out as a gutter kid, brought up by her maidservant mother. No one knew for sure who her dad was, but some pegged Kre Faarblood as the most likely candidate. Apparently sowed more than his fair share of wild oats in his day. You know why she was called 'Fair' Marylene? She was a looker, by all accounts, but that wasn't how she earned the nickname. It was down to her fighting style. The girl was a dancer, so sure on her feet that she was bloody near untouchable. Could be something you want to try. Not the dancing bit, not literally, but working on your movement. Some fighters learn to take the hits, others learn to avoid them. Never seen a fighter successfully do both.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoOnMarylane.ogg]]

#### LeoOnFaarblood
It's through studying the greats that you learn how to be great yourself. Fighters who live in isolation tend to die there.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoOnFaarblood.ogg]]

#### LeoOnTitucius
This isn't widely known, but Hector Titucius was an Ezomyte by birth.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoOnTitucius.ogg]]

#### LeoPrimaryDefenderStartsFightZero
Ah, good stuff. I was dying for a bit of biffo.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoPrimaryDefenderStartsFightZero.ogg]]

#### LeoPrimaryDefenderStartsFightOne
Welcome to the fun house!
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoPrimaryDefenderStartsFightOne.ogg]]

#### LeoPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwo
Get outta here, bloody pest!
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwo.ogg]]

#### LeoPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThree
Oi! You're not allowed down here!
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThree.ogg]]

#### LeoPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFour
Hate to pick an unfair fight, but...
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFour.ogg]]

#### LeoPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFive
Leaving a fighter to die in a cage? Not nice.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFive.ogg]]

#### LeoPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSix
No more deals. Just good, clean violence.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSix.ogg]]

#### LeoPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSeven
Forget the past. New day, new fight.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSeven.ogg]]

#### LeoPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEight
You gave my pride a bloody nose. Now the greave's on the other leg.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEight.ogg]]

#### LeoPrimaryDefenderStartsFightNine
Back for a grudge match, eh?
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoPrimaryDefenderStartsFightNine.ogg]]

#### LeoPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTen
Strength in numbers!
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTen.ogg]]

#### LeoPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEleven
Daresso would have been jealous!
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEleven.ogg]]

#### LeoPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwelve
My favourite thing's watching the colour drain from a foe's face.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwelve.ogg]]

#### LeoPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThirteen
This'll chill you to the bone, and beyond.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThirteen.ogg]]

#### LeoPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFourteen
Dodge this.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFourteen.ogg]]

#### LeoSafehouseLeaderIntroZero
Stormin' in here like that, completely disrespectful. I need to show you some manners.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoSafehouseLeaderIntroZero.ogg]]

#### LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero
Tag me in, mate!
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero.ogg]]

#### LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne
Stick together! What a ruckus.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne.ogg]]

#### LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo
Why's this bloody invader still alive?
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo.ogg]]

#### LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree
Seriously? You got the jump and you still need backup?
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree.ogg]]

#### LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour
Yes! Finally, a brawl!
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour.ogg]]

#### LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive
Been dyin' to slap each other around a bit.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive.ogg]]

#### LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix
Need a hand sweetie? I've only got the one.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix.ogg]]

#### LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven
Not so easy when it's a fair fight, is it Vorici?
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven.ogg]]

#### LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight
I'm here to blow a little wind into your sails, mate!
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight.ogg]]

#### LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine
You weren't going to leave me out of this brawl, were you, Thane?
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine.ogg]]

#### LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalTen
Leave some for me this time ya big bloody bastard.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalTen.ogg]]

#### LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalEleven
What bloody ruckus have you got us into?!
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalEleven.ogg]]

#### LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwelve
Mates, you're all screwed.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwelve.ogg]]

#### LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirteen
Let's turn this into a free for all.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirteen.ogg]]

#### LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalFourteen
Never take your eyes off the brawler.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalFourteen.ogg]]

#### LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalFifteen
Hook's dying to tear into some sinew and I don't much care whose.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalFifteen.ogg]]

#### LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalSixteen
Sorry huntress, but time's come to put you down.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalSixteen.ogg]]

#### LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeventeen
Vagan, this beating's for old-time's sake.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeventeen.ogg]]

#### LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalEighteen
Look at me! Now I'm a bloody backstabbing ponce. Not very fair, eh, Vorici?
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalEighteen.ogg]]

#### LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalNineteen
Back in the day I'd've given my left arm to take a swing at a Perandus.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalNineteen.ogg]]

#### LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwenty
Everyone loves an underdog, Hillock. And you're never the underdog.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwenty.ogg]]

#### LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyOne
This ain't my first battle royale, mates.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyOne.ogg]]

#### LeoReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero
Cage match then, is it?
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero.ogg]]

#### LeoReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne
Great, another body I'll have to lug around.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne.ogg]]

#### LeoReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo
So much for this place being secret.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo.ogg]]

#### LeoReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree
Free for all brawl!
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree.ogg]]

#### LeoReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour
Oh, how bloody kind.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour.ogg]]

#### LeoReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive
I mean, I get why you'd want a new face.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive.ogg]]

#### LeoReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix
Taking it to the spleen, maybe.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix.ogg]]

#### LeoReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven
Somehow I don't think you're hitting on me.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven.ogg]]

#### LeoReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight
Go on, then. Just try it.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight.ogg]]

#### LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyTwo
This defense has become a bloody siege.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyTwo.ogg]]

#### LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyThree
Looks like you could use another hand. Just the one though.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyThree.ogg]]

#### LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFour
Let's get this handled and get out.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFour.ogg]]

#### LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFive
Gotta swing the odds in our favour.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFive.ogg]]

#### LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySix
I know you're bloody dangerous, Haku, so let's aim that intensity in the right direction.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySix.ogg]]

#### LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySeven
Care to get swept up in my crusade, old man?
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySeven.ogg]]

#### LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyEight
I've got my eye on victory, Vagan. Let's do this.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyEight.ogg]]

#### LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyNine
It seems I'm your captain, Guff!
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyNine.ogg]]

#### LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirty
Just keep swinging, Hillock.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirty.ogg]]

#### LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirtyOne
The champ is here! What, no roaring crowd?
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirtyOne.ogg]]

#### LeoKillPlayerZero
Match: Leo.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoKillPlayerZero.ogg]]

#### LeoKillPlayerOne
I guess it's back to work then.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoKillPlayerOne.ogg]]

#### LeoKillPlayerTwo
Not a nice place to die, is it exile?
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoKillPlayerTwo.ogg]]

#### LeoKillPlayerThree
Didn't even get to use my signature one-handed throw!
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoKillPlayerThree.ogg]]

#### LeoEscapeZero
Don't worry, exile, this was a grudge match.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoEscapeZero.ogg]]

#### LeoEscapeOne
Thanks for the excitement, exile!
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoEscapeOne.ogg]]

#### LeoEscapeTwo
Missed it by that much.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoEscapeTwo.ogg]]

#### LeoDefeatedZero
How did I lose a bloody cage match?
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoDefeatedZero.ogg]]

#### LeoDefeatedOne
Urgh... too much of a ruckus.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoDefeatedOne.ogg]]

#### LeoDefeatedTwo
Gotta be honest. My heart wasn't in this one.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoDefeatedTwo.ogg]]

#### LeoDefeatedThree
Fair. Fair fight. Not bad.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoDefeatedThree.ogg]]

#### LeoDefeatedFour
No more time-outs, please...
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoDefeatedFour.ogg]]

#### LeoDefeatedFive
Even better with a weapon than with words...
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoDefeatedFive.ogg]]

#### LeoDefeatedSix
I'm really building a damaged reputation here.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoDefeatedSix.ogg]]

#### LeoDefeatedSeven
This one's going to hurt, isn't it?
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoDefeatedSeven.ogg]]

#### LeoDefeatedEight
Hah! I knew you'd get me back for killing you.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoDefeatedEight.ogg]]

#### LeoDefeatedNine
I shouldn't have jumped in like I did!
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoDefeatedNine.ogg]]

#### LeoDefeatedTen
Sure can pick 'em, can't ya Leo?
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoDefeatedTen.ogg]]

#### LeoOfferBargainZero
You should have given them the Redmane treatment. Make a statement! So what do you want from me?
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoOfferBargainZero.ogg]]

#### LeoOfferBargainOne
You won, so congratulations are in order. But the Syndicate's still going strong. Want to really hit us where it hurts? Then you've gotta let us team up. Take us down as a group! I'll even let you choose my teammate. Up for the challenge?
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoOfferBargainOne.ogg]]

#### LeoOfferBargainTwo
Don't snuff my candle just yet. I've got access to information you might find valuable. Just let me get in contact with a mate of mine, get a little drink in 'em. A little palling around and whammo, gossip galore. What do you say?
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoOfferBargainTwo.ogg]]

#### LeoOfferBargainThree
I'm a man of limited talents, as you can see. Only so much you can do with a hook, and apparently this wasn't one of 'em. You don't need to kick a man while he's down. Just let me figure out a plan B.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoOfferBargainThree.ogg]]

#### LeoOfferBargainFour
What if - and bear with me here - what if instead of gutting me, you just let me go? And I mean really go. Gone. Out of the Syndicate. Interested?
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoOfferBargainFour.ogg]]

#### LeoOfferBargainFive
You hear a lot of things when you spend enough time at one job. The sort of things someone like you might get some use out of. Only, there's no bloody way I'm telling you anything if you're just going to slice me to bits.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoOfferBargainFive.ogg]]

#### LeoOfferBargainSix
To the victor go the spoils. As in, actual treasure. Stuff you can swing and wear! Interested?
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoOfferBargainSix.ogg]]

#### LeoBargainAcceptedZero
Dunno about you, but I'm excited for the next round.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoBargainAcceptedZero.ogg]]

#### LeoBargainAcceptedOne
I guess it's time to play at spying.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoBargainAcceptedOne.ogg]]

#### LeoBargainAcceptedTwo
Next time you see me, I'll be a new man. With a new plan.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoBargainAcceptedTwo.ogg]]

#### LeoBargainAcceptedThree
Good choice, exile. I guess I'm off!
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoBargainAcceptedThree.ogg]]

#### LeoBargainAcceptedFour
You're a smart one, exile.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoBargainAcceptedFour.ogg]]

#### LeoBargainAcceptedFive
And the strong get stronger.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoBargainAcceptedFive.ogg]]

#### LeoOfferBetrayalZero
I preferred being the Pitmaster than a pit dog in my proverbial past life. Getting bloodied for money was never much fun. I reckon a few sneaky maneuvers and I could knock a Syndicate chump down a peg, leaving me to take their place. Might piss 'em off, but I think somehow you'll be fine with that.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoOfferBetrayalZero.ogg]]

#### LeoOfferBetrayalOne
Back in my arena-master days, I learned the power of prestige. To rise in the eyes of the crowd, others must fall. That's somethin' I've made sure to keep ready myself. Bloody the noses of my comrades-in-arms here and elevate myself. It's a power play.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoOfferBetrayalOne.ogg]]

#### LeoOfferBetrayalTwo
A bad apple spoils the bunch. Put bluntly, one monkey's arse can damage the whole crowd's enthusiasm. Get what I'm gettin' at? I make it my business to retain the ability to kick someone out of the rosters entirely.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoOfferBetrayalTwo.ogg]]

#### LeoOfferBetrayalThree
If it's information you're after, no better to converse with than Leo Redmane. I've befriended all of my comrades-in-arms, and I can tell you all about their roles and fighting strategies... if you'll spare me a certain amount of pain in exchange.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoOfferBetrayalThree.ogg]]

#### LeoOfferBetrayalFour
Hate to double-cross an old mate, but Vagan's man enough to deal with it. Plus, I owe him one.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoOfferBetrayalFour.ogg]]

#### LeoOfferBetrayalFive
Look, I get why you want to kill me. I do. But Perandus! Bloody Perandus! Doesn't that name just make you... Rrrrg! Perandus!
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoOfferBetrayalFive.ogg]]

#### LeoOfferBetrayalSix
A professional like myself knows that when the fight's over, the fight's over. Hillock... well, the fight's never really over in his head. Put the poor bastard out of his misery.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoOfferBetrayalSix.ogg]]

#### LeoOfferBetrayalSeven
I love a bit of violence. Who among us doesn't? But there's a time and a place. For Cameria, the time is always and the place is wherever he happens to bloody be. I just can't stand it.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoOfferBetrayalSeven.ogg]]

#### LeoOfferBetrayalEight
When a fight's over, the fighter's job is done. We go home, tend to our wounds, and train for the next round. When Aisling's done fighting, well, that's just the beginning. The things she does to the bodies... I'm intimidating, but she's scary.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoOfferBetrayalEight.ogg]]

#### LeoOfferBetrayalNine
An arena fighter knows, once the fight is over, respect is what counts. Think anyone else in the Syndicate would say the same?
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoOfferBetrayalNine.ogg]]

#### LeoOfferExecuteZero
Always hoped I'd get a warrior's death.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoOfferExecuteZero.ogg]]

#### LeoOfferExecuteOne
Look at the situation you've put me in. The only way you'll get me to spill my guts is literally.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoOfferExecuteOne.ogg]]

#### LeoOfferExecuteTwo
I'll take this one for the team.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoOfferExecuteTwo.ogg]]

#### LeoOfferExecuteThree
My days in the cage are over. End our conflict, and make a good show of it.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoOfferExecuteThree.ogg]]

#### LeoReplyToBetrayalAcceptedZero
Knew you were weak. Bloody knew it.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoReplyToBetrayalAcceptedZero.ogg]]

#### LeoReplyToBetrayalAcceptedOne
Next time it'll be you, old friend.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoReplyToBetrayalAcceptedOne.ogg]]

#### LeoReplyToBetrayalAcceptedTwo
Go neck yourself, mate.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoReplyToBetrayalAcceptedTwo.ogg]]

#### LeoReplyToBetrayalAcceptedThree
Righto, Redblade. You're on my list.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoReplyToBetrayalAcceptedThree.ogg]]

#### LeoReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFour
You really are a bastard, aren't you.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFour.ogg]]

#### LeoReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFive
Must be nice, having absolutely no conscience whatsoever.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFive.ogg]]

#### LeoReplyToBetrayalAcceptedSix
Is it really in your best interests to piss off a bloody arena fighter?
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoReplyToBetrayalAcceptedSix.ogg]]

#### LeoInterrogatedZero
You say prison cell, I hear 'holiday.'
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoInterrogatedZero.ogg]]

#### LeoInterrogatedOne
You know what she does to me in there? Please. Please no.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoInterrogatedOne.ogg]]

#### LeoInterrogatedTwo
Wait, what about a deal? What about last time?
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoInterrogatedTwo.ogg]]

#### LeoReplyToExecutionZero
You should have given them the Redmane treatment. Make a statement.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoReplyToExecutionZero.ogg]]

#### LeoReplyToExecutionOne
Death is what separates the wolves from the pups.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoReplyToExecutionOne.ogg]]

#### LeoReplyToExecutionTwo
If you hadn't done it, I probably would've.
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoReplyToExecutionTwo.ogg]]

#### LeoSafehouseLeaderDefeatedZero
Bugger. How about a rematch, eh?
![[Leo, Wolf of the Pits - LeoSafehouseLeaderDefeatedZero.ogg]]
