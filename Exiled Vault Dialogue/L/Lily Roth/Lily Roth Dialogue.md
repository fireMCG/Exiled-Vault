## Lily Roth Dialogue
#### Introduction
I'm Captain Lilly Roth, and we sail... for Wraeclast. Better to live in exile than die on this psychotic bonfire of an island. You want to make it out of here, you better get on board. But make it quick, 'cause I ain't got time for tears and regrets.
![[Lily Roth - Introduction.ogg]]

#### Sail to Wraeclast
Remember, this ain't no charity run. You owe me. Cast off!
![[Lily Roth - Sail to Wraeclast.ogg]]

#### Introduction_2
Alright, we're safe for the time being. Now let me introduce myself properly. Lilly Roth. Yeah, I'm one of {those} Roths. Some call me 'smuggler', others 'pirate', yet I prefer the sound of 'nautical entrepreneur'. Came up with that one meself. So you come see Lilly if you need something, or even if you just fancy a good chat with a lovely lady.
![[Lily Roth - Introduction_2.ogg]]

#### Tarkleigh
Yeah, I {knew} Tarkleigh, if you catch me drift. He's got no time for his old bunkmate these days though. Too gaga-eyed over his lost cause of a fishwife, Nessa. Time was, Tarkleigh and I would smuggle all 'bout the coast of Oriath. Ah, good days they was. Sweet with rum, nothing but the wind and salt in our faces, freedom in our hearts... and the law on our tails. But I could tell he were getting ready to make feet for children's stockings with me, so I cut him loose. Not a spark's chance under the ocean the dreaded Lilly Roth's gonna wind up swelling like some drowned carcass. Still, nice to work with that bugger one more time, just for old time's sake, you know?
![[Lily Roth - Tarkleigh.ogg]]

#### Bestel
That scallywag? I reckon Bestel thinks I be kind of lass who'd bed down with any sort of rascal. Ha, not too far off I guess. He is rather sweet, but not the most comely of figures. Actually, he kinda reminds me of me Grandfather, Weylam Roth. A poet and scoundrel extraordinaire, he be. Bestel's but spittle from the mouth of Old 'Rot-tooth' Roth. Ahem... "Buss my blind cheeks," said the Sailor to the Doxie. She sports her dairy treats afar, and relishes her moxie. But a fire ship'll sink the broken 'neath the ocean waves. Tip nutmegs a deadly token, sends captains to their graves!"
![[Lily Roth - Bestel.ogg]]

#### Trade
You have the look of a wayfarer about you. I've a few bits and bobs in the hold that I managed to salvage from Oriath. Might be you're in the market for a little insurance for the road? The sort a nautical charm or a quaff of tonic be providing. Go on, have a look-see, and if you be thinking to trade, I reckon we can come to a fair arrangement.
![[Lily Roth - Trade.ogg]]

#### Weylam Roth
Weylam Roth... here, let me share something I remember from me granddaddy's stories. No sooner had the others turned in fear from the great, white Leviathan, did Weylam load the ballista with his final harpoon. And right then he vowed, to sea and sky, that he and he alone would be the one to finally kill this bastard son of the Brine King. The ballista fired and the harpoon smote that creature right between the ribs as it made to dive back under the angry sea. Thick clouds of blood bloomed beneath the waves, roses flowering in the black water, and impossible though it seemed, the already shadowed ocean grew darker still... He used the bones of the great beast to reinforce the hull of his ship, the Black Crest. Old Rot-tooth, he's a true legend. A real pirate hero. I can only hope, one day, me own stories will reach his ears and make him proud of the granddaughter he had to leave behind.
![[Lily Roth - Weylam Roth.ogg]]

#### The Black Flag
You've got the Black Flag from me grandfather's ship? Ah, the Black Crest were the most formidable ship to ever sail the seas. Yet now it's a hulk of rotted wood and bone, mouldering away in that forsaken graveyard. But why is it there? You don't think that Merveil... Never! I won't even think it. No Roth would ever fall victim to that tentacled sea-hag. Weylam must be out there somewhere. Yeah, a castaway, that's it. For now, you'll be after safe passage to the Brine King's Reef. And there ain't no ship going to get you there faster than the Black Crest. So, as the only Roth present and accounted for right now, I hereby give you permission to burn that flag in the Beacon. Might as well see if there's some truth in that old legend about it resurrecting the wrecks of Roths past... and, other less notable vessels. Maybe when this is all done, I'll take back the Black Crest for meself and sail out in search of me grandfather. He's too hardy an old barnacle to kill, so he'll be out there, somewhere.
![[Lily Roth - The Black Flag.ogg]]

#### The Brine King
Yeah, I know the Brine King. What pirate doesn't? Drowned me fair share of mutineers under the full moon... to keep the old king's slumber when storms threaten, you see. If he's been roused from the depths, it be nothing but ill tidings for those of us with air in our lungs. He'll be getting back to raping and eating us ocean-going folk soon enough. Stealing wombs in which to spawn his slithering offspring. Aye, that blasphemy is out there somewhere right now, I'd wager. And to think there still be folks needing transport from Oriath... more commissions to be had. But a lecherous sea god, now that complicates things.
![[Lily Roth - The Brine King.ogg]]

#### The Brine King_2
The Black Crest, she lives again! And me granddaddy... still can't believe Merveil did that to him, the bilesome bitch! At least his spirit roams free once again. Wonder if he'll come and visit his favourite granddaughter one more time... Anyways, with the Brine King gone, you've done a fine thing for us seafarers. The waters won't no longer pander to the whim of an overgrown bloody crustacean, and damn me if I don't feel a stirring in me loins. It's the ocean, calling... like a lust-starved lover. But for now, bugger it all, I'll be sticking about Lioneye's Watch until I get me a new ship. Nah, don't feel sorry for me. With me womanly wiles as sharp they are, I'll be having Tarkleigh help me pass the time, just you see.
![[Lily Roth - The Brine King_2.ogg]]

#### The Twilight Strand
Don't think I be forgetting that favour you owes me! In fact, now I think of it, there's certainly a way you can be repaying this most considerable debt. You see, those blasted cultists have been plundering the refugee ships trying to escape Oriath, and if not for my incomparable skill as a sea captain, we'd have met the same fate. But now the drowned dead are washing ashore, and they ain't staying dead. There's been a whole lot of blood, sweat and tears getting these few lucky survivors here in one piece. What sorta Captain would I be if I let them get ripped apart by walking corpses? Wipe the Twilight Strand clean of those filthy undead bastards and I'll call us even. Might even throw in a little something extra, if you can pull it off.
![[Lily Roth - The Twilight Strand.ogg]]

#### The Twilight Strand_2
A wretched sight, so many drowned Oriathans, cast into undeath... You've freed them from their torment and I'm sure they be grateful. Here, that little something extra I were talking about. Though the sea takes away, it gives back in greater measure.
![[Lily Roth - The Twilight Strand_2.ogg]]

#### LillyCallOut
Get yer soggy arse aboard 'fore we stick ya with a fishing spear!
![[Lily Roth - LillyCallOut.ogg]]

#### Rescue
You're questioning me? The great sea-mistress Lilly Roth, about how she so happened to find you, failing at drowning, on some godforsaken fleshy piece of land? Thought it'd be obvious. Grandfather and I, we came to thank you for our little reunion here, you started. Caught wind that you were playing around up here with that dead beast from the locals. So we followed yer trail, dreaden we'd be findn' yer body bits strewn all over this godforsaken mountain. But lo and behold, what do we get? Our favourite exile, twiddling their thumbs. Yer lucky ol' Weylam's still got some thaumaturgical prowess in his bones. How the hell did you end up here anyhow?
![[Lily Roth - Rescue.ogg]]

#### Oriath
Well, I suppose you'll be wanting us to ferry you over to Oriath... take care of that nasty cannibal god, Kitava, once and for all? Well, we'd be glad to oblige. There be plenty of treasures in ruined Theopolis just sitting there for the taking, I'm sure. Say the words and we'll set the sails.
![[Lily Roth - Oriath.ogg]]

#### Sail to Oriath
Ready to go? Just in time as well. Granddad says there be a good thaumaturgical headwind blowing our way.
![[Lily Roth - Sail to Oriath.ogg]]

#### Virtue Gems
While you be skulking about, I've managed to do a bit of hunting on me own. Got a hull-full of baubles and trinkets here. Which I managed to... "procure." Take a look, you might find something particularly naughty to help you on yer life's voyage.
![[Lily Roth - Virtue Gems.ogg]]

#### Welcome
Well, once more, you owe me... for letting ya sail around on me ship. But that's okay, I'm the kinda gal who can play the long game. Sometime in the future I'll be in need of yer services once more. You can pay me back then... Alright, come on, you've got a job ta do. Lives to save, gods ta kill, better get to it.
![[Lily Roth - Welcome.ogg]]

#### Bannon
That Bannon's a real siren if yer ask me. Even after the beating he's taken! Bulging muscles, pretty yella hair... I be willing to bet the barrel of his piece's longer than a ship's mast as well, if you be understanding me drift... It's a shame in all honesty that he's one of them foolish holy men. Though even that ain't so bad, Lilly Roth loves herself a challenge.
![[Lily Roth - Bannon.ogg]]

#### Innocence
Ol' Bannon, I'd stake my bets on being a mighty fine demon in the sack. Can't go wrong with a man in uniform! Only now, he's gone and transformed into that pesky 'God of Light'! I've gotta believe that the man is still in there somewhere, but finding my way into his bedsheets at this stage is proving more difficult than I first thought. Don't seem to be anything that'll budge him from wherever he's hiding, not even an enrapturing roll in the hay with this future pirate queen! Seems to me that by lettin' ol' Innocence take him over completely, it's like a leech sucking the life right out of him. He's gonna lose out on all them lusty joys of this world, and that ain't something I'd ever think fondly about.
![[Lily Roth - Innocence.ogg]]

#### Kitava
Not much I can say about that raving monster. While he still breathes, it fares ill for all of us. There ain't no amount of ocean we can put between us and him that Kitava won't see as simply an extra dreg of wine in his cup.
![[Lily Roth - Kitava.ogg]]

#### The Teardrop
Were a long time ago now, but them Privateers, took the Teardrop, threw it in the Reliquary, then took yers truly, and threw me in those goddamn slave pens. Far as I can tell, they never did work out what the Teardrop were for. Lucky me I suppose. It were tough, but with the help of a few other undesirables, I managed to find me way out of them pens and into the Reliquary, made an attempt to burgle back what was burgled from me. Boy, did we sure underestimate the size of them guards the Templars had on the place. Only I managed to escape unscathed. Me accomplices weren't to be so lucky... they ended up in Wraeclast, much like yerself. Fact, I believe you may've crossed paths. Kraityn, Alira... Oak.
![[Lily Roth - The Teardrop.ogg]]

#### Tsoatha
Every sell-dwelling lad or lass knows of Tsoatha. They call it a city, but it were more of a slaughterhouse than anything else. Old Salty himself ruled over the place, treating its citizens as morsels from his own personal pantry. Those who weren't devoured outright were picked to try continue his family line - they became fish wives, like that pretty young Nessa near ended up being. Well, the Brine King, as you know was forced into a slumber 'neath the ocean, and the city was said to have joined him there as well. A few folk managed to flee from the collapsing coral shards, start new lives for themselves, but I'll be reckoning they left all their valuables behind.
![[Lily Roth - Tsoatha.ogg]]

#### Map to Tsoatha
Now that the Brine King is nothing but crab meat, his sunken domain, the ancient city of Tsoatha, is ripe for the plundering. Me grandaddy once dedicated a good portion of his sailing life, trying ta hunt down the location of that monolithic city. Then, while he were... otherwise indisposed, yers truly tried to follow in his gnarled footsteps, track down the Teardrop - a pearl as big as your head, carved with the clues to the city's subaquatic location. I were this close to completing me grandfather's legacy, when those damn Templar privateers raided me ship and took off with the Teardrop, threw it in their Reliquary, here in Theopolis. As it were, now's the perfect time to retrieve that dazzling pearl. Think you can nab it for me? I'll make it worth yer while, maybe tick it off the list of things you owe me?
![[Lily Roth - Map to Tsoatha.ogg]]

#### Map to Tsoatha_2
Exile, you're a giant among men! You got no idea how long I have yearned to have this beauty once more in me hands. The Teardrop is surprisingly still in pretty good condition - not too typical of the baubles them Templars like to steal. We'll stick around a while longer, but once things settle down, my grandfather and I, we'll be setting sail with Tsoatha firm in our sights.
![[Lily Roth - Map to Tsoatha_2.ogg]]

#### LillyOnKitavaDead
I suspect you're about ready for a flagon of ale and a pretty wench or swain, whatever it be that's yer persuasion. The great exile of Oriath, returns to a Theopolis in chaos and ends the life of a raving cannibal god... now that's a story worth the songs of many an ancient muse. Well, alls I can rightly say is congratulations my friend. A year ago, I wouldn't have dreamt I'd be someday soon in the company of a killer of gods. My advice, you better get while the getting's good and have yourself a holiday before Oriath or Wraeclast or whoever else has need for your unique services once more.
![[Lily Roth - LillyOnKitavaDead.ogg]]

#### Kitava_2
By the high seas, you actually did it! You won a duel for the ages against Kitava himself! Sailors will be singing shanties about your victory for generations to come. But if I've learned anything from you, Duelist: it's best to leave them wanting more. Let's find you a flagon of ale and a fresh start. Leave the rebuilding to those better suited than scoundrels like us.
![[Lily Roth - Kitava_2.ogg]]

#### Kitava_3
A sombre day, when a man has slain his own gods. Tukohama, adored, Kitava, hated, but both Karui gods all the same. You've had quite the journey, and waged quite the war. Whaddya say, Marauder? After all this, is it finally time to go home? We can set sail for your Archipelago the moment you give the word. We'll check in on these fine folk after they've had some time to figure things out.
![[Lily Roth - Kitava_3.ogg]]

#### Kitava_4
You won the day, but you look more than frazzled, Witch. Might be time to bury your head in some forbidden occult books for a while... or whatever it is you do for fun. I know folks like us aren't suited to rebuilding efforts and honest work. Just say the word, and we'll sail on out of here.
![[Lily Roth - Kitava_4.ogg]]

#### Kitava_5
You look as though you've seen more bloodshed than you'd care to admit. Maybe it's time for you to step out of the darkness and do some honest pirating and pillaging for a change. Whaddya say, Shadow? We can check back in on these fine upstanding folk when they've sorted their business.
![[Lily Roth - Kitava_5.ogg]]

#### Kitava_6
So, Templar, you've defeated Kitava and saved the good people of Oriath and Wraeclast, but at what cost? I heard that god of yours is going into self-imposed exile in the frozen south. Helping you sail around searching for Innocence sounds more like penance than fun, but it's the least I can do. We're not going to find him, mind you. But it's all about the journey with you folk, not the destination, inninit? We'll give it a year, then come back and see how these proper citizens are doing. Just say the word, and we'll set sail.
![[Lily Roth - Kitava_6.ogg]]

#### Kitava_7
It's funny, Ranger, that you had to fight across all of Wraeclast and Oriath to win the right to finally be left alone. I could do with some peace and quiet myself. Let's just you and me sail on out of here before they put us to work rebuilding. We can always visit once they're done. How's that sound? Just say the word, and we'll set sail.
![[Lily Roth - Kitava_7.ogg]]

#### Kitava_8
The world's saved then, it seems. I never doubted you, Scion. But what will you do now? Somehow, I think a woman like you thrives on a challenge. There's a whole world out there, and you can go anywhere, do anything. Me and this old ship of mine'll take you. Least I can do, what for saving our lives and all. Say the word, and we'll set sail towards the future.
![[Lily Roth - Kitava_8.ogg]]

#### Karui Shores
I should have never come back here. That Kirac is a mighty convincing salesman. I spent so much of my life voyaging across the briny deep, looting and pillaging, I never thought I'd end up working as a naval officer for the Citizen Vanguard. They're forgiving my pirating crimes in exchange for helping to build this town, as well as providing trade and transport. It'll be a quiet life, but rewarding in its own way. I'd rather be a seafarer than a footsoldier.
![[Lily Roth - Karui Shores.ogg]]

#### Invite to Hideout
I'll bring my chest of gems, and enough ale to put down forty men!
![[Lily Roth - Invite to Hideout.ogg]]
