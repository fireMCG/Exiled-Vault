#### Rescued
He killed Eamon. Just killed him. I... I don't know what to do... I...

#### Return to Clearfell
Clearfell is safe... we have to get out of here. We can talk there.

#### LeitisIntro
For what it's worth, my name is Leitis. I appreciate the rescue, but... Eamon... everything I know... it's all gone. It isn't worth much, but take this. Perhaps it will aid you against that monster.

#### Count Geonor
There is only one thing for certain. Count Geonor must die. He ordered the guard to round up everyone in the village, and when we resisted, they burned it to the ground. Enter the Manor. Take our vengeance upon him!

#### The Mad Wolf is Dead
So, it is done. The Count is dead. Where once there was a fire in my heart, there is now nothing but ash. For enacting my vengeance, you have some measure of thanks from me. Now please, go. Do what you must, but leave me be.

#### The Seed of Corruption
So... you know of it. I remember the night it all began the Count and his men returned in the witching hour, carrying something hidden from sight. We didn't know what it was at the time, but we certainly learned soon. It was alive, and he needed to feed it.

#### Feeding the Beast
The changes came slowly. There were whispers of the downtrodden and clanless going missing. Nobody of consequence. The Count's men were simply cleaning up the ne'er-do-wells. Those that contributed nothing. But then the Count started changing the penalties for common crimes. Five men were arrested after a simple scuffle over payment. A woman was arrested for {adultery}, like we were somehow living under the tyranny of the Eternals all over again. Charges became commonplace for almost anything. Living in the Manor, my... my husband... and I were somewhat protected, but we saw what was happening. All of these 'criminals' were sentenced to hard labour, digging away beneath the Manor, until their strength was spent. When that happened... he hanged them, and threw their bodies to that... {creature.}

#### Digging
I don't know what the Count is looking for beneath the Manor. Perhaps he hopes for proof that his heritage is actually pure. Perhaps he's just gone well and truly mad. He's torn a massive hole right in the middle of the Manor, a living testament to what he's done to our way of life.

#### The Manor
That place is a madhouse. Every day was spent threading a careful line. Question the Count, and you'd get arrested. Flatter him too much, and he'd grow paranoid, and arrest you anyway. The Countess watched all of us with cold eyes. The nobles began to change... strange proclivities emerged. They brought lone villagers into their rooms in the dead of night, never to be seen again. Eamon and I tried to flee, but they caught us.

#### The Countess
When she came to us from the Vastiri Desert, we nobles were just happy the Count had finally found a wife. If we had known what was to come, we never would have celebrated. From the moment she arrived, she spent her time whispering dreadful little barbs in his ear. He became rather agitated, and started doubting himself... doubting his bloodline. He had a scholar repeatedly investigate whether the Eternals had... {dirtied}... his ancestry. When he found out that he might have had an unwelcome interloper in his family tree, he became fixated on proving himself, even though we all repeatedly assured him he already {had} our loyalty. He's been obsessed with gaining power ever since, and I think the Countess promised him a way to achieve it.
