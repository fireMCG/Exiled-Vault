## Niles, the Interrogator Dialogue
#### EntryBanterTullinaNilesReply
Luck is just another word for faith, which we all know is meaningless. You're telling everyone good nothing right now.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - EntryBanterTullinaNilesReply.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterNilesToTullina
Tullina, might I slip into that brain of yours for just a moment? I wish to feel lithe. Provocative.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - EntryBanterNilesToTullina.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterTullinaNilesReply
Oh, how one quivers with anticipation at the thought of such sweet fruits.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - ExitBanterTullinaNilesReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterNilesToTullina
Glorious, glorious, glorious. I sup the wine of victory from fate's breast.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - ExitBanterNilesToTullina.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterNilesToTullinaTwo
When we return, I shall paint it for you. A gift.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - ExitBanterNilesToTullinaTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTullinaNilesReply
What exquisite torture it is to wait for one as beautiful as yourself.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - SelectionBanterTullinaNilesReply.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTullinaNilesReplyTwo
Until I wear you down.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - SelectionBanterTullinaNilesReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTullinaNilesReplyThree
Ha! I doubt I'm making everyone--
![[Niles, the Interrogator - SelectionBanterTullinaNilesReplyThree.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNilesToTullina
Hello, hello... Ah, Tullina!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - SelectionBanterNilesToTullina.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNilesToTullinaTwo
What a pleasure to be called into service by your side.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - SelectionBanterNilesToTullinaTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNilesToTullinaThree
But it remains my pleasure, and for that, I simply must thank you.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - SelectionBanterNilesToTullinaThree.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNilesToTullinaFour
Thank you.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - SelectionBanterNilesToTullinaFour.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterNilesToAdiyah
Have I ever told you that your mind is incredibly ordered?
![[Niles, the Interrogator - ExitBanterNilesToAdiyah.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterNilesToAdiyahTwo
Or oppression. I know a little about that.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - ExitBanterNilesToAdiyahTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterNilesToAdiyahThree
Maraketh witch!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - ExitBanterNilesToAdiyahThree.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterAdiyahNilesReply
You cannot reject that which does not exist!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - ExitBanterAdiyahNilesReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterAdiyahNilesReplyTwo
You go on believing that.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - ExitBanterAdiyahNilesReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterTibbsNilesReply
A prayer? I might as well ask the Solstice Rhoa for an albino egg! Equally absurd!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - EntryBanterTibbsNilesReply.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterNilesToTibbs
Tibbs, could you please lower your anxiety? It's seeping into my brain.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - EntryBanterNilesToTibbs.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterTibbsNilesReply
And of course it was because of some god's intervention, right? So predictable.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - ExitBanterTibbsNilesReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterNilesToTibbs
This was a wondrous return to the glory days of the Templars.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - ExitBanterNilesToTibbs.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterNilesToTibbsTwo
Well, all the killing and mind-crushing. It was... nostalgic.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - ExitBanterNilesToTibbsTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTibbsNilesReply
Are you sure? Are there no... large words I should explain to you?
![[Niles, the Interrogator - SelectionBanterTibbsNilesReply.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTibbsNilesReplyTwo
Well... Not exactly...
![[Niles, the Interrogator - SelectionBanterTibbsNilesReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTibbsNilesReplyThree
Well--
![[Niles, the Interrogator - SelectionBanterTibbsNilesReplyThree.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTibbsNilesReplyFour
I-... I rescind my statement. I apologise for my preconceived notions.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - SelectionBanterTibbsNilesReplyFour.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNilesToTibbs
I'm here, no need to make a fuss.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - SelectionBanterNilesToTibbs.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNilesToTibbsTwo
And to you. You know, I've always wondered, where do you get your clothes?
![[Niles, the Interrogator - SelectionBanterNilesToTibbsTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNilesToTibbsThree
Fascinating. To see a man of your stature wield a sewing needle must truly be something to behold.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - SelectionBanterNilesToTibbsThree.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNilesToTibbsFour
The contrast, Most humourous.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - SelectionBanterNilesToTibbsFour.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterKarstNilesReply
No gods will ensure success. That's up to us.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - EntryBanterKarstNilesReply.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterNilesToKarst
Confidence, not cockiness, will ensure success.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - EntryBanterNilesToKarst.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterNilesToKarstTwo
That is always what an interrogator wanted to hear: his own words repeated back to him with desperation.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - EntryBanterNilesToKarstTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterKarstNilesReply
At last, a belief system I can get behind.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - ExitBanterKarstNilesReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterNilesToKarst
Our persistence is rewarded. Even the supposed gods couldn't--
![[Niles, the Interrogator - ExitBanterNilesToKarst.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterKarstNilesReply
The locksmith. Good, good.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - SelectionBanterKarstNilesReply.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterKarstNilesReplyTwo
Of course. My apologies. I sense ...animosity.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - SelectionBanterKarstNilesReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterKarstNilesReplyThree
It is a well-honed talent.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - SelectionBanterKarstNilesReplyThree.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNilesToKarst
A job. Splendid.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - SelectionBanterNilesToKarst.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNilesToKarstTwo
It is me.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - SelectionBanterNilesToKarstTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNilesToKarstThree
I don't believe that decision is yours to make.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - SelectionBanterNilesToKarstThree.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNilesToKarstFour
Indeed! Were it up to me, you would be forever at my side, like a loyal and adoring pup.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - SelectionBanterNilesToKarstFour.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNilesToIsla
Ah, Isla, our woman of science! It's the young ones that are wrong, not we.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - SelectionBanterNilesToIsla.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNilesToIslaTwo
The same thing I always rant about, my dear.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - SelectionBanterNilesToIslaTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNilesToIslaThree
Your machine is broken, and so are you!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - SelectionBanterNilesToIslaThree.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterIslaNilesReply
We've met a hundred times. We've gone on heists together.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - SelectionBanterIslaNilesReply.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterIslaNilesReplyTwo
Your thoughts... how vile! That is not how it works!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - SelectionBanterIslaNilesReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterIslaNilesReplyThree
You stay away from me, witch!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - SelectionBanterIslaNilesReplyThree.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterNilesToIsla
No useless prayers today. I put my faith in science!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - EntryBanterNilesToIsla.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterNilesToIslaTwo
Oh. Well that's refreshing.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - EntryBanterNilesToIslaTwo.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterNilesReply
There's torture, and then there's nightmare. You are a demon with a pleasant smile.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - EntryBanterNilesReply.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterNilesReplyTwo
That wasn't a compliment!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - EntryBanterNilesReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterNilesToIsla
I... I really thought we were going to cash in our Markers on that one.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - ExitBanterNilesToIsla.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterNilesToIslaTwo
How was that according to plan?
![[Niles, the Interrogator - ExitBanterNilesToIslaTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterNilesToIslaThree
Wasn't terrified...
![[Niles, the Interrogator - ExitBanterNilesToIslaThree.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterIslaNilesReply
Can you do that without drills?
![[Niles, the Interrogator - ExitBanterIslaNilesReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterIslaNilesReplyTwo
That does sound safer.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - ExitBanterIslaNilesReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterGiannaNilesReply
Speaking of, would you care to accompany on a date, Gianna?
![[Niles, the Interrogator - EntryBanterGiannaNilesReply.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterNilesToGianna
If harm comes to you, Gianna, I will hold myself responsible.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - EntryBanterNilesToGianna.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterGiannaNilesReply
Here! Yes, hello Gianna.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - ExitBanterGiannaNilesReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterNilesToGiana
At last. So how about that Date, Gianna?
![[Niles, the Interrogator - ExitBanterNilesToGiana.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNilesToGiannaThree
Ah, the thespian.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - SelectionBanterNilesToGiannaThree.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNilesToGiannaFour
Wonderful. Just wonderful. And yourself? Wait, no, let me try to guess. I see... shoes. Boots. Steel toed. You wish to go hiking.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - SelectionBanterNilesToGiannaFour.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNilesToGiannaFive
Well they're moving. Swiftly.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - SelectionBanterNilesToGiannaFive.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNilesToGiannaSix
They're striking... some trousers. Black. Right in the in-seam. Over and over.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - SelectionBanterNilesToGiannaSix.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNilesToGiannaSeven
Yes. A vivid imagination. Just wonderful.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - SelectionBanterNilesToGiannaSeven.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNilesToGianna
I'm needed? Oh, lady Gianna, what an incomparable pleasure.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - SelectionBanterNilesToGianna.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNilesToGiannaTwo
My Oriathan rose, my shimmering jewel among the rhoa dung.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - SelectionBanterNilesToGiannaTwo.ogg]]

Not including you, madam.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - SelectionBanterNilesToKurai.ogg]]

So be it.

#### EntryBanterVinderiNilesReply
Do you not?
![[Niles, the Interrogator - EntryBanterVinderiNilesReply.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterNilesToVinderi
Perhaps we should take mental fortitude into consideration for future expeditions.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - EntryBanterNilesToVinderi.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterNilesToVinderiTwo
Oh, I stand by what I said.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - EntryBanterNilesToVinderiTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterVinderiNilesReply
Even if the gods did exist, which they don't, do you think they would care to hear your dull opines?
![[Niles, the Interrogator - ExitBanterVinderiNilesReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterVinderiNilesReplyTwo
Oh, I'd love to see you try.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - ExitBanterVinderiNilesReplyTwo.ogg]]

Humanity triumphs where the divine dare not tread.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - ExitBanterNilesToVinderi.ogg]]

Precisely.

Yes, Vinderi, it is I.

Let us put our differences aside. The job comes first.

You know it was. I know you know it was.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - SelectionBanterNilesToVinderiTwo.ogg]]

Or else what, old man?
![[Niles, the Interrogator - SelectionBanterNilesToVinderiThree.ogg]]

...good... GOD... What--...No! Vile! What monster pictures such a thing.

Ah, the Faridun.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - SelectionBanterNilesToNenet.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNilesToNenetTwo
Out of curiosity, pariah, do the Faridun worship any gods?

You. I like you.

How come you and I never just talk?

That's my job.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - EntryBanterHuckNilesReply.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterNilesToHuck
As we stride headlong into mortal peril, remember: on the other side of death is nothing. You will simply no longer be.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - EntryBanterNilesToHuck.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterHuckNilesReply
You minimise our actions. Nothing is blessed or cursed. We just did a good job.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - ExitBanterHuckNilesReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterNilesToHuck
I worry I shall grow bored of success.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - ExitBanterNilesToHuck.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterHuckNilesReply
Oh yes. Violence, robbery... Nothing you're unaccustomed to, blackguard.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - SelectionBanterHuckNilesReply.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterHuckNilesReplyTwo
It is nothing to be ashamed of! Just as being an effective interrogator for the high templar himself is nothing to be ashamed of.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - SelectionBanterHuckNilesReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterHuckNilesReplyThree
Far from it. It means we are capable of carrying out orders, no matter how immoral.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - SelectionBanterHuckNilesReplyThree.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNilesToHuck
I knew I would be required.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - SelectionBanterNilesToHuck.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterNilesToHuckTwo
No, my friend. Merely confidence. The idea that one can see events yet to unfold is a flight of fancy akin to that of divine intervention, spontaneous generation, or medicine. We are born, we live, we get a small cut, we die, and we are gone. That is how it has always been, and that is how it will always be.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - SelectionBanterNilesToHuckTwo.ogg]]

#### Introduction
The name's Niles. I'm the resident thought extractor. Not got much to say to you just yet. Still uncertain whether I interrogated you before the Templars exiled you. Would put us quite at odds, wouldn't it? But I interrogated so many, I hardly remember their faces anymore. If I don't remember you, it probably means you broke easily...
![[Niles, the Interrogator - Introduction.ogg]]

#### The Boss
I know a thing or two about figureheads using mystery to evoke faith. It's how they deceive the masses, you see. One can never find fault with a god if one never meets him! Who, then, spreads all these tales? A Karui told me that Tukohama cut Kitava's face with a tooth. I asked him, how do you know about it if you weren't there for it? So, he stabbed me. That's what you'll get if you start asking around about the Boss. A stabbing. Only - unlike Karui - this knife won't come from the front.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - The Boss.ogg]]

#### Rational Tools
Ah yes, Exile, I was hoping you would aid me. I have a very simple mission: to prove that gods do not exist. Yes, yes, I know that you believe you have faced them yourself, but I am intent on proving the fraud. You are a victim, like many, of an elaborate facade painted for you by clever con artists. In order to expose them, I shall need a certain piece of equipment, the Thought Extractor. Forced confessions shall save us from mysticism! Are you ready to see the light?
![[Niles, the Interrogator - Rational Tools.ogg]]

#### Rational Tools_2
I immediately performed my tests with the device we stole, of course, but the random people I accosted with the Thought Extractor truly believed divinity is real. I don't know what else I expected. Instead of finding the truth, all we did was dig up the false narrative they hold dear. In order for this plan to work, we would have to force confessions out of the ones responsible for the divine facade, but if we knew who they were, then we wouldn't need their confessions! The Thought Extractor is useless! We shall continue our search for the truth some other way.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - Rational Tools_2.ogg]]

#### A Mundane Sample
Interrogation is a flawed art, as we learned together, but now I know of a better method to prove that divinity is false. I have learned the location of a renowned Azmeri artefact known as Viridi's Finger. It supposedly causes enormous plants to grow from almost any soil. Once it is in our possession, we can prove once and for all that Viridi's Finger is a fake and expose the liars for what they are. Prepare yourself, Exile!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - A Mundane Sample.ogg]]

#### A Mundane Sample_2
Hmm. Viridi's Finger did indeed cause enormous plants to grow. You know what that means, don't you? We've fallen into one of their traps. Clearly, someone has created this to fool us. I don't know whether it is some unknown species of plant, or some sort of hypnotizer, or perhaps some sort of illusion machine, but Viridi's Finger is too dangerous. I shall destroy it, so that no one else will ever be fooled by it again!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - A Mundane Sample_2.ogg]]

#### The Truth
It seems only I am privy to the truth of this world. Innocence doesn't exist, Sin doesn't exist, and the Templar faith is a lie. You can tell them I said so. I'll go down shouting it! And the Karui and Maraketh gods are probably fake, too. It's all a scam, you see. A convenient belief system to keep the rabble in check. The Karui way, Maraketh tradition, the Templars' militant faith, and the Azmeri well, they're fine actually. Inoffensive. You won't catch me living in the forest, though.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - The Truth.ogg]]

#### Godslayer
I don't know how you convinced a city full of people that you slew some sort of rampaging god, but I've seen artists' depictions of Kitava's supposed rampage. There is no way that the ground could support a being that large. Did you see the footprints? Clearly fake, carved by Templar artisans to deceive the populace. The river of blood was accomplished with diluted crimson mud from the Plains of Vastiri. It's really quite simple when you think about it. As for your own experience, there are records of gasses seeping from the crypts that once caused a whole village to believe they were fish. They flopped on the ground, gasping for air. They even died! Have you considered you may be a victim of a similar occurrence?
![[Niles, the Interrogator - Godslayer.ogg]]

#### The Outer Realms
When I was younger, I served next to some very powerful men. I once caught a stray thought from the High Templar Venarius. A simple picture, nothing more, possible to perceive only because of his overwhelming fear at that moment. I have to assume he was insane, because the image he had in mind was that of a single beleaguered jewel adrift on an ocean of madness. If that was how I saw the world, it would almost be a comfort to believe in gods. At least then there would be somebody who could stand against the tide... but even then... against what I saw... Just an old man's idle fears. Pay no mind.

#### NilesDeceptionLongThree
Just another form of mind control.

#### NilesBusyAlarmOne
Buzz off, pest!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesBusyAlarmOne.ogg]]

#### NilesBusyAlarmTwo
Not now!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesBusyAlarmTwo.ogg]]

#### NilesBusyAlarmThree
I'm focusing!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesBusyAlarmThree.ogg]]

#### NilesBusyAlarmFour
Quit pestering me!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesBusyAlarmFour.ogg]]

#### NilesBusyAlarmFive
Grrrr!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesBusyAlarmFive.ogg]]

#### NilesInterruptedOne
Heretics!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesInterruptedOne.ogg]]

#### NilesInterruptedTwo
Infidels!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesInterruptedTwo.ogg]]

#### NilesInterruptedThree
That hurt!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesInterruptedThree.ogg]]

#### NilesInterruptedFour
Hey, stop it!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesInterruptedFour.ogg]]

#### NilesInterruptedAlarmOne
Yeowch!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesInterruptedAlarmOne.ogg]]

#### NilesInterruptedAlarmTwo
Exile, save me!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesInterruptedAlarmTwo.ogg]]

#### NilesInterruptedAlarmThree
I'm bleeding!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesInterruptedAlarmThree.ogg]]

#### NilesInterruptedAlarmFour
Stabbed AGAIN?
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesInterruptedAlarmFour.ogg]]

#### NilesInterruptedAlarmFive
I {need} to {focus}!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesInterruptedAlarmFive.ogg]]

#### NilesCombatStartOne
Commence the bloody work.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesCombatStartOne.ogg]]

#### NilesCombatStartTwo
Time for a tussle.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesCombatStartTwo.ogg]]

#### NilesCombatStartThree
Torture quickened counts as combat.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesCombatStartThree.ogg]]

#### NilesCombatStartFour
You can handle this, yes?
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesCombatStartFour.ogg]]

#### NilesCombatStartFive
I really don't want to get stabbed again.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesCombatStartFive.ogg]]

#### NilesCombatStartAlarmOne
You have chosen death!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesCombatStartAlarmOne.ogg]]

#### NilesCombatStartAlarmTwo
I refuse to die here!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesCombatStartAlarmTwo.ogg]]

#### NilesCombatStartAlarmThree
To battle!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesCombatStartAlarmThree.ogg]]

#### NilesCombatStartAlarmFour
Clash of arms!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesCombatStartAlarmFour.ogg]]

#### NilesCombatStartAlarmFive
Not today!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesCombatStartAlarmFive.ogg]]

#### NilesCombatEndOne
Mortal strength carries the day.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesCombatEndOne.ogg]]

#### NilesCombatEndTwo
Glad you're on my side.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesCombatEndTwo.ogg]]

#### NilesCombatEndThree
No afterlife for them. A shame.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesCombatEndThree.ogg]]

#### NilesCombatEndFour
Thank God we survived. Wait, I didn't mean that!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesCombatEndFour.ogg]]

#### NilesCombatEndFive
I didn't get stabbed?
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesCombatEndFive.ogg]]

#### NilesCombatEndSix
Well, glad that's over.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesCombatEndSix.ogg]]

#### NilesCombatEndSeven
All this gore reminds me of home.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesCombatEndSeven.ogg]]

#### NilesCombatEndAlarmOne
Keep going! Run!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesCombatEndAlarmOne.ogg]]

#### NilesCombatEndAlarmTwo
We can't stop now!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesCombatEndAlarmTwo.ogg]]

#### NilesCombatEndAlarmThree
What next?!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesCombatEndAlarmThree.ogg]]

#### NilesCombatEndAlarmFour
It would seem our luck has not yet run out!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesCombatEndAlarmFour.ogg]]

#### NilesCombatEndAlarmFive
Absolutely brutal.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesCombatEndAlarmFive.ogg]]

#### NilesLootOne
Lovely. Just lovely.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesLootOne.ogg]]

#### NilesLootTwo
Don't you owe me a few markers?
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesLootTwo.ogg]]

#### NilesLootThree
Avarice is not entirely without merit.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesLootThree.ogg]]

#### NilesLootFour
Not all treasure is silver and gold.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesLootFour.ogg]]

#### NilesLootFive
I'm unimpressed.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesLootFive.ogg]]

#### NilesLootAlarmOne
Leave it, there are more important matters!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesLootAlarmOne.ogg]]

#### NilesLootAlarmTwo
Are you seriously doing that right now?
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesLootAlarmTwo.ogg]]

#### NilesLootAlarmThree
Your avarice knows no bounds!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesLootAlarmThree.ogg]]

#### NilesLootAlarmFour
Pecuniary sloth!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesLootAlarmFour.ogg]]

#### NilesLootAlarmFive
Quit wasting time!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesLootAlarmFive.ogg]]

#### NilesAlertOne
You do know we're about to get caught?
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesAlertOne.ogg]]

#### NilesAlertTwo
I sense suspicion. They may be on to us.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesAlertTwo.ogg]]

#### NilesAlertThree
To err is human, but one more mistake and we'll be ruined.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesAlertThree.ogg]]

#### NilesAlertFour
They're about to notice us.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesAlertFour.ogg]]

#### NilesAlarmTriggeredOne
Time to go, I take it?
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesAlarmTriggeredOne.ogg]]

#### NilesAlarmTriggeredTwo
This was part of the plan, right?
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesAlarmTriggeredTwo.ogg]]

#### NilesAlarmTriggeredThree
Was that supposed to happen?
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesAlarmTriggeredThree.ogg]]

#### NilesAlarmTriggeredEarlyOne
Drat.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesAlarmTriggeredEarlyOne.ogg]]

#### NilesAlarmTriggeredEarlyTwo
Flee!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesAlarmTriggeredEarlyTwo.ogg]]

#### NilesAlarmTriggeredEarlyThree
You've done it now!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesAlarmTriggeredEarlyThree.ogg]]

#### NilesFinalRoomOne
The inner sanctum...
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesFinalRoomOne.ogg]]

#### NilesFinalRoomTwo
Do what you must.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesFinalRoomTwo.ogg]]

#### NilesFinalRoomThree
I half expected us not to make it this far.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesFinalRoomThree.ogg]]

#### NilesFinalRoomFour
There may be traps. You go first.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesFinalRoomFour.ogg]]

#### NilesFinalRoomFive
Time to make an acquisition.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesFinalRoomFive.ogg]]

#### NilesFinalRoomAlarmOne
Hurry!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesFinalRoomAlarmOne.ogg]]

#### NilesFinalRoomAlarmTwo
Don't waste time!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesFinalRoomAlarmTwo.ogg]]

#### NilesFinalRoomAlarmThree
Move like your life depends upon it!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesFinalRoomAlarmThree.ogg]]

#### NilesFinalRoomAlarmFour
What are you waiting for?!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesFinalRoomAlarmFour.ogg]]

#### NilesFinalRoomAlarmFive
Go get it!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesFinalRoomAlarmFive.ogg]]

#### NilesObjectiveOne
You've got it!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesObjectiveOne.ogg]]

#### NilesObjectiveTwo
And without any divine aid!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesObjectiveTwo.ogg]]

#### NilesObjectiveThree
Alright, then. We have it.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesObjectiveThree.ogg]]

#### NilesObjectiveFour
Good, very good.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesObjectiveFour.ogg]]

#### NilesObjectiveAlarmOne
Let's hope it's not too late!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesObjectiveAlarmOne.ogg]]

#### NilesObjectiveAlarmTwo
Where's the exit?!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesObjectiveAlarmTwo.ogg]]

#### NilesObjectiveAlarmThree
Let's find Adiyah!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesObjectiveAlarmThree.ogg]]

#### NilesObjectiveAlarmFour
There must be some kind of way out of here!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesObjectiveAlarmFour.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterKuraiNilesReply
Another ill-advised plan?
![[Niles, the Interrogator - SelectionBanterKuraiNilesReply.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterKuraiNilesReplyTwo
Then I assume I'll get stabbed again.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - SelectionBanterKuraiNilesReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterKuraiNilesReplyThree
Yes, yes...
![[Niles, the Interrogator - SelectionBanterKuraiNilesReplyThree.ogg]]

#### NilesEntryBanterOne
You handle the killing, and we'll do just fine.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesEntryBanterOne.ogg]]

#### NilesEntryBanterTwo
Mortal planning is all we have. There is no fate.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesEntryBanterTwo.ogg]]

#### NilesEntryBanterThree
This will go as well as all our other misadventures.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesEntryBanterThree.ogg]]

#### NilesEntryBanterFour
I have a bad feeling about this one.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesEntryBanterFour.ogg]]

#### NilesEntryBanterFive
I sense a violent intent. Good, very good.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesEntryBanterFive.ogg]]

#### NilesExitBanterOne
That made me nostalgic for my interrogator days.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesExitBanterOne.ogg]]

#### NilesExitBanterTwo
Hah! I survived! A great many betting rogues just lost a great many markers.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesExitBanterTwo.ogg]]

#### NilesExitBanterThree
I'm going to sleep in tomorrow. I've earned it.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesExitBanterThree.ogg]]

#### NilesExitBanterFour
Nothing quite like the thrill of avoiding death one more day!
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesExitBanterFour.ogg]]

#### NilesExitBanterFive
It's time for some mead.
![[Niles, the Interrogator - NilesExitBanterFive.ogg]]
