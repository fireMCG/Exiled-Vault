## Janus Perandus Dialogue
#### JanusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightZero
Witness the start of a new world order!
![[Janus Perandus - JanusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightZero.ogg]]

#### JanusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightOne
Meddler! Leave this place or perish.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightOne.ogg]]

#### JanusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwo
You would assault our goods? Barbaric!
![[Janus Perandus - JanusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwo.ogg]]

#### JanusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThree
Did you wish to join the other corpses, Exile?
![[Janus Perandus - JanusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThree.ogg]]

#### JanusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFour
Don't make this harder than it has to be.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFour.ogg]]

#### JanusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFive
To think I just finished washing out the stench of prison.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFive.ogg]]

#### JanusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSix
Our dirty little deal is over, Exile.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSix.ogg]]

#### JanusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSeven
Think I feel bad about what I did? Please.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSeven.ogg]]

#### JanusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEight
I've long wanted to see how futile your cause truly is.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEight.ogg]]

#### JanusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightNine
Back for more? How wonderful.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightNine.ogg]]

#### JanusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTen
A Perandus is never alone.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTen.ogg]]

#### JanusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEleven
Behold my machinery at maximum efficiency.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEleven.ogg]]

#### JanusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwelve
There is no avoiding your fate, Exile.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwelve.ogg]]

#### JanusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThirteen
Relentless.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThirteen.ogg]]

#### JanusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFourteen
I only have to hit you with this once...
![[Janus Perandus - JanusPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFourteen.ogg]]

#### JanusSafehouseLeaderIntroZero
Trespassing is a crime, and criminals must be punished.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusSafehouseLeaderIntroZero.ogg]]

#### JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero
This property belongs to the Perandus, interloper! And the Syndicate.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero.ogg]]

#### JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne
How dare you attack my... our path to wealth.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne.ogg]]

#### JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo
What a dreadful mess.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo.ogg]]

#### JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree
This was meant to be done by now!
![[Janus Perandus - JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree.ogg]]

#### JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour
Gods, boredom will drive a man to do just about anything.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour.ogg]]

#### JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive
These grounds do not belong to you!
![[Janus Perandus - JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive.ogg]]

#### JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix
I've come to rescue you, savage. Thank me later.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix.ogg]]

#### JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven
Tora, your mark still walks. This is a problem!
![[Janus Perandus - JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven.ogg]]

#### JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight
You debauched overgrown toddler! Why does the Exile yet live?
![[Janus Perandus - JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight.ogg]]

#### JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine
I shouldn't have to do your job for you, assassin.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine.ogg]]

#### JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTen
Here we are, Thane, fighting side by side, just as our ancestors did in the Labyrinth.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTen.ogg]]

#### JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalEleven
Typical. Just typical! Try not to cock this up.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalEleven.ogg]]

#### JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwelve
Our territory needs better management.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwelve.ogg]]

#### JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirteen
This transport needs to be... redirected.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirteen.ogg]]

#### JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalFourteen
Such is my disdain for you, that I came down here.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalFourteen.ogg]]

#### JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalFifteen
Bad news, I'm afraid. The Exile's no longer the primary target.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalFifteen.ogg]]

#### JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalSixteen
I respect your conviction, Elreon, but our goals are at odds.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalSixteen.ogg]]

#### JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeventeen
Sorry, Guff, but you're out. Too untrustworthy.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeventeen.ogg]]

#### JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalEighteen
You're braindead, Hillock. It's time your body caught up.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalEighteen.ogg]]

#### JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalNineteen
Gravicius, let me remind you just what the Perandus name means.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalNineteen.ogg]]

#### JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwenty
Shame you can't go back to Ogham, Ezomyte. You don't belong here.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwenty.ogg]]

#### JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyOne
I'm quite sorry, but the political landscape has changed.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyOne.ogg]]

#### JanusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero
You moron. You should be defending me!
![[Janus Perandus - JanusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero.ogg]]

#### JanusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne
When the Lifegiver hears about this, you're done.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne.ogg]]

#### JanusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo
Fine. We'll handle your corpse, too.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo.ogg]]

#### JanusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree
This was supposed to be quick and easy.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree.ogg]]

#### JanusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour
I'm more than happy to defend my family's name. Try me.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour.ogg]]

#### JanusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive
What? We're on the same team!
![[Janus Perandus - JanusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive.ogg]]

#### JanusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix
Please don't splash whatever it is you're dripping with on me.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix.ogg]]

#### JanusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven
Then perhaps you should do something that will help me remember your name.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven.ogg]]

#### JanusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight
You I can handle myself.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight.ogg]]

#### JanusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine
You should know better than to stand in the way of a Perandus.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine.ogg]]

#### JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyTwo
A Perandus never abandons good land.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyTwo.ogg]]

#### JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyThree
We lose the carts, you lose your head.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyThree.ogg]]

#### JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFour
Someone has some explaining to do.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFour.ogg]]

#### JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFive
How do you mess an ambush up this badly?
![[Janus Perandus - JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFive.ogg]]

#### JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySix
Do as I say, Karui, and we can keep the Eternal One out of this.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySix.ogg]]

#### JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySeven
If my robes get ruined, Tora, you're squarely to blame.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySeven.ogg]]

#### JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyEight
The Brotherhood of Silence has always served my family well.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyEight.ogg]]

#### JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyNine
Simple Hillock, all you had to do was bash what I said.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyNine.ogg]]

#### JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirty
Gravicius! You're the Sentari to my Chitus. You know what to do!
![[Janus Perandus - JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirty.ogg]]

#### JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirtyOne
You know how this goes. Do what you're told and you'll be rewarded.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirtyOne.ogg]]

#### JanusKillPlayerZero
Well, it wasn't like you were ever going to win.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusKillPlayerZero.ogg]]

#### JanusKillPlayerOne
Nobody touches a Perandus' wealth.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusKillPlayerOne.ogg]]

#### JanusKillPlayerTwo
Wonderful. Can we hurry this up?
![[Janus Perandus - JanusKillPlayerTwo.ogg]]

#### JanusKillPlayerThree
I did it! All by myself...!
![[Janus Perandus - JanusKillPlayerThree.ogg]]

#### JanusEscapeZero
Remember this kindness, Exile.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusEscapeZero.ogg]]

#### JanusEscapeOne
My growing wealth remains secure.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusEscapeOne.ogg]]

#### JanusEscapeTwo
Time's up, and you've got nothing to show for it.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusEscapeTwo.ogg]]

#### JanusDefeatedZero
No... I needed... this land...
![[Janus Perandus - JanusDefeatedZero.ogg]]

#### JanusDefeatedOne
My... cargo...
![[Janus Perandus - JanusDefeatedOne.ogg]]

#### JanusDefeatedTwo
This... is not good...
![[Janus Perandus - JanusDefeatedTwo.ogg]]

#### JanusDefeatedThree
Mortifying.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusDefeatedThree.ogg]]

#### JanusDefeatedFour
No more cells... you have to promise me...
![[Janus Perandus - JanusDefeatedFour.ogg]]

#### JanusDefeatedFive
You win... let's parlay.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusDefeatedFive.ogg]]

#### JanusDefeatedSix
To think... I worked with you...
![[Janus Perandus - JanusDefeatedSix.ogg]]

#### JanusDefeatedSeven
Wait, let me think...!
![[Janus Perandus - JanusDefeatedSeven.ogg]]

#### JanusDefeatedEight
I've never been so embarrassed.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusDefeatedEight.ogg]]

#### JanusDefeatedNine
What an absolute shambles.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusDefeatedNine.ogg]]

#### JanusDefeatedTen
You... went for the wrong person, Exile...
![[Janus Perandus - JanusDefeatedTen.ogg]]

#### JanusOfferBargainZero
That was vivid. I see you're not one to bluff. Well, I'm not one to gamble. Okay, that - that's a lie, I love gambling, but not with my life. So, go on, what are you after?
![[Janus Perandus - JanusOfferBargainZero.ogg]]

#### JanusOfferBargainOne
A man of status has a way of bringing others up to his level, and what higher status is there than that of a Perandus? Yes, we're at odds, but consider, really consider, the benefits to you of not just having one but two men on the inside. One of them could even be a woman!
![[Janus Perandus - JanusOfferBargainOne.ogg]]

#### JanusOfferBargainTwo
If you cut a Perandus, and you definitely should not do so, but if you do, we bleed diplomacy. Don't - don't test it. It's a metaphor. Put the knife away, and allow me to do what I was born to do: exchange information. If I whisper into the ear of a cohort, they will whisper into mine. And if you should overhear such whispers? Well, there's simply nothing I could do about that!
![[Janus Perandus - JanusOfferBargainTwo.ogg]]

#### JanusOfferBargainThree
This work? This is grunt work. Look at me. Do I look like a grunt to you? Don't answer that. I didn't want to be doing this any more than you wanted me to. In fact, there's a job I've had my eye on for some time that I think you'll agree is much more suitable for a man of my stature.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusOfferBargainThree.ogg]]

#### JanusOfferBargainFour
The Syndicate is wonderful. It really is. If you weren't trying to kill all of us, I'd suggest you try it. Except I fear there's no more room... hmm... I know! I'll take a little leave of absence, and you can try it out for yourself! Might be tricky convincing the others, but, well, that won't really be my problem, will it?
![[Janus Perandus - JanusOfferBargainFour.ogg]]

#### JanusOfferBargainFive
My family name was once synonymous with intelligence, both of the mind, and of the... what's that ...thing called... espionage! Yes. Well, times may have changed, but we haven't. In exchange for keeping my lovely blood where it's meant to be, how about I tell you a few things you might find meaningful.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusOfferBargainFive.ogg]]

#### JanusOfferBargainSix
The Perandus family is not quite the goldmine it once was, but I myself am not entirely without items of value. Nothing is more valuable than the wonderful sound of my own beating heart, of course, so how about a good old fashioned pay-off?
![[Janus Perandus - JanusOfferBargainSix.ogg]]

#### JanusBargainAcceptedZero
Not the one I'd have chosen, but sure.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusBargainAcceptedZero.ogg]]

#### JanusBargainAcceptedOne
Thank you. Please put the knife down now.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusBargainAcceptedOne.ogg]]

#### JanusBargainAcceptedTwo
Ah, nobleman's work. Lovely!
![[Janus Perandus - JanusBargainAcceptedTwo.ogg]]

#### JanusBargainAcceptedThree
Just tell them I said it's fine for you to join. I'm quite popular. They may still try and attack you on sight, but can you really blame them?
![[Janus Perandus - JanusBargainAcceptedThree.ogg]]

#### JanusBargainAcceptedFour
Time to espionagerate. Espionify? Espi - time to talk!
![[Janus Perandus - JanusBargainAcceptedFour.ogg]]

#### JanusBargainAcceptedFive
Yes, yes... if anyone asks where you got such wondrous gifts, well, tell them it was me. Need to keep up appearances.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusBargainAcceptedFive.ogg]]

#### JanusOfferBetrayalZero
Oh Janus, you've really done it this time! Look at the situation you've got yourself in. You're an employee! Listen here, Exile. This whole organisation is flipped on its head. I should be running the thing! In fact... how about you let me go, and I put my silly little boss here in a more suitable role, and I take the plinth I was born to take.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusOfferBetrayalZero.ogg]]

#### JanusOfferBetrayalOne
Do you know how my family got to be so wealthy so long ago? Blackmail. Probably blackmail. It was... wait, was it? Actually, I'm not sure. I should check that, but I really think it was very likely blackmail. Anyway, I have a truly shocking amount of dirt on everyone here. Let me go, and I'll turn the Syndicate headquarters into a field... because of all the dirt.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusOfferBetrayalOne.ogg]]

#### JanusOfferBetrayalTwo
If there's one thing I simply can't stand, it's dying. I'd do almost anything to avoid it. I'd go so far as to kill someone! Or get someone to kill someone on my behalf, anyway. Not overly fond of blood. Let me go, and I'll get the ol' ball rolling on that murder.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusOfferBetrayalTwo.ogg]]

#### JanusOfferBetrayalThree
I love a bit of gossip, don't you? Who's rutting whom, who's been swiping gold from the coffers - me - who's been planning what where within the Syndicate... you know... gossip! Can't gossip if you're dead though. That is one of many things you cannot do when you're dead.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusOfferBetrayalThree.ogg]]

#### JanusOfferBetrayalFour
Haku is incorruptible, and that makes him extremely dangerous in a world of compromises and grey outcomes.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusOfferBetrayalFour.ogg]]

#### JanusOfferBetrayalFive
Leo's the kind of scrappy fighter who just won't give up. It's as impressive as it is dangerous. A clever individual like yourself would take any opportunity to force him to give in, I'm sure.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusOfferBetrayalFive.ogg]]

#### JanusOfferBetrayalSix
How often do you find yourself with an assassin from the Brotherhood of Silence at your whim? If you don't take advantage of such an opportunity, well, I simply can't be held responsible for whatever viciously sharp object ends up in your spine later.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusOfferBetrayalSix.ogg]]

#### JanusOfferBetrayalSeven
Look, Guff's a nice guy, for a pirate. Have you ever met a nice pirate? A pirate who wasn't just waiting to 'plunder' the old 'booty' as they say? I certainly haven't.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusOfferBetrayalSeven.ogg]]

#### JanusOfferBetrayalEight
General Gravicius still demands that we call him General. Anyone who cares that much about status makes my Perandus blood boil over. Please, show him just how much his rank is worth.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusOfferBetrayalEight.ogg]]

#### JanusOfferBetrayalNine
Yes, I'm a Perandus, but how much does that really mean anymore? Other Immortal Syndicate members are far more dangerous. I'm just charming.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusOfferBetrayalNine.ogg]]

#### JanusOfferExecuteZero
I really do hate the idea of dying, but... oh, go on then. Get it over with.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusOfferExecuteZero.ogg]]

#### JanusOfferExecuteOne
A good nobleman will always die for their king or queen. Or boss.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusOfferExecuteOne.ogg]]

#### JanusOfferExecuteTwo
I never thought I'd put my life before that of a friend, but here we are.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusOfferExecuteTwo.ogg]]

#### JanusOfferExecuteThree
No. I will not go back to the cells. I refuse. You'll have to kill me. I'm serious.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusOfferExecuteThree.ogg]]

#### JanusReplyToBetrayalAcceptedZero
Ha! Brilliant. Awful, really awful for me in particular, but brilliant.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusReplyToBetrayalAcceptedZero.ogg]]

#### JanusReplyToBetrayalAcceptedOne
Sometimes I wonder if my last name is a blessing or a curse.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusReplyToBetrayalAcceptedOne.ogg]]

#### JanusReplyToBetrayalAcceptedTwo
Religion is for fools, holy man. At least power is real.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusReplyToBetrayalAcceptedTwo.ogg]]

#### JanusReplyToBetrayalAcceptedThree
What? I'm innocent! Other than - oh.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusReplyToBetrayalAcceptedThree.ogg]]

#### JanusReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFour
I'd rather be a pathetic excuse for a man, Gravicius, than the monster you are.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFour.ogg]]

#### JanusReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFive
Old grudges die hard, I guess. The brothers of Thanes, on the other hand...
![[Janus Perandus - JanusReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFive.ogg]]

#### JanusReplyToBetrayalAcceptedSix
You'll regret this. A Perandus always, always comes out on top.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusReplyToBetrayalAcceptedSix.ogg]]

#### JanusInterrogatedZero
Time to see how the paupers live I s'pose.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusInterrogatedZero.ogg]]

#### JanusInterrogatedOne
Absolutely not. No. No! Damn you, no!
![[Janus Perandus - JanusInterrogatedOne.ogg]]

#### JanusInterrogatedTwo
What? Not even going to try to make another deal?
![[Janus Perandus - JanusInterrogatedTwo.ogg]]

#### JanusReplyToExecutionZero
Gruesome.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusReplyToExecutionZero.ogg]]

#### JanusReplyToExecutionOne
That was really, really, really, really mean.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusReplyToExecutionOne.ogg]]

#### JanusReplyToExecutionTwo
Yuck! Damn. I got some on me.
![[Janus Perandus - JanusReplyToExecutionTwo.ogg]]

#### JanusSafehouseLeaderDefeatedZero
You... shouldn't even be here! This shouldn't be allowed!
![[Janus Perandus - JanusSafehouseLeaderDefeatedZero.ogg]]
