## Ranger - PoE1 Dialogue
#### Ranger1
I've not seen a wilderness like this before. There'll be some dark days ahead.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger1.ogg]]

#### Ranger2
There's no justice in a place like this. Only misery.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger2.ogg]]

#### Ranger3
I've done for you what I would do for any wounded animal, Brutus.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger3.ogg]]

#### Ranger4
Life and death live side by side. This is a strange land.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger4.ogg]]

#### Ranger5
You were a good man in a bad situation, Fairgraves.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger5.ogg]]

#### Ranger6
Your love for a man... that's what did this to you, Merveil.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger6.ogg]]

#### Ranger7
Do some good for once in your sorry life, bandit. Feed the worms.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger7.ogg]]

#### Ranger8
The king of rats? A feast for rats now.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger8.ogg]]

#### Ranger9
I hate to pluck a pretty flower. Even a poisonous one like you.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger9.ogg]]

#### Ranger10
Luxury and cruelty go hand in hand.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger10.ogg]]

#### Ranger11
This shouldn't be happening. Not in the world I know.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger11.ogg]]

#### Ranger12
Spread the word amongst your kind, nightmare. You're not welcome in my world.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger12.ogg]]

#### Ranger13
Life is nothing without death. That simple truth's been forgotten from time to time.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger13.ogg]]

#### Ranger14
I've never felt further from what I know and love.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger14.ogg]]

#### Ranger15
Piety... you've so much to answer for.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger15.ogg]]

#### Ranger16
Without men like you, Gravicius, this land might just start healing itself.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger16.ogg]]

#### Ranger17
Your death doesn't fix anything, Piety. But at least it won't get any worse.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger17.ogg]]

#### Ranger18
Why do we insist on building mountains? Why not just go and climb them?
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger18.ogg]]

#### Ranger19
Some of us live to regret our mistakes. Some of us don't. Try not to take it personally.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger19.ogg]]

#### Ranger20
Cities are a blight upon nature, and Sarn was the foulest of them all.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger20.ogg]]

#### Ranger21
A lake drained, a million creatures lost, just so Sarn could keep its privies flowing.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger21.ogg]]

#### Ranger22
This land won't miss your kind, Voll.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger22.ogg]]

#### Ranger23
That's no natural earthquake.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger23.ogg]]

#### Ranger24
Feels like something stirring in its sleep.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger24.ogg]]

#### Ranger25
My gift, from one fighting woman to another, Deshret.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger25.ogg]]

#### Ranger26
This is one deeply troubled mountain.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger26.ogg]]

#### Ranger27
The only love you had, Daresso, was for yourself.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger27.ogg]]

#### Ranger28
This isn't the Karui that I know.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger28.ogg]]

#### Ranger29
One less little, angry boy for the world to deal with.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger29.ogg]]

#### Ranger30
So this is what life inside of a nightmare looks like.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger30.ogg]]

#### Ranger31
Every crime against nature imaginable.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger31.ogg]]

#### Ranger32
Your kind leave nothing but scars, Maligaro.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger32.ogg]]

#### Ranger33
We destroy so much beauty in our pursuit of 'prettiness'.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger33.ogg]]

#### Ranger34
You were your own worst enemy, Doedre.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger34.ogg]]

#### Ranger35
Piety, you never should have resisted Death. Nature wills it, like all else.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger35.ogg]]

#### Ranger36
You were going to put to death the world that I love. Do you really think I would let you and your Beast do that, Malachai?
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger36.ogg]]

#### Ranger37
I'm not up to that just yet.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger37.ogg]]

#### Ranger39
My Mana is gone.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger39.ogg]]

#### Ranger41
That would only slow me down.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger41.ogg]]

#### Ranger43
Ahhhh..that feels better.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger43.ogg]]

#### Ranger45
I'll need to toughen up for that one.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger45.ogg]]

#### Ranger47
I'm no fool, but this one's got me beat.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger47.ogg]]

#### Ranger49
I need to sharpen the reflexes before I use that.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger49.ogg]]

#### Ranger51
I have a hunch I'll be needing this.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger51.ogg]]

#### Ranger53
Can't see why I'd want to do that here.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger53.ogg]]

#### Ranger55
Beauty will grow from your remains.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger55.ogg]]

#### Ranger57
Poor, corrupted creature.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger57.ogg]]

#### Ranger59
Pruning a branch can save a tree.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger59.ogg]]

#### Ranger61
I give you to the earth.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger61.ogg]]

#### Ranger63
I put you out of your misery.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger63.ogg]]

#### Ranger65
I live and learn.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger65.ogg]]

#### Ranger66
I'm still breathing. That's a good sign.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger66.ogg]]

#### Ranger67
The worms'll have to wait a bit longer for this meal.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger67.ogg]]

#### Ranger68
Pain brings strength. That's nature for you.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger68.ogg]]

#### Ranger69
As the prey grows more fierce, so must the Huntress.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger69.ogg]]

#### Ranger70
One rung closer to the top of the food chain.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger70.ogg]]

#### Ranger71
Looks like this land and I are coming to an understanding.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger71.ogg]]

#### Ranger72
You've given me so much. What can I do for you, Wraeclast?
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Ranger72.ogg]]

#### RangerApproachResonator
Trusting my life to a machine seems unwise... but it must be done.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - RangerApproachResonator.ogg]]

#### RangerEnterSlavePens
No living being deserves to be caged.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - RangerEnterSlavePens.ogg]]

#### RangerOverseerKrowKilled
Be free! Break your cages and escape!
![[Ranger - PoE1 - RangerOverseerKrowKilled.ogg]]

#### RangerEnterA5Town
I was always a rebel. Glad others are finally seeing things my way.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - RangerEnterA5Town.ogg]]

#### RangerPickUpMiasmeter
Somehow, I doubt Piety's 'science' is going to solve our problems.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - RangerPickUpMiasmeter.ogg]]

#### RangerPickUpEyesOfZeal
He should have kept a better eye out.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - RangerPickUpEyesOfZeal.ogg]]

#### RangerEnterOriathA5
One way or another, this city is doomed.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - RangerEnterOriathA5.ogg]]

#### RangerEnterTemplarCourts
The height of civilisation... used only to oppress free will.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - RangerEnterTemplarCourts.ogg]]

#### RangerEnterChamberOfInnocence
Stained glass and gold... what exquisite lies we tell ourselves.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - RangerEnterChamberOfInnocence.ogg]]

#### RangerAnswerAvarius
Not if I have anything to say about it!
![[Ranger - PoE1 - RangerAnswerAvarius.ogg]]

#### RangerInnocenceEmerges
The pinnacle of hubris. The fall of man.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - RangerInnocenceEmerges.ogg]]

Let the hunt begin.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - RangerAfterEmergeFromSin.ogg]]

#### RangerEnterTorchedCourts
Fire is the first step toward healing.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - RangerEnterTorchedCourts.ogg]]

#### RangerEnterBurningSquare
Cities were always a form of madness. Now it's just obvious.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - RangerEnterBurningSquare.ogg]]

#### RangerKillUtula
I was happy to aid your rebellion, Utula, but not... this!
![[Ranger - PoE1 - RangerKillUtula.ogg]]

#### RangerEnterOssuary
These bones should have been returned to nature.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - RangerEnterOssuary.ogg]]

#### RangerPickUpSignOfPurity
This energy... so hauntingly familiar, from long ago...
![[Ranger - PoE1 - RangerPickUpSignOfPurity.ogg]]

#### RangerPlaceSignOfPurity
I will not let you consume this world!
![[Ranger - PoE1 - RangerPlaceSignOfPurity.ogg]]

#### RangerWalkAwayInDefeatA5
Need to hone my skills. I'll have another shot before everything's gone.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - RangerWalkAwayInDefeatA5.ogg]]

#### RangerLearnFromSin
I knew that already... somehow...
![[Ranger - PoE1 - RangerLearnFromSin.ogg]]

#### RangerEnterTwilightShoresA6
I'm not the same woman I was. Wraeclast has changed me.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - RangerEnterTwilightShoresA6.ogg]]

#### RangerEnterCoastA6
I can feel it... this land is crying out in pain.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - RangerEnterCoastA6.ogg]]

#### RangerRespondToNessa
I'll do whatever it takes to save you, Nessa.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - RangerRespondToNessa.ogg]]

#### RangerDefeatedTukohama
Nature sometimes makes mistakes. This one, I'm happy to correct.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - RangerDefeatedTukohama.ogg]]

#### RangerEnterPrisonA6
Something has taken up new residence in this place of misery.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - RangerEnterPrisonA6.ogg]]

#### RangerDefeatedShavronne
Your reliance on mindless brawn was your undoing, Shavronne.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - RangerDefeatedShavronne.ogg]]

#### RangerDefeatedAbberath
Consider me nature's vengeance, alchemist.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - RangerDefeatedAbberath.ogg]]

#### RangerDefeatedRyslatha

![[Ranger - PoE1 - RangerDefeatedRyslatha.ogg]]

#### RangerAzmeriGone
Where are the Azmeri? Who has taken their encampment?
![[Ranger - PoE1 - RangerAzmeriGone.ogg]]

#### RangerCommentOnNessaTwo
I must move quickly to save her!
![[Ranger - PoE1 - RangerCommentOnNessaTwo.ogg]]

#### RangerEnterBrineKingReef
No single being should have the power to reshape the world like this.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - RangerEnterBrineKingReef.ogg]]

#### RangerDefeatedBrineKing
Nessa... I'm sorry... I was too late...
![[Ranger - PoE1 - RangerDefeatedBrineKing.ogg]]

#### RangerPickUpMaligarosMap
Now that's a strange feeling! Best not touch it again unless I have to.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - RangerPickUpMaligarosMap.ogg]]

#### RangerEnterChamberOfSinsA7
The legacy of evil men continues to plague Wraeclast.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - RangerEnterChamberOfSinsA7.ogg]]

#### RangerEnterMaligarosSanctum
The proper feel of the world... it's absent here...
![[Ranger - PoE1 - RangerEnterMaligarosSanctum.ogg]]

#### RangerDefeatedMaligaroA7
This 'sanctum' is nothing but a scar on nature.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - RangerDefeatedMaligaroA7.ogg]]

There's still a chance these fields can heal... if I can put a stop to this.

Join your children, and find peace.

You should have asked what some spiders do to their mates, Silk.

#### RangerDefeatedTolman
The dead should stay dead. It's time to let go.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - RangerDefeatedTolman.ogg]]

Let the birds feast on the rotting corpses of those abominations. More useful that way.

#### RangerPickUpSunOrb

![[Ranger - PoE1 - RangerPickUpSunOrb.ogg]]

#### RangerPickUpMoonOrb
Cold, like the night...
![[Ranger - PoE1 - RangerPickUpMoonOrb.ogg]]

#### RangerDefeatedSolarisAndLunaris
You two could have changed the world. Instead, you let petty jealousies consume you. Pathetic.

Make use of every part of the animal, I always say.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - RangerPickUpBasiliskAcid.ogg]]

Strength is not the only power in this world.

Why do powerful men always end up thinking they're God?

Should be careful what I offer my tribute.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - RangerSeesRitual.ogg]]

#### RangerMetGwennen
I am not a 'local.'
![[Ranger - PoE1 - RangerMetGwennen.ogg]]

#### Dom_Intro_Ranger.ogg
Swift and silent you stole the bounty of others. A crow that plunders our crops. A stray dog that slaughters our sheep. Oriath is a land of men, not animals. Think on that, Ranger, when Wraeclast shows you how to truly live like an animal.
![[Ranger - PoE1 - Dom_Intro_Ranger.ogg.ogg]]
