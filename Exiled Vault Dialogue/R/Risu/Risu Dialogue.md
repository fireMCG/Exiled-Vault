## Risu Dialogue
#### Introduction
One thousand praises, my friend! I thought I would die here. Please, take me back to your caravan and I will tell you anything you want to know.

#### Identity
I am of the Faridun. You know us, tale-woman. We are your unwanted and forgotten. Some time ago, a foreign woman came to us, and offered us the power to seize what was ours. We took her deal. We had no idea what it would cost us. When she finally brought us the Beast, it was not the glorious power we'd been promised. It was horrifying. Those of us who did not want to make war, those of us who were afraid of the Beast... Jamanra sealed us in the mine when his Dreadnought was complete. This madness must end! Some may call me a traitor, but I do not seek the destruction of my brethren. I seek their salvation.

#### Identity_2
I am of the Faridun. We are the shadows of the Maraketh, the unwanted and the forgotten. Some time ago, a foreign woman came to us, and offered us the power to take back what was ours. We took her deal. We had no idea what it would cost us. When she finally brought us the Beast, it was not the glorious power we'd been promised. It was horrifying. Those of us who did not want to make war, those of us who were afraid of the Beast... Jamanra sealed us in the mine when his Dreadnought was complete. This madness must end! Some may call me a traitor, but I do not seek the destruction of my brethren. I seek their salvation.

#### RisuGoWith
Many thanks. Quickly, let's go.
![[Risu - RisuGoWith.ogg]]

#### RisuQuest
I know what Jamanra intends, for the Maraketh have made a grave error. Atop their burial spires lie their most honoured dead. Our new Queen demanded he seek any trace of ancient flesh from those of renown or power in life. He intends to feed their bodies to a horrific creature he keeps in a cage behind his throne. They call it the Beast. I have seen it, and the sight haunts my nightmares...
![[Risu - RisuQuest - 1.ogg]]
![[Risu - RisuQuest - 2.ogg]]

#### Defection
You need not trust me. You will see the truth of my information soon enough. I ask nothing of you, only that you do what you know is right.
![[Risu - Defection.ogg]]

#### The Hooded One
What is that being? Does it travel with you? I would tell you not to trust a mysterious stranger in black, but that would make my own situation rather difficult...
![[Risu - The Hooded One.ogg]]

#### The Maraketh
I cannot say I view the Maraketh favourably, but there is no other power to which I can turn. Jamanra is going mad, and I know that the Maraketh will unite their scattered akharas to confront him if the need is great enough. I believe that it is.
![[Risu - The Maraketh.ogg]]

#### The Ardura
Meeting the Ardura is disconcerting. Like most Faridun, I was left to die in the desert as an infant. Perhaps someone here is my mother or father... I look at each of them wondering what my life could have been if... if they had wanted me. My people are full of anger and distrust, for reasons I hope are clear. They are blinded by this.
![[Risu - The Ardura - 1.ogg]]
![[Risu - The Ardura - 2.ogg]]

#### Asala
I must pursue what I feel to be right. Asala might yet decide to have me put to death, or abandon me to the Doom of the Desert. I knew these risks, but I had to try anyway. If you had seen the darkness rising in the hearts of my brothers and sisters, you would understand. I am not betraying them. I am trying to save them from themselves.
![[Risu - Asala - 1.ogg]]
![[Risu - Asala - 2.ogg]]

#### The Coming Battle
I have given all the help I can. The rest will be up to you and the Ardura. I have no doubt Asala will lead all of you to victory. I would wish you a swift triumph, but I know my maddened brothers and sisters will fight like rabid animals. Do what you must.
![[Risu - The Coming Battle - 1.ogg]]
![[Risu - The Coming Battle - 2.ogg]]

#### Shambrin
Somehow, she knows when I am near. She frowns and turns away. I fear no one here will ever accept me, but I cannot go back to my people now.
![[Risu - Shambrin.ogg]]

#### Shambrin_2
Now that she is willing to talk to me, I find that Shambrin is very kind. I think she understands what it is to be an outsider. If she had been born blind, she would have been a sister-outcast among the Faridun. Being blinded as a warrior, however, guarantees her place among her people. Had I been an Ardura warrior whose lungs became weakened by sickness rather than birth, I would have been her sister here. I think about that life sometimes.
![[Risu - Shambrin_2 - 1.ogg]]
![[Risu - Shambrin_2 - 2.ogg]]

#### The Faridun
The Maraketh have no idea how great we number. We are larger than any one akhara by far, and my brothers and sisters held a great bitterness even before Corruption came among us. Everything we do, from our garb to our food, is made opposite to the Maraketh out of spite. I still feel some of that anger when I see them here, standing proud and colourful. Asala promises them a return to their glory days, but do they not have such glory now?
![[Risu - The Faridun - 1.ogg]]
![[Risu - The Faridun - 2.ogg]]
![[Risu - The Faridun - 3.ogg]]

#### Zarka
She is the only one willing to talk with me. I could listen to her stories for days. She truly does not seem to care that I am not of the Ardura...
![[Risu - Zarka.ogg]]

#### Zarka_2
My life would have been much better if I had known someone like Zarka growing up. She cares about everyone here, no matter their station. She has even told me that if I prove myself, I might be accepted here someday. I think that is something I want.
![[Risu - Zarka_2 - 1.ogg]]
![[Risu - Zarka_2 - 2.ogg]]

#### Corruption
This Corruption that plagues the land. I cannot bring myself to fully believe it is the reason for my people's sickening turn. I know that when the Beast first came to us when Jamanra was raised from death he quickly became covetous and prone to fits of rage. Soon, that fervor gleamed in the eyes of those around him. You say it is Corruption, but I have not seen anything in my brothers and sisters that was not already there. Corruption may exist, yes, but it does not fully control. It only... excuses. The Faridun are warring against the Maraketh because they desire to do so. They have always wanted this conflict. They want to make those who abandoned us suffer.
![[Risu - Corruption - 1.ogg]]
![[Risu - Corruption - 2.ogg]]
![[Risu - Corruption - 3.ogg]]

#### The Maraketh_2
The Maraketh abandoned us, but there is beauty in their strict traditions. They do not have a choice. The desert is a harsh Sekhema, as they say. Uniting as one people, combining our resources - that is the only way we can all live in peace.
![[Risu - The Maraketh_2 - 1.ogg]]
![[Risu - The Maraketh_2 - 2.ogg]]

#### The Dreadnought
We Faridun have never had grand caravans. In our preparations, Jamanra tasked our people with building one of our own. The intent shifted as madness crept upon him. Soon, it became the greatest war machine the Vastiri has ever known. The wish for a better life was gone. Only thoughts of hatred were left.
![[Risu - The Dreadnought - 1.ogg]]
![[Risu - The Dreadnought - 2.ogg]]

#### The Countess
This... Oriana... the one you called a 'Countess'... Jamanra has declared her our Queen. She first came to us from the south, and seemed sympathetic to our cause. She promised us power... the power to take back our lives. She left for Ezomyte lands, vowing to return with something that would resurrect our greatest hero, Jamanra. With that hope dangled before us, the Faridun united for the first time since his death. We prepared, as she asked. We took the quarry. We began working on the Dreadnought. I am ashamed to admit I was a devout believer in the cause... until the day she kept her promise. She did return. She did bring the power to resurrect Jamanra. She brought... the Beast.
![[Risu - The Countess - 1.ogg]]
![[Risu - The Countess - 2.ogg]]
![[Risu - The Countess - 3.ogg]]

#### The Beast
The sight of that thing chilled my soul. Those of us who objected to its presence were forced to work, mining and finishing the Dreadnought. By the time we were done, madness was already rife, and we were sealed in the mine to die for supposedly betraying our people...
![[Risu - The Beast - 1.ogg]]
![[Risu - The Beast - 2.ogg]]

#### Jamanra, the Risen King
I know what Jamanra intends. Atop the burial spires of Deshar lie the Maraketh's most honoured dead. The King has become driven by madness to seek any trace of ancient flesh from those of renown or power in life. He intends to feed their bodies to the horrific creature he keeps in a cage behind his throne. They call it the Beast. I have seen it, and the sight haunts my nightmares...
![[Risu - Jamanra, the Risen King - 1.ogg]]
![[Risu - Jamanra, the Risen King - 2.ogg]]

#### Traitor's Passage
The Halani Gates are closed! Then Jamanra must have succeeded in capturing them. He planned to close the gates to prevent the Maraketh from interrupting his... harvest. A siege from the front would be impossible now. But there is another way. An ancient passage lost to time. It was used by the traitor Balbala. I can show you where it is, if you will use it to stop Jamanra before it is too late.
![[Risu - Traitor's Passage - 1.ogg]]
![[Risu - Traitor's Passage - 2.ogg]]

#### RisuA2TraitorsPassageHover
The Maraketh forgot the location of the Traitor's Passage long ago, but we Faridun kept the knowledge of it for many generations, in the hopes one day we could use it against them...
![[Risu - RisuA2TraitorsPassageHover.ogg]]

#### RisuA2OnZarkaEndOfAct
Zarka thinks it is likely our two peoples will become one. She says she will teach me her tales. She thinks she does not have many years left, but I hope that she does. I would be honoured to replace her, but I do not want to lose her just yet.
![[Risu - RisuA2OnZarkaEndOfAct - 1.ogg]]
![[Risu - RisuA2OnZarkaEndOfAct - 2.ogg]]

#### RisuA2WildIntroShout
Help me! She's insane!
![[Risu - RisuA2WildIntroShout.ogg]]

#### RisuA2WildBossShout_Random
Watch out!
![[Risu - RisuA2WildBossShout_Random.ogg]]

#### RisuA2WildBossShout_2
She's coming!
![[Risu - RisuA2WildBossShout_2.ogg]]

#### RisuA2WildBossShout_3
Run!
![[Risu - RisuA2WildBossShout_3.ogg]]

#### RisuA2WildUnlockCage
Winds praise you!
![[Risu - RisuA2WildUnlockCage.ogg]]

#### RisuA2WildKillRudja
Quickly, break the lock!
![[Risu - RisuA2WildKillRudja.ogg]]

#### RisuA2WildBreakLock_Random
Please! Get me out of here!
![[Risu - RisuA2WildBreakLock_Random.ogg]]

#### RisuA2WildBreakLock_2
What are you waiting for? Get me out of here!
![[Risu - RisuA2WildBreakLock_2.ogg]]

#### RisuVendor_CloseShopNoBuy_Random
Another time then.

#### RisuVendor_CloseShopNoBuy_4
Not today? I understand.

#### RisuVendor_GambleMagic_Random
That is something.

#### RisuVendor_GambleMagic_4
Well, well, my friend.

#### RisuVendor_GambleMagic_7
I am fond of that.

#### RisuVendor_GambleMagic_10
I trust you appreciate that.

#### RisuVendor_GambleNormal_Random
It could be better...

#### RisuVendor_GambleNormal_4
Try again perhaps?

#### RisuVendor_GambleNormal_7
It is not your day.

#### RisuVendor_GambleNormal_10
Do not be forlorn.

#### RisuVendor_GambleNormal_13
The desert is a harsh Sekhema...

#### RisuVendor_GambleRare_Random
That holds power.

#### RisuVendor_GambleRare_4
I wish you well with this.

#### RisuVendor_GambleRare_7
May it please you.

#### RisuVendor_GambleRare_10
I smile, for you.

#### RisuVendor_GambleUnique_Random
A formidable outcome.

#### RisuVendor_GambleUnique_4
Garukhan graces you!

#### RisuVendor_GambleUnique_7
You are one with the winds!

#### RisuVendor_GambleUnique_10
May this change your fate!

#### RisuVendor_OpenShop_Random
Be brave, make a choice.

#### RisuVendor_OpenShop_4
Think carefully.

#### RisuVendor_OpenShop_7
An outcasts trove...

#### RisuVendor_OpenShop_10
Choose, or do not.

#### RisuVendor_OpenShop_13
I can wait.

#### RisuVendor_SellGeneric_Random
I will take this.

#### RisuVendor_SellGeneric_5
The deal is done.

#### RisuVendor_SellGeneric_8
I am pleased.
