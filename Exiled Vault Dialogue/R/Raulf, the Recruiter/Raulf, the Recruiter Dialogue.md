## Raulf, the Recruiter Dialogue
#### Introduction
Oh, Johan and Dannig brought you on? Don't worry, I'll get you all the necessary paperwork shortly. I'm Raulf. The Meridian Free Traders, my guild, sent me here to assist in executing the charter. I connect labourers and specialists with those who have available jobs and capital. I've heard you may be making some decisions around here, so we should definitely do business.

#### Introduction_2
Welcome to Kingsmarch! I'm something of a people person. That's to say, I handle our talent pool! The Meridian Free Traders, my guild, sent me here to assist in executing the charter. I connect labourers and specialists with those who have available jobs and capital. I've heard you may be making some decisions around here, so we should definitely do business.
![[Raulf, the Recruiter - Introduction_2.ogg]]

#### RaulfIntroPostA4
Ah, so you're the 'Exile' I've heard so much about! Statistical deviations like you only come around every thousand years. They're sure to sing songs about your exploits! My best opportunity for being remembered is to support a great hero. I'll recruit others to the cause, as well. Once I explain the benefits of working in Kingsmarch, many people seem quite open to it! The key word seems to be 'gold.'
![[Raulf, the Recruiter - RaulfIntroPostA4.ogg]]

#### RaulfOfferRecruitment
You won't get very far without any workers. We should go through the official papers together. There may be some nominal fees, of course, but I promise it'll be worth it.

#### The Black Knight
The legendary Black Knight is {here?} On this forsaken continent? I grew up hearing tales of his mysterious appearances... he's supposedly been around for centuries. Oh, I simply must reach out. Pulling off that kind of hire would certainly be a Bounty Rune on my family mantle! But what job is prestigious enough for the {Black Knight?} Certainly not a miner, nor a farmer. Smelter? No. Disenchanter? Mm... no. I doubt he has engineering skills. Maybe a recruiter? Haha, wait, no, that's {my} job! He'll have to guard our shipping lanes. Yes! No one would dare interfere with a Kingsmarch shipment if the Black Knight himself was out there on the high seas! Now, what would a figure like him want for payment? Hmm... everyone's got a price...

#### Sasan, the Bandit Lord
It's horrible, how Sasan conducts himself. He could be getting far richer by working here, for us! I've reached out, but I've yet to hear back. I have to wonder if he's reading any of my letters at all! If he did, he would understand my impeccable explanation of his best options. It's simply absurd to remain a bandit, when there are so many opportunities here in Kingsmarch!
![[Raulf, the Recruiter - Sasan, the Bandit Lord.ogg]]

#### Admiral Valerius
Faustus insists I not hire Admiral Valerius. I don't normally take advice from outside the recruiting business, but some of the stories he has told me chill me to the bone. So, I suppose this Valerius fellow will simply have to remain freelance. Pity for him.
![[Raulf, the Recruiter - Admiral Valerius.ogg]]

#### The Tavern
It's not the most auspicious office I've worked in, but it certainly puts me face-to-face with the people of Kingsmarch. I consider it an opportunity!
![[Raulf, the Recruiter - The Tavern.ogg]]

#### The Guilds
Things operate rather loosely here, but back home, almost all official business is done through one or more guilds. Eh, for example, you cannot simply open up a shop and start selling goods. All designated locations for shops have a process that must be undertaken. There are a set number, and they are all currently licensed to major merchants. Every few years, a new license is created, and bid upon by interested parties. Those without the familial wealth to get 'in on the game,' so to speak, may consider moving across the world to new lands, where regulations are not so strict. It's the best argument in favour of a move to Kingsmarch. Bring your family, start a new life!

![[Raulf, the Recruiter - RaulfWildHirelingDies_Random.ogg]]

#### RaulfWildHirelingDies_3
Please do try to keep the workers alive. We hold ourselves to certain standards here.
![[Raulf, the Recruiter - RaulfWildHirelingDies_3.ogg]]

#### RaulfWildHirelingDies_5
We're going to need some replacements. There's been... some misfortune.
![[Raulf, the Recruiter - RaulfWildHirelingDies_5.ogg]]

#### RaulfWildConvoToHimself_Random
It's all about {marketing...}
![[Raulf, the Recruiter - RaulfWildConvoToHimself_Random.ogg]]

#### RaulfWildConvoToHimself_4
'March with us in Kingsmarch!' No no...
![[Raulf, the Recruiter - RaulfWildConvoToHimself_4.ogg]]

#### RaulfWildConvoToHimself_5

![[Raulf, the Recruiter - RaulfWildConvoToHimself_5.ogg]]

#### RaulfWildConvoToHimself_6
'March with us in Kingsmarch!' Oh, no. No...
![[Raulf, the Recruiter - RaulfWildConvoToHimself_6.ogg]]

#### RaulfWildConvoToHimself_7
'At the edge of the world, where even the King might not hear you'... hmm, no, too risky...
![[Raulf, the Recruiter - RaulfWildConvoToHimself_7.ogg]]

#### RaulfWildConvoToHimself_9
'Are you an exile without a home? Kingsmarch is waiting... Kingsmarch is open...' no, no...
![[Raulf, the Recruiter - RaulfWildConvoToHimself_9.ogg]]

#### RaulfWildConvoFaustus
I'm afraid I don't drink, Captain.
![[Raulf, the Recruiter - RaulfWildConvoFaustus.ogg]]

#### RaulfWildConvoJohanOne
This Wraeclast is a strange continent. Full of extremely talented people who despise authority and cooperation. They seek only their own enrichment.
![[Raulf, the Recruiter - RaulfWildConvoJohanOne.ogg]]

#### RaulfWildConvoJohanTwo
I suppose I have a higher-minded ideal.
![[Raulf, the Recruiter - RaulfWildConvoJohanTwo.ogg]]

#### Cryptic Refusal
I will not be your secret ear in Kingsmarch, nor would I aid those you call enemies. I will uphold the integrity of my profession over all other causes. Thank you for your inquiry, and good day. Kindly, Raulf of the Meridian Free Traders
