## Vinderi, the Dismantler Dialogue
#### EntryBanterTullinaVinderiReply
For the job? Or just generally...? I s'pose the answer to both is no, really.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - EntryBanterTullinaVinderiReply.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterVinderiToTullina
Who would like to hear my bordello story?
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - EntryBanterVinderiToTullina.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterVinderiToTullinaTwo
I promise it is very, very graphic.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - EntryBanterVinderiToTullinaTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterTullinaVinderiReply
No, we're all still quite separate.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - ExitBanterTullinaVinderiReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterTullinaVinderiReplyTwo
Not the people down stairs...
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - ExitBanterTullinaVinderiReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterVinderiToTullina
I always get a little sad when a job like this ends.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - ExitBanterVinderiToTullina.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterVinderiToTullinaTwo
I know, I know... But I really enjoyed this one.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - ExitBanterVinderiToTullinaTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTullinaVinderiReply
Tullina! I was just talking about you.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - SelectionBanterTullinaVinderiReply.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTullinaVinderiReplyTwo
Yes. I was just saying to Tullina that I was talking about her.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - SelectionBanterTullinaVinderiReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTullinaVinderiReplyThree
Just now!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - SelectionBanterTullinaVinderiReplyThree.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTullinaVinderiReplyFour
That reminds me! Did I tell you that I was just talking to Tullina? She says hello.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - SelectionBanterTullinaVinderiReplyFour.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterVinderiToTullina
Greetings one and all!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - SelectionBanterVinderiToTullina.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterVinderiToTullinaTwo
Ah! Isla, how are your brilliant inventions?
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - SelectionBanterVinderiToTullinaTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterVinderiToTullinaThree
Wonderful. Is that some new slang term?
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - SelectionBanterVinderiToTullinaThree.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterVinderiToTullinaFour
These plans are absolutely, what was it? Tullina? These plans are tullina, pal!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - SelectionBanterVinderiToTullinaFour.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterVinderiToTullinaFive
Thank you for introducing me to this tullina new word, Isla.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - SelectionBanterVinderiToTullinaFive.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterVinderiToAdiyah
You've got fire magic, don't you, Adiyah?
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - ExitBanterVinderiToAdiyah.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterVinderiToAdiyahTwo
Where do you draw it from? Is it in the palms? The fingers? If your hand were accidentally severed, could it still light a flame?
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - ExitBanterVinderiToAdiyahTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterAdiyahVinderiReply
They went off with a bang! Which was quite a lot quieter than I'd intended, actually...
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - ExitBanterAdiyahVinderiReply.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterTibbsVinderiReply
Reddy! I'd always wondered what your first name was. Teddy Ribbs. Got it.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - EntryBanterTibbsVinderiReply.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterVinderiToTibbs
Sometimes I think about retiring.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - EntryBanterVinderiToTibbs.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterVinderiToTibbsTwo
But what?
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - EntryBanterVinderiToTibbsTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterTibbsVinderiReply
And if anyone else gets sad when they're alone with their thoughts, I'll be at the bar!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - ExitBanterTibbsVinderiReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterVinderiToTibbs
Gods I feel so young again! Tibbs! Let me lift you up!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - ExitBanterVinderiToTibbs.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterVinderiToTibbsTwo
I can do it!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - ExitBanterVinderiToTibbsTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTibbsVinderiReply
Ribs!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - SelectionBanterTibbsVinderiReply.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTibbsVinderiReplyTwo
Tight! Ribs! Err, right! Tibbs! I've got a new formula for you to try.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - SelectionBanterTibbsVinderiReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTibbsVinderiReplyThree
Just like the last one, but I've enriched the quicksilver with Chimeral blood. Really gives it a kick.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - SelectionBanterTibbsVinderiReplyThree.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTibbsVinderiReplyFour
Just don't give it an actual kick.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - SelectionBanterTibbsVinderiReplyFour.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTibbsVinderiReplyFive
Anytibbs, Time.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - SelectionBanterTibbsVinderiReplyFive.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterVinderiToTibbs
Hello, hello, hello!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - SelectionBanterVinderiToTibbs.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterVinderiToTibbsTwo
Never better, never better. Spent the last hour in a very enclosed space with far more voltaxic sulphite than I've ever laid eyes on before, and I must say, I do not see what all the fuss was about. So, what's this we're looking at. Some sort of cuboid creature? Where's the heart?
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - SelectionBanterVinderiToTibbsTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterVinderiToTibbsThree
Did it step in paint? Can we just trace the prints back and find its nest?
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - SelectionBanterVinderiToTibbsThree.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterVinderiToTibbsFour
Ah! A job! I see it now. Yes. Good. This means I'll need to prepare more sulphite.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - SelectionBanterVinderiToTibbsFour.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterKarstVinderiReply
Of course. Last time was an anomaly, I swear.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - EntryBanterKarstVinderiReply.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterVinderiToKarst
Which way? Ah. Right.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - EntryBanterVinderiToKarst.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterVinderiToKarstTwo
Right!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - EntryBanterVinderiToKarstTwo.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterVinderiToKarstThree
Right.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - EntryBanterVinderiToKarstThree.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterKarstVinderiReply
Celebrate what? What did I miss?
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - ExitBanterKarstVinderiReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterVinderiToKarst
Wait, is this where we came in?
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - ExitBanterVinderiToKarst.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterKarstVinderiReply
Ah! Yes! What you're smelling is actually a new powder blend I'm trialling. Eggs and decaying meat, yes?
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - SelectionBanterKarstVinderiReply.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterKarstVinderiReplyTwo
Fish!? ...Fish. Ah! Right! I've also brought a fish.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - SelectionBanterKarstVinderiReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterKarstVinderiReplyThree
What powder?
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - SelectionBanterKarstVinderiReplyThree.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterKarstVinderiReplyFour
What fish?
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - SelectionBanterKarstVinderiReplyFour.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterVinderiToKarst
You needed me?
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - SelectionBanterVinderiToKarst.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterVinderiToKarstTwo
Oh, you know, has its downs and ups. Still tack as a sharp though!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - SelectionBanterVinderiToKarstTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterVinderiToIsla
Hello, Isla.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - SelectionBanterVinderiToIsla.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterVinderiToIslaTwo
The new moon approaches. Shall we have that competition of explosions we spoke about?
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - SelectionBanterVinderiToIslaTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterVinderiToIslaThree
And yet they do...
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - SelectionBanterVinderiToIslaThree.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterIslaVinderiReply
I... I don't remember. Do you?
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - SelectionBanterIslaVinderiReply.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterIslaVinderiReplyTwo
Badwyth Nems? Is that Ezomyte? I'll write it down so I don't forget. Right under Vinderi. I think that's the tall lad.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - SelectionBanterIslaVinderiReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterVinderiToIsla
Do we really need to infiltrate anything? Between you and me, Isla, we could just blow the whole thing up.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - EntryBanterVinderiToIsla.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterIslaVinderiReply
Never met the lad. Knew a concubine, though. Loads of children.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - EntryBanterIslaVinderiReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterVinderiToIsla
This mission is going to be spectacular. I've got all sorts of explosives to set, and they'll never even see it coming.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - ExitBanterVinderiToIsla.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterVinderiToIslaTwo
You'll have to excuse me for a moment once we're back home, then.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - ExitBanterVinderiToIslaTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterIslaVinderiReply
Try out new powders, of course!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - ExitBanterIslaVinderiReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterIslaVinderiReplyTwo
No! It's MY share, and that includes any notes in it!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - ExitBanterIslaVinderiReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### IntroductionVinderiForGianna
Exile this is... This is...
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - IntroductionVinderiForGianna.ogg]]

#### IntroductionVinderiForGiannaTwo
Gianna! Yes! And she's a... erm...
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - IntroductionVinderiForGiannaTwo.ogg]]

#### IntroductionVinderiForGiannaThree
A performer actress! Right! And... ehhh...
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - IntroductionVinderiForGiannaThree.ogg]]

#### IntroductionVinderiForGiannaFour
Exactly! Anything you'd like to add Gianna?
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - IntroductionVinderiForGiannaFour.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterGiannaVinderiReply
Lass, that might be the stupidest idea I've ever heard.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - EntryBanterGiannaVinderiReply.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterVinderiToGianna
What happened to that little basement theatre where we first met, Gianna?
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - EntryBanterVinderiToGianna.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterVinderiToGiannaTwo
Hah! That's right. Good memories.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - EntryBanterVinderiToGiannaTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterGiannaVinderiReply
Please no, my bloody knees are giving me trouble.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - ExitBanterGiannaVinderiReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterVinderiToGianna
Worthy of a grand play, eh Gianna?
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - ExitBanterVinderiToGianna.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterGiannaVinderiReply
Already? I thought we had at least a few weeks! What do we do?! WHAT DO WE DO!?
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - SelectionBanterGiannaVinderiReply.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterGiannaVinderiReplyTwo
What!? Oh, thank the gods.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - SelectionBanterGiannaVinderiReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterGiannaVinderiReplyThree
Nothing! Nothing! Just... if a living flame asks after me, I'm not here.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - SelectionBanterGiannaVinderiReplyThree.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterVinderiToGianna
Whoops, must've taken a wrong turn.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - SelectionBanterVinderiToGianna.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterVinderiToGiannaTwo
Well that's lucky! I'd just cancelled my plans for the rest of the day.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - SelectionBanterVinderiToGiannaTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterVinderiToGiannaThree
Oh, just the usual armour. Helps protect the ol' bones.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - SelectionBanterVinderiToGiannaThree.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterVinderiToGiannaFour
I'm afraid I'm busy, dear. Got a heist to plan. Very flattered though.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - SelectionBanterVinderiToGiannaFour.ogg]]

#### Introduction
Hm? Ah! Right, Ahem. Vinderi. Pleasure to meet your acquaintance. Err, pleased to make you. Hello. Name's Vinderi. Did I mention that already? No one alive knows as much about the explosive arts as me. If you want something or someone, or several someones, turned into an unrecognisable, smouldering mess, I'm more than happy to oblige.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - Introduction.ogg]]

#### The Boss
I was walking around the catacombs beneath the square, trying to find my way to the sewers under the courts. Had a huge sack of the blue stuff on my back. Leaving a little trail as I go so I can find my way out. Little azurite fuse trail winding its way back to the storehouse. Cost me an arm and a leg, that powder. Anyway, I'm right under where I thought the High Templar's office was. Start piling the powder up right under his fat arse. Planning to blow him back to Innocence. Well, I start hearing a hissing noise. And I start seeing the blue light down the end of the tunnel turning an angry red. It's moving towards me quick. And I'm thinking, this is it. This is where it ends for me, but at least I'll blow that high pain in the arse skyward. Then it stops. No hissing. No light. Just a silhouette. Tall as a man ever was. Taller than Tibbs. Don't know how he even got through the storehouse hole. This man... this glorious man! Put it down! He shouts. It's not worth the trouble. Come. It's time to go! So I put the bag down, and I start walking over to him. Running even. This man saved my life. I swear to myself I'll follow this Eternal Ideal of a man, this statue, this perfect specimen, as far as he will have me. And as I get close, my eyes adjust. This beautiful man comes into focus. His hand is extended to meet me. I reach out mine. There's an electricity between us. And as my fingers lock into his, he slaps a manacle around my wrist. I'm under arrest for attempted deicide and possession of a dangerous substance. Got me exiled, the pig. Once I got here I just started working for the boss. What was your question?
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - The Boss.ogg]]

#### VinderiOnNikoOne
Niko? Niko... Was he the lad with the club foot? No, wait, Niko was the haberdasher. The bordello owner? No?
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiOnNikoOne.ogg]]

#### VinderiOnNikoTwo
Niko... ah! Of course! The miner boy. That's miner, not, er, minor. I do believe he was of age when last I saw him. Strange lad. Always felt like he was talking at me, not to me, if you follow. Had an awful lot of yellow powder for sale. Wonder what ever happened to him? Lost track of many in that line of work. A shame, but not a surprise.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiOnNikoTwo.ogg]]

#### Grocery List
You've got a contract you want me to take a look at? Alright, why not. Mmhm. Mmm. Yes. Well, everything seems to be in order. ... ...Oh! This was mine! Well, the designs have changed a bit, but the fundamentals are the same. It's a grocery list, except instead of the markets, we're going to an alchemy storehouse I'm not supposed to know exists. And instead of groceries, we're going to collect a number of powders, ichors and minerals I'm running low on. And instead of paying for them, we are going to steal them. So in that sense, it is very unlike a grocery list. Straightforward enough. Ready to go?
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - Grocery List.ogg]]

#### Grocery List_2
...Thirty three cubits of cerulean alloy thread, half an ounce of vitriolic talc, two quarts of bishop-blessed cleansing alcohol -- that's for me -- and enough barrel hoops to sink a bloated bonechewer. Perfect. ...Wait. Hold on. Hold on one dang minute. Where the--... Where is the fumarole tar? Don't tell me I forgot the fumarole tar! Without the tar I might as well be baking a tray of Keth flatbread. Oh dear. I didn't even have it on the list. Sorry, Exile, the error is mine. You've earned your markers. Hopefully I'll have enough left to take out another contract.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - Grocery List_2.ogg]]

#### The Vinderi Bomb
Hmm? Oh! At last! The Fumarole Tar job! Gods, I've been chomping at the bit for this contract. I've drawn up plans for a bomb that, well, let's just say it'll put The Ring on the map. Or take it off the map. It might take quite a large area off the map, actually. I tend to deal with controlled explosions, but who doesn't love an uncontrolled explosion? Whoever's nearby, that's who! But other than them, they're great! And this is going to be really, really great. There's only one place I know of that houses enough Fumarole Tar for the job, and it has all sorts of other experimental goodies that I'd like to get my hands on, too. Exile, this thing is really going to set your world on fire. I feel like a child again!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - The Vinderi Bomb.ogg]]

#### The Vinderi Bomb_2
I've finished it, Exile. It's all done! The Vinderi Bomb is complete at last! I've named it after myself. It's my legacy. Or, the ruins it will leave in its wake will be my legacy. I wonder if it works... Shall we try it out? We only get one attempt! Let's do it!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - The Vinderi Bomb_2.ogg]]

#### Fireworks
Bwaaahahaha! Had you going there for a bit, didn't I? I may be old, but I've still got a little pop left in my powderkeg. Did you really think I was about to blow us all to Innocence? Give this old man a little credit! I just wanted to give the good folk here a little show. I call these beauties "Explodey-make-good-lookers". Catchy, eh? Reckon there might be a business in it! Well, I hope you enjoyed it. Consider it a show of gratitude.

Good timing. I've been looking for something to do.

#### VinderiSelectedBlueprintOne
Needed a reason to stretch these old legs.

Mmhm? Seems straightforward enough.

Cheap piece of junk anyway.

#### VinderiVaultBreakingThree
Let's pop this little sucker open.

Hmm, tricky, but not impossible.

Haven't come across this make before. Well, let's give it a go.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiVaultBreakingFive.ogg]]

#### VinderiVaultBreakingSix
Ooh. Solidly built. Open up to me. It's okay, be vulnerable.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiVaultBreakingSix.ogg]]

#### VinderiEngineeringOne
Now, how do I work this thing again?
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiEngineeringOne.ogg]]

#### VinderiEngineeringTwo
Con-fangled dang contraptions.

#### VinderiEngineeringThree
You don't expect me to jump, do you?
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiEngineeringThree.ogg]]

#### VinderiEngineeringFour
I have the thing for this somewhere...
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiEngineeringFour.ogg]]

#### VinderiEngineeringFive
I did bring the thing. Did I? Thought I did...
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiEngineeringFive.ogg]]

#### VinderiEngineeringSix
I was hoping I wouldn't have to remember how to use this blasted thing
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiEngineeringSix.ogg]]

#### VinderiDismantleTrapOne
Ah, clever. Not clever enough, but still.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiDismantleTrapOne.ogg]]

#### VinderiDismantleTrapTwo
Not the worst trap. Not the best, but not the worst.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiDismantleTrapTwo.ogg]]

#### VinderiDismantleTrapThree
Just pop this spring and...
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiDismantleTrapThree.ogg]]

#### VinderiDismantleTrapFour
Oh, those clever bastards. Hmm. Hmmmmmm.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiDismantleTrapFour.ogg]]

#### VinderiDismantleTrapFive
Easy pe--...oh. Oh no. Oh? Oh.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiDismantleTrapFive.ogg]]

#### VinderiDismantleTrapSix
Huh. Looks like a twist on a Maloney design.

#### VinderiDemolitionOne
Hee hee hee hee hee!'

Fun fun fun!

#### VinderiDemolitionThree
Hold onto your butts!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiDemolitionThree.ogg]]

#### VinderiDemolitionFour
This needs a BIG one.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiDemolitionFour.ogg]]

#### VinderiDemolitionFive
Yes, yes... I have just the thing!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiDemolitionFive.ogg]]

#### VinderiDemolitionSix
I've been saving this one just for you.

Eh? It can wait.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiBusyOne.ogg]]

#### VinderiBusyTwo
You blind? Or just daft?
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiBusyTwo.ogg]]

#### VinderiBusyThree
Don't rush me.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiBusyThree.ogg]]

#### VinderiBusyFour
Oh, sure, rush the guy with the bombs.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiBusyFour.ogg]]

#### VinderiBusyFive
"It was all going so well, then Vinderi blew us all up because I got impatient."

#### VinderiInterruptedOne
Pick on someone your own age.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiInterruptedOne.ogg]]

#### VinderiInterruptedTwo
Moron. Moronic moron.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiInterruptedTwo.ogg]]

#### VinderiInterruptedThree
Stop hitting me, you nitwit. I have BOMBS.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiInterruptedThree.ogg]]

Idiot's trying to blow us both up!

I'm old, but you'll still die sooner!

Quick, get 'em.

#### VinderiCombatStartThree
We've been spotted!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiCombatStartThree.ogg]]

#### VinderiCombatStartFour
We have company!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiCombatStartFour.ogg]]

#### VinderiCombatStartFive
Oi, incoming.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiCombatStartFive.ogg]]

#### VinderiCombatEndOne
Feel so young again.

Whew, that gets the ol' heart racing.

Tougher than I look, eh?

Experience wins.

#### VinderiLootingOne
Well, well!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiLootingOne.ogg]]

#### VinderiLootingTwo
That, my friend, is very expensive looking.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiLootingTwo.ogg]]

#### VinderiLootingThree
She's a beaut.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiLootingThree.ogg]]

#### VinderiLootingFour
In my younger days I'd fight you for that.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiLootingFour.ogg]]

#### VinderiLootingFive
Bit of advice: keep that little find to yourself.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiLootingFive.ogg]]

#### VinderiAlertThresholdOne
I think we're pushing it.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiAlertThresholdOne.ogg]]

#### VinderiAlertThresholdTwo
We're going to get found out if we're not careful.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiAlertThresholdTwo.ogg]]

#### VinderiAlertThresholdThree
When even I think we're too loud, that's a problem.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiAlertThresholdThree.ogg]]

#### VinderiAlertThresholdFour
Cutting it close.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiAlertThresholdFour.ogg]]

#### VinderiAlarmOne
We have to leave!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiAlarmOne.ogg]]

#### VinderiAlarmTwo

#### VinderiEarlyAlarmTwo
That noise? That is not a good noise.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiEarlyAlarmTwo.ogg]]

#### VinderiEarlyAlarmThree
I know that sound. That's a bad sound.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiEarlyAlarmThree.ogg]]

#### VinderiFinalRoomOne
There she is.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiFinalRoomOne.ogg]]

#### VinderiFinalRoomTwo
Well, go on then. That's what we're here for.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiFinalRoomTwo.ogg]]

#### VinderiFinalRoomThree
That's what we're after, right?
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiFinalRoomThree.ogg]]

#### VinderiFinalRoomFour
We've made it this far. Why stop now?
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiFinalRoomFour.ogg]]

#### VinderiFinalRoomFive
Pride cometh before the alarm.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiFinalRoomFive.ogg]]

#### VinderiObjectiveLootedOne
And now we run.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiObjectiveLootedOne.ogg]]

#### VinderiObjectiveLootedTwo
Come on, legs, don't fail me now.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiObjectiveLootedTwo.ogg]]

#### VinderiObjectiveLootedThree
Great! ...How do we get out of here again?
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiObjectiveLootedThree.ogg]]

#### VinderiObjectiveLootedFour
How about you get us out of here, huh?
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiObjectiveLootedFour.ogg]]

#### VinderiEntryBanterOne
Wait. Powder, sparks, probe aaaand... Yep. We're good.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiEntryBanterOne.ogg]]

#### VinderiEntryBanterTwo
Even at my age, the quiet before a job gives me goosebumps.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiEntryBanterTwo.ogg]]

#### VinderiEntryBanterThree
Remember to breathe when we get in. Can't tell you how many good men and women I've lost to forgetting to breathe.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiEntryBanterThree.ogg]]

#### VinderiEntryBanterFourA
Bit of advice from an old hand: Whatever you do, and this is really, really important,
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiEntryBanterFourA.ogg]]

#### VinderiEntryBanterFourB
so listen carefully. Don't, and I repeat, don't, DO NOT, forget to follow this advice. Here it is:
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiEntryBanterFourB.ogg]]

#### VinderiEntryBanterFourC
I suggest you listen, because if you listen, you'll really take it on board.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiEntryBanterFourC.ogg]]

#### VinderiEntryBanterFourD
Too many of your generation forget to listen, especially when good advice is being given.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiEntryBanterFourD.ogg]]

#### VinderiEntryBanterFourE
Are you listening? Don't get distracted.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiEntryBanterFourE.ogg]]

#### VinderiEntryBanterFourF
It's easy to hear someone, but listening and hearing are two totally different things. So don't just hear; listen.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiEntryBanterFourF.ogg]]

#### VinderiEntryBanterFourG
Here. Where? What?
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiEntryBanterFourG.ogg]]

#### VinderiEntryBanterFourH
What are you looking at me for?
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiEntryBanterFourH.ogg]]

#### VinderiEntryBanterFourI
We're on a job. Don't just stare at me. Focus!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiEntryBanterFourI.ogg]]

#### VinderiEntryBanterFourJ
Ridiculous.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiEntryBanterFourJ.ogg]]

#### VinderiEntryBanterFourK
Why do they keep taking on these glassy-eyed dimwits.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiEntryBanterFourK.ogg]]

#### VinderiEntryBanterFive
People ask me why I do this at my age. People are rude.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiEntryBanterFive.ogg]]

#### VinderiExitBanterOne
Oh, me heart! I auugh-- ...Oh, thank the gods. False alarm.
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiExitBanterOne.ogg]]

#### VinderiExitBanterTwo
Glad I didn't tell you I nearly blew my arms off during prep!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiExitBanterTwo.ogg]]

#### VinderiExitBanterThree
You are mad, Exile. Mad! And I love it!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiExitBanterThree.ogg]]

#### VinderiExitBanterFour
What a rush! Can't pay for that kind of experience. Even crazier that we're getting paid to do it!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiExitBanterFour.ogg]]

#### VinderiExitBanterFive
Hahaha! I'd never've told my kids this, but gods, I love crime. I just love doing a good crime!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiExitBanterFive.ogg]]

#### VinderiVaultBreakingLoudOne
You sure?! Okay...!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiVaultBreakingLoudOne.ogg]]

#### VinderiVaultBreakingLoudTwo
Really? Now?!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiVaultBreakingLoudTwo.ogg]]

#### VinderiVaultBreakingLoudThree
Gods, you're serious...!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiVaultBreakingLoudThree.ogg]]

#### VinderiVaultBreakingLoudFour
"Vinderi, you're not busy running for your life are you?!"
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiVaultBreakingLoudFour.ogg]]

#### VinderiVaultBreakingLoudFive
You're insane, you know that, right?!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiVaultBreakingLoudFive.ogg]]

#### VinderiVaultBreakingLoudSix
I don't work well under pressure!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiVaultBreakingLoudSix.ogg]]

#### VinderiEngineeringLoudOne
Where's the blasted thing!?
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiEngineeringLoudOne.ogg]]

#### VinderiEngineeringLoudTwo
How in the--... oh! Found it!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiEngineeringLoudTwo.ogg]]

#### VinderiEngineeringLoudThree
Go, go you stupid-...!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiEngineeringLoudThree.ogg]]

#### VinderiEngineeringLoudFour
You have the thing!? Wait, I have the thing!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiEngineeringLoudFour.ogg]]

#### VinderiEngineeringLoudFive
Ah! I've got the thing for this! Here we go--no, that's not it. AH! Here we go!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiEngineeringLoudFive.ogg]]

#### VinderiEngineeringLoudSix
A gap! I have just the tool for this. Somewhere. Did I drop it? Ha! I was holding it! Don't you just hate that?!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiEngineeringLoudSix.ogg]]

#### VinderiDismantleTrapLoudOne
This is meant to be DELICATE work!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiDismantleTrapLoudOne.ogg]]

#### VinderiDismantleTrapLoudTwo
The whole place is a damnable death trap!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiDismantleTrapLoudTwo.ogg]]

#### VinderiDismantleTrapLoudThree
Wait! This thing's rigged to kill us!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiDismantleTrapLoudThree.ogg]]

#### VinderiDismantleTrapLoudFour
Gods! You were planning to blunder into this thing!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiDismantleTrapLoudFour.ogg]]

#### VinderiDismantleTrapLoudFive
Trap! Trap! Stop! There's a trap! A trap!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiDismantleTrapLoudFive.ogg]]

#### VinderiDismantleTrapLoudSix
This is exactly the sort of thing we should have handled earlier!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiDismantleTrapLoudSix.ogg]]

#### VinderiDemolitionLoudOne
VinderiDemolitionLoudOne
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiDemolitionLoudOne.ogg]]

#### VinderiDemolitionLoudTwo
Can't even take the time to enjoy this!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiDemolitionLoudTwo.ogg]]

#### VinderiDemolitionLoudThree
I hate everything about this!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiDemolitionLoudThree.ogg]]

#### VinderiDemolitionLoudFour
If I die, I hope this blows you up too!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiDemolitionLoudFour.ogg]]

#### VinderiDemolitionLoudFive
Gods, these are NOT ideal conditions for handling explosive materials!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiDemolitionLoudFive.ogg]]

#### VinderiDemolitionLoudSix
I wanted to save this one for a special occasion. You owe me a new bomb!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiDemolitionLoudSix.ogg]]

#### VinderiBusyLoudOne
You've lost the plot!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiBusyLoudOne.ogg]]

#### VinderiBusyLoudTwo
I don't have a twin you know! He's long dead!!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiBusyLoudTwo.ogg]]

#### VinderiBusyLoudThree
What!? Now!?
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiBusyLoudThree.ogg]]

#### VinderiBusyLoudFour
I. Am. Busy!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiBusyLoudFour.ogg]]

#### VinderiBusyLoudFive
I'm too old for this!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiBusyLoudFive.ogg]]

#### VinderiInterruptedLoudOne
Old man under attack!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiInterruptedLoudOne.ogg]]

#### VinderiInterruptedLoudTwo
Elder abuse!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiInterruptedLoudTwo.ogg]]

#### VinderiInterruptedLoudThree
Not like this! Not like this!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiInterruptedLoudThree.ogg]]

Can't celebrate yet!

Any more? Huh!?

#### VinderiCombatEndLoudFive
Old, but strong!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiCombatEndLoudFive.ogg]]

#### VinderiLootingLoudOne
Why are you still grabbing things!?
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiLootingLoudOne.ogg]]

#### VinderiLootingLoudTwo
Can't use it if you're dead!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiLootingLoudTwo.ogg]]

#### VinderiLootingLoudThree
Focus on escaping!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiLootingLoudThree.ogg]]

#### VinderiLootingLoudFour
Attention span of a toddler!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiLootingLoudFour.ogg]]

#### VinderiLootingLoudFive
Great, now you got more loot than brains!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiLootingLoudFive.ogg]]

Get it! Get it now!

#### VinderiFinalRoomLoudFive
If you don't get it now, you don't get it at all!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiFinalRoomLoudFive.ogg]]

#### VinderiObjectiveLootedLoudOne
Get a move on!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiObjectiveLootedLoudOne.ogg]]

#### VinderiObjectiveLootedLoudTwo
That's it! Now out! Out!
![[Vinderi, the Dismantler - VinderiObjectiveLootedLoudTwo.ogg]]

Got it? Then move!

Go on then! Make a path!
