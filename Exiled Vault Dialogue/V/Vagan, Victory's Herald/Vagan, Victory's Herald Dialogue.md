## Vagan, Victory's Herald Dialogue
#### VaganPrimaryDefenderStartsFightZero
Ho, exile! Care for a scrap?
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganPrimaryDefenderStartsFightZero.ogg]]

#### VaganPrimaryDefenderStartsFightOne
Exile! You invade, we defend. Have at it!
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganPrimaryDefenderStartsFightOne.ogg]]

#### VaganPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwo
I'll defend the cargo as I would a king or queen!
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwo.ogg]]

#### VaganPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThree
I'm no fan of this proving ground, but I still have to do my job.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThree.ogg]]

#### VaganPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFour
Mmm, surprise tussle!
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFour.ogg]]

#### VaganPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFive
Interrogation was not pleasant. Consider me miffed.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFive.ogg]]

#### VaganPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSix
Let's keep it simple this time, exile. Try to best me.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSix.ogg]]

#### VaganPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSeven
I'm ashamed of what I did last time, exile. Don't think I'll be repeating it again!
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSeven.ogg]]

#### VaganPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEight
With this new power, this time I've got the upper hand!
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEight.ogg]]

#### VaganPrimaryDefenderStartsFightNine
Ah, back for more knocking around?
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganPrimaryDefenderStartsFightNine.ogg]]

#### VaganPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTen
Let's see how you weather my blows now!
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTen.ogg]]

#### VaganPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEleven
This ability is... erm... new.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEleven.ogg]]

#### VaganPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwelve
Let's see how you fight when you can hardly move!
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwelve.ogg]]

#### VaganPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThirteen
A bit of elemental protection should change the balance of this struggle.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThirteen.ogg]]

#### VaganPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFourteen
Let's see you handle a bit of cold!
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFourteen.ogg]]

#### VaganSafehouseLeaderIntroZero
Let's see how you fare in my arena.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganSafehouseLeaderIntroZero.ogg]]

#### VaganSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero
Let's make this a team defense match!
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero.ogg]]

#### VaganSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne
A running battle? Glorious!
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne.ogg]]

#### VaganSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo
Let's get this one over with.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo.ogg]]

#### VaganSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree
A right toss-up. This was meant to be quick and clean!
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree.ogg]]

#### VaganSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour
I feel like jumping in.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour.ogg]]

#### VaganSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive
Well, we certainly can't let this place fall.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive.ogg]]

#### VaganSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix
Come on old chap, put those Ancestors to work!
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix.ogg]]

#### VaganSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven
Don't scratch me, Tora... well, until we're done, that is.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven.ogg]]

#### VaganSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight
Let's see if you can earn an honourable kill, Vorici.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight.ogg]]

#### VaganSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine
Ha, Guff, I'll go high, you go low!
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine.ogg]]

#### VaganSecondaryDefenderArrivalTen
May the best man win, Thane. That is where we agree.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganSecondaryDefenderArrivalTen.ogg]]

#### VaganSecondaryDefenderArrivalEleven
I've been itching for a good fight! Mind if I jump in?
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganSecondaryDefenderArrivalEleven.ogg]]

#### VaganSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwelve
I'm going to mix this one up a bit.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwelve.ogg]]

#### VaganSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirteen
A moving target! I love a challenge.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirteen.ogg]]

#### VaganSecondaryDefenderArrivalFourteen
I am not a fan of what goes on here. Time for a ruckus.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganSecondaryDefenderArrivalFourteen.ogg]]

#### VaganSecondaryDefenderArrivalFifteen
Free for all!
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganSecondaryDefenderArrivalFifteen.ogg]]

#### VaganSecondaryDefenderArrivalSixteen
I promise there's nothing personal about this.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganSecondaryDefenderArrivalSixteen.ogg]]

#### VaganSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeventeen
You'll have to earn this kill, ol' stabby.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeventeen.ogg]]

#### VaganSecondaryDefenderArrivalEighteen
Guff.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganSecondaryDefenderArrivalEighteen.ogg]]

#### VaganSecondaryDefenderArrivalNineteen
Show me some of that Redblade swagger!
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganSecondaryDefenderArrivalNineteen.ogg]]

#### VaganSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwenty
Let me see some of that Mutewind cunning.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwenty.ogg]]

#### VaganSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyOne
Oh, I can't miss this!
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyOne.ogg]]

#### VaganReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero
I'll hold this base against all forces.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero.ogg]]

#### VaganReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne
You're responsible for the consequences!
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne.ogg]]

#### VaganReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo
You are aware we need to do our jobs, right?
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo.ogg]]

#### VaganReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree
Daresso's arse, you can't be serious!
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree.ogg]]

#### VaganReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour
Always enjoy a bloody good tussle!
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour.ogg]]

#### VaganReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive
You knew what this was, Tora. I never made any promises!
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive.ogg]]

#### VaganReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix
I'm sorry, what? And no! Absolutely not!
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix.ogg]]

#### VaganReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven
Why me?
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven.ogg]]

#### VaganReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight
Keep trying, Riker. You'll never measure up!
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight.ogg]]

#### VaganReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine
This fight just got interesting!
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine.ogg]]

#### VaganReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalTen
We'll certainly lock this down now.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalTen.ogg]]

#### VaganReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalEleven
Your chances are shrinking, exile.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalEleven.ogg]]

#### VaganReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwelve
Not the prettiest job, but not one I'm willing to lose!
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwelve.ogg]]

#### VaganReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirteen
The challenge of your life, exile!
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirteen.ogg]]

#### VaganReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFourteen
Come on Leo, show me that Redmane style!
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFourteen.ogg]]

#### VaganReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFifteen
Now I'm the one on top, Tora!
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFifteen.ogg]]

#### VaganReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSixteen
Show them some Brinerot lightning!
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSixteen.ogg]]

#### VaganReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeventeen
Unleash that Redblade fire!
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeventeen.ogg]]

#### VaganReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalEighteen
Freeze them in terror, Mutewind!
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalEighteen.ogg]]

#### VaganReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalNineteen
You there. Look alive, rouse to battle!
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalNineteen.ogg]]

#### VaganKillPlayerZero
Ah, over too soon!
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganKillPlayerZero.ogg]]

#### VaganKillPlayerOne
A fight for the ages!
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganKillPlayerOne.ogg]]

#### VaganKillPlayerTwo
Ugh. Sorry you had to fall here, among all this.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganKillPlayerTwo.ogg]]

#### VaganKillPlayerThree
A rousing success!
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganKillPlayerThree.ogg]]

#### VaganEscapeZero
A good death never hurt anyone!
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganEscapeZero.ogg]]

#### VaganEscapeOne
Exhilarating conflict, exile!
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganEscapeOne.ogg]]

#### VaganEscapeTwo
Done at last. So long, exile!
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganEscapeTwo.ogg]]

#### VaganDefeatedZero
A good strike... and a painful one.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganDefeatedZero.ogg]]

#### VaganDefeatedOne
Uggggh...
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganDefeatedOne.ogg]]

#### VaganDefeatedTwo
Please... not... here...
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganDefeatedTwo.ogg]]

#### VaganDefeatedThree
Only fair... I suppose...!
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganDefeatedThree.ogg]]

#### VaganDefeatedFour
Be a friend... don't lock me up... again.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganDefeatedFour.ogg]]

#### VaganDefeatedFive
A spot more... wheeling and dealing...?
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganDefeatedFive.ogg]]

#### VaganDefeatedSix
Bitter justice... for my betrayal...
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganDefeatedSix.ogg]]

#### VaganDefeatedSeven
One death... is as good as another.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganDefeatedSeven.ogg]]

#### VaganDefeatedEight
I see... you've been training!
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganDefeatedEight.ogg]]

#### VaganDefeatedNine
A proper good turnabout...
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganDefeatedNine.ogg]]

#### VaganDefeatedTen
Well this... is embarrassing...
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganDefeatedTen.ogg]]

#### VaganOfferBargainZero
Exile, you're taking all of this far too personally! But I must confess, I'd rather not be the next on the chopping block. Go on then... what do you need from me?
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganOfferBargainZero.ogg]]

#### VaganOfferBargainOne
A fair fight's fine and all, but it's not exactly a challenge, is it? Putting aside your goals here, have you considered the joys of duelling duos? Pick a partner, and we can start some on-the-job training.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganOfferBargainOne.ogg]]

#### VaganOfferBargainTwo
You know, I know a thing or two that might tickle your fancy. I just need to verify with a confederate of mine that I do in fact know what I know, you know?
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganOfferBargainTwo.ogg]]

#### VaganOfferBargainThree
A fighter doesn't just swing a sword. Combat is a complex dance that tests every muscle. Meanwhile, I'm stuck here doing the same things over and over. A waste, if you ask me! I think this loss is a surefire sign that I need to stretch some other muscles. Let me go, and that's exactly what I'll do.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganOfferBargainThree.ogg]]

#### VaganOfferBargainFour
There's no 'I' in teamwork. There's also no glory in teamwork. But there is an 'I' in glory if you spell it wrong. I think it's time I explored my options solo. Free me, and the next time you encounter the Syndicate, it won't include me.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganOfferBargainFour.ogg]]

#### VaganOfferBargainFive
I may have a reputation for loquaciousness, but I'm a keen listener, too. If you spare my life, I might be convinced to merge these two hobbies of mine into a tight little info package.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganOfferBargainFive.ogg]]

#### VaganOfferBargainSix
Victory must be rewarded, I always say, and while beheading me might be reward for some, I think you'd prefer something more useful.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganOfferBargainSix.ogg]]

#### VaganBargainAcceptedZero
Until next time!
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganBargainAcceptedZero.ogg]]

#### VaganBargainAcceptedOne
I'm a man of my word.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganBargainAcceptedOne.ogg]]

#### VaganBargainAcceptedTwo
Feeling more limber already!
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganBargainAcceptedTwo.ogg]]

#### VaganBargainAcceptedThree
Glory, here I come.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganBargainAcceptedThree.ogg]]

#### VaganBargainAcceptedFour
Good choice. Now listen up!
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganBargainAcceptedFour.ogg]]

#### VaganBargainAcceptedFive
All that glitters is gold... or steel.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganBargainAcceptedFive.ogg]]

#### VaganOfferBetrayalZero
What's a man to do when his blunderous immediate superior continually forces him into unwinnable situations? Take down the immediate superior. Care to lend a hand?
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganOfferBetrayalZero.ogg]]

#### VaganOfferBetrayalOne
My team here has been nothing but dead weight dragging me into the mire. Time to get back to my roots! Let me claim what I will from them, and be on my way, and you can do with them what you like.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganOfferBetrayalOne.ogg]]

#### VaganOfferBetrayalTwo
When your team has a dud on the roster, you don't keep them around. You give them a kick up the arse and send them packing. Which one here deserves the boot?
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganOfferBetrayalTwo.ogg]]

#### VaganOfferBetrayalThree
A fighter never goes into a fight without knowing everything about his enemies and his allies. I know enough about my friends here to fill a small novel. Care to flick through the pages?
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganOfferBetrayalThree.ogg]]

#### VaganOfferBetrayalFour
Leo's a tough one. He'll understand if we work together to undermine him a bit.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganOfferBetrayalFour.ogg]]

#### VaganOfferBetrayalFive
I'm a fighter, but I fight you face to face. Vorici won't even let you get a weapon out! Best to deal with him now, eh?
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganOfferBetrayalFive.ogg]]

#### VaganOfferBetrayalSix
Guff's greatest achievement is keeping all his rum down. Not exactly one for the history books. A kick in the rear should provide the encouragement he needs.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganOfferBetrayalSix.ogg]]

#### VaganOfferBetrayalSeven
The Redblade's a bit of a firebug, if you hadn't noticed. Arson's not the most constructive of pastimes. With a little encouragement from us, perhaps we can instigate some change.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganOfferBetrayalSeven.ogg]]

#### VaganOfferBetrayalEight
I don't trust that Mutewind, and neither should you. Let's put her in her place while she's... otherwise preoccupied.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganOfferBetrayalEight.ogg]]

#### VaganOfferBetrayalNine
A rough tussle, but I'd rather not lose my head over it. I could, however, bear the loss of another head.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganOfferBetrayalNine.ogg]]

#### VaganOfferExecuteZero
Death's the only option here, I'm afraid.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganOfferExecuteZero.ogg]]

#### VaganOfferExecuteOne
In front of my leader, I can only choose to die.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganOfferExecuteOne.ogg]]

#### VaganOfferExecuteTwo
Stay strong. Death's not that painful... I hope.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganOfferExecuteTwo.ogg]]

#### VaganOfferExecuteThree
Better than being interrogated, I suppose.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganOfferExecuteThree.ogg]]

#### VaganReplyToBetrayalAcceptedZero
Deeply unkind.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganReplyToBetrayalAcceptedZero.ogg]]

#### VaganReplyToBetrayalAcceptedOne
Leo, you unabashed rascal!
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganReplyToBetrayalAcceptedOne.ogg]]

#### VaganReplyToBetrayalAcceptedTwo
Fear a woman scorned, exile.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganReplyToBetrayalAcceptedTwo.ogg]]

#### VaganReplyToBetrayalAcceptedThree
You'd be amazed what a little oil will get you out of.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganReplyToBetrayalAcceptedThree.ogg]]

#### VaganReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFour
She and I could raise some hell together, exile - if only she weren't insane.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFour.ogg]]

#### VaganReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFive
Riker's just jealous.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFive.ogg]]

#### VaganReplyToBetrayalAcceptedSix
A dirty move, but you won't catch me whining.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganReplyToBetrayalAcceptedSix.ogg]]

#### VaganInterrogatedZero
I call foul!
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganInterrogatedZero.ogg]]

#### VaganInterrogatedOne
This is right out of bounds!
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganInterrogatedOne.ogg]]

#### VaganInterrogatedTwo
Can't we bargain again instead? No?
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganInterrogatedTwo.ogg]]

#### VaganReplyToExecutionZero
Was that really necessary?
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganReplyToExecutionZero.ogg]]

#### VaganReplyToExecutionOne
That was my friend!
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganReplyToExecutionOne.ogg]]

#### VaganReplyToExecutionTwo
I'm trying hard to summon up a bit of sorrow here.
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganReplyToExecutionTwo.ogg]]

#### VaganSafehouseLeaderDefeatedZero
A surprise upset!... good show...
![[Vagan, Victory's Herald - VaganSafehouseLeaderDefeatedZero.ogg]]
