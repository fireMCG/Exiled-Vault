## Piety Dialogue
#### PietyIntroCrematorium1
That sombre expression doesn't become those fetching features at all. Cheer up and dance with me!
![[Piety - PietyIntroCrematorium1.ogg]]

#### PietyIntroCrematorium2
My Shadow continues to nip at my heels. [To her attendants] Bag it and tag it, boys and girls.
![[Piety - PietyIntroCrematorium2.ogg]]

#### PietyIntroCrematorium3
A dead man and a living machine. There's your truth, heretic.
![[Piety - PietyIntroCrematorium3.ogg]]

#### PietyIntroCrematorium4
There she is, my work-in-progress. Let's see if Wraeclast has been good to you, Witch.
![[Piety - PietyIntroCrematorium4.ogg]]

#### PietyIntroCrematorium5
You're simply too stupid to be realistic, aren't you, brute?
![[Piety - PietyIntroCrematorium5.ogg]]

#### PietyIntroCrematorium6
Huntress, you are beatific because you answer to no one. And that's why no one will miss you.
![[Piety - PietyIntroCrematorium6.ogg]]

#### PietyIntroCrematorium7
I'm so glad you could make it, my lady. There are answers inside you that I'd like to see.
![[Piety - PietyIntroCrematorium7.ogg]]

#### PietyIntroLunaris1
So you've chosen to end our affair, Duelist? I shall cherish your memory.
![[Piety - PietyIntroLunaris1.ogg]]

#### PietyIntroLunaris2
It's been a grand experiment, Shadow. Time we saw the results.
![[Piety - PietyIntroLunaris2.ogg]]

#### PietyIntroLunaris3
Your conviction drives you, heretic. But have you thought what it might drive others to do in return?
![[Piety - PietyIntroLunaris3.ogg]]

#### PietyIntroLunaris4
Of all the worlds you could have conquered, you had to choose mine. Such power wasted on a feeble imagination.
![[Piety - PietyIntroLunaris4.ogg]]

#### PietyIntroLunaris5
You've done your Ancestors proud, Karui. Now here's your warrior's death!
![[Piety - PietyIntroLunaris5.ogg]]

#### PietyIntroLunaris6
I have pursued a greater existence for us all. What have you ever done but serve yourself?
![[Piety - PietyIntroLunaris6.ogg]]

#### PietyIntroLunaris7
I see it now, wonder child. You are but a reflection. A mirror that I must now break.
![[Piety - PietyIntroLunaris7.ogg]]

#### PietyDeathLunaris
Damn you!

#### PietyIntroPrisonNormal
An Exile here? A shame the warden won't leave anything for me to examine. Make sure you tell our host that Piety of Theopolis sends her regards.
![[Piety - PietyIntroPrisonNormal.ogg]]

#### PietyIntroPrison1
I recognise that pretty face. Grand Arena, Theopolis. I've a future in mind that I think would suit you, Duelist.
![[Piety - PietyIntroPrison1.ogg]]

#### PietyIntroPrison2
Curious. It moves like a killer yet reeks of thaumaturgy. Would that I could observe you more closely, my mysterious Shadow.
![[Piety - PietyIntroPrison2.ogg]]

#### PietyIntroPrison3
Your answer's here, heretic. In Wraeclast. But I don't think you'll like it very much.
![[Piety - PietyIntroPrison3.ogg]]

#### PietyIntroPrison4
Ignorance brought you here, sister. To the one place where your talents are free to grow and be truly feared.
![[Piety - PietyIntroPrison4.ogg]]

#### PietyIntroPrison5
Your brawn is about to meet its match, brute. Give the Warden my regards.
![[Piety - PietyIntroPrison5.ogg]]

#### PietyIntroPrison6
Quite sure of yourself, aren't you, huntress? The Warden enjoys the taste of overconfidence.
![[Piety - PietyIntroPrison6.ogg]]

#### PietyIntroPrison7
The wonder child? I saw you perform for Dominus, girl. You were very good. Good enough to survive Wraeclast? We'll see.
![[Piety - PietyIntroPrison7.ogg]]

#### PietyIntroSpikePassageNormal
Find your own way inland, exile!
![[Piety - PietyIntroSpikePassageNormal.ogg]]

#### PietyIntroSpikePassage1
You're a fine blade in need of forging, Duelist!
![[Piety - PietyIntroSpikePassage1.ogg]]

#### PietyIntroSpikePassage2
It lives! Let's see what else a Shadow can do!
![[Piety - PietyIntroSpikePassage2.ogg]]

#### PietyIntroSpikePassage3
The path to the truth is never a straight one!
![[Piety - PietyIntroSpikePassage3.ogg]]

#### PietyIntroSpikePassage4
This is for your own good, sister!
![[Piety - PietyIntroSpikePassage4.ogg]]

#### PietyIntroSpikePassage5
Strength isn't everything, brute!
![[Piety - PietyIntroSpikePassage5.ogg]]

#### PietyIntroSpikePassage6
This should put a dent in your arrogance, huntress!
![[Piety - PietyIntroSpikePassage6.ogg]]

#### PietyIntroSpikePassage7
If you're ever in Sarn, do drop in, wonder child!
![[Piety - PietyIntroSpikePassage7.ogg]]

#### PietyIntroSins1
Does nothing clench that proud jaw of yours, Duelist? Do share your secret with me some time.
![[Piety - PietyIntroSins1.ogg]]

#### PietyIntroSins2
How is it you thrive when everything I touch turns to dust, Shadow?
![[Piety - PietyIntroSins2.ogg]]

#### PietyIntroSins3
Save your judging gaze, heretic. Though He tests me, my God hasn't abandoned me.
![[Piety - PietyIntroSins3.ogg]]

#### PietyIntroSins4
Failure stings, sister. Yet pain is the finest of all teachers.
![[Piety - PietyIntroSins4.ogg]]

#### PietyIntroSins5
Go and test your sinews against that monstrosity. Perhaps two wrongs can make a right.
![[Piety - PietyIntroSins5.ogg]]

#### PietyIntroSins6
You again? Well, I'm sure you won't be looking so calm once that monstrosity tears you a new orifice.
![[Piety - PietyIntroSins6.ogg]]

#### PietyIntroSins7
Don't forget, Scion. You were born amidst the blood and the screaming, just like me.
![[Piety - PietyIntroSins7.ogg]]

#### PietyCorruptIntro1
Oh Duelist, you're so cute when you're bewildered.
![[Piety - PietyCorruptIntro1.ogg]]

#### PietyCorruptIntro2
Do you assassins offer a money back guarantee, Shadow?
![[Piety - PietyCorruptIntro2.ogg]]

#### PietyCorruptIntro3
You see, heretic? My God takes good care of me.
![[Piety - PietyCorruptIntro3.ogg]]

#### PietyCorruptIntro4
Be happy for me, sister. It's not often we get to erase our failures.
![[Piety - PietyCorruptIntro4.ogg]]

#### PietyCorruptIntro5
You've done well, brute. But let's not get above ourselves.
![[Piety - PietyCorruptIntro5.ogg]]

#### PietyCorruptIntro6
You see what happens when you hunt dreams, Ranger?
![[Piety - PietyCorruptIntro6.ogg]]

#### PietyCorruptIntro7
Who is the wonder child now, Scion?
![[Piety - PietyCorruptIntro7.ogg]]

#### PietyCorruptUntransform1
My beautiful champion. I knew I could rely on you.
![[Piety - PietyCorruptUntransform1.ogg]]

#### PietyCorruptUntransform2
Well done, assassin. Another satisfied customer.
![[Piety - PietyCorruptUntransform2.ogg]]

#### PietyCorruptUntransform3
I may have misjudged that God of yours...
![[Piety - PietyCorruptUntransform3.ogg]]

#### PietyCorruptUntransform4
Our mistakes can be our greatest achievements.
![[Piety - PietyCorruptUntransform4.ogg]]

#### PietyCorruptUntransform5
Kaom wasn't half the man you are, Marauder.
![[Piety - PietyCorruptUntransform5.ogg]]

#### PietyCorruptUntransform6
You've just earned yourself some bigger prey, huntress.
![[Piety - PietyCorruptUntransform6.ogg]]

#### PietyCorruptUntransform7
Let's not make this a habit. It really hurts.
![[Piety - PietyCorruptUntransform7.ogg]]

#### Nightmare
That's twice now that I've experienced a 'little death' with you, Duelist. This time it was just the rude awakening I needed. When we shared our 'moment' back in the Lunaris temple, part of me wishes I'd died at your feet as intended. The little girl within me that shies from darkness, from greatness.
![[Piety - Nightmare.ogg]]

#### Nightmare_2
Stay those mortal instruments of yours, Shadow. I've no wish to test my longevity, nor my sanity, a third time. When we shared our 'moment' back in the Lunaris, part of me wishes I'd died at your feet as intended. The little girl within me that shies from darkness, from greatness.
![[Piety - Nightmare_2.ogg]]

#### Nightmare_3
Twice now you've baptised me in my own blood, Templar. So believe me when I tell you that I've had all the divine revelations that I can stand. When we shared our 'moment' back in the Lunaris, part of me wishes I'd died at your feet as intended. The little girl within me that shies from darkness, from greatness.
![[Piety - Nightmare_3.ogg]]

#### Nightmare_4
That's twice I've underestimated you, sister. Twice now that your talents have proved to exceed even mine. So it looks like you'll be the one to finish what I so blindly started. Part of me wishes I'd died at your feet as was intended. The little girl within me that shies from darkness, from greatness.
![[Piety - Nightmare_4.ogg]]

#### Nightmare_5
There comes a time when brute force is all that we have left. You've proved your worth to me, Karui, twice over. Time you proved it to Wraeclast. Part of me wishes I'd died at your feet as was intended. The little girl within me that shies from darkness, from greatness.
![[Piety - Nightmare_5.ogg]]

#### Nightmare_6
Listen carefully, Ranger, as this is something you will never hear from me again: I was wrong and you were right. Part of me wishes I'd died at your feet as was intended. The little girl within me that shies from darkness, from greatness.
![[Piety - Nightmare_6.ogg]]

#### Nightmare_7
I was always told to respect my 'betters'. Not once did I ever consider taking that advice... until meeting you. Part of me wishes I'd died at your feet as was intended. The little girl within me that shies from darkness, from greatness.
![[Piety - Nightmare_7.ogg]]

#### Malachai
It was Malachai who reached out to me, who wrapped me in Nightmare... made me his slave. He has shown me greatness beyond imagining, so much that I thought my mind would shatter under its weight. And although my mind remains intact, my dreams were not so fortunate. Malachai is in the Beast's black core right now, harnessing all that the Beast is, and will be. He will destroy this world and forge it anew in the divine image of Nightmare. Yet as powerful as Malachai has become, he's neither unreachable nor invulnerable. He sacrificed much to become the Beast's prime servant, both in spirit and in flesh, yet three vital organs remain. His heart, lungs and entrails, keepsakes of humanity lost. They will be our tickets into Malachai's private, little show. Venture deeper, deep into nightmare's abattoir. I'll follow when I'm able. You find me those organs and I'll get us into the Black Core.
![[Piety - Malachai.ogg]]

#### PietyGetOrgans
The Black Core is near. If the Beast were in any way human, we could think of the Black Core as the Beast's heart. I'm not even going to try to explain to you what it really is. Naturally, the Black Core is an 'invites only' party and we're not on the list. Yet I believe I have a way to correct that little oversight. Malachai gave up much of himself when he became the Beast's prime servant. Both in spirit and in flesh. Yet, in a moment of rare sentimentality, he kept a few pieces. Three vital organs, placed in the safe-keeping of his godless three; Inquisitor Maligaro, Shavronne of Umbra and Doedre Darktongue. No doubt you've heard of them on your travels. Bring me those organs and, I promise, I shall get us into the Black Core.

#### Malachai's Organs
You've come such a long way since we first met in Axiom prison. I was that close to snuffing you out, then and there, sister. But now look at us! Working together to destroy the greatest terror that Wraeclast has ever known. If I were the crying type, it'd bring a tear to my eye.
![[Piety - Malachai's Organs.ogg]]

#### Malachai's Organs_2
Fate has a sick sense of humour, doesn't it? When I saw you that day in Axiom Prison, I genuinely thought it'd be for the last time. Yet here we are, the whore and the wonder child, committing a mutual act that will be felt for centuries to come.
![[Piety - Malachai's Organs_2.ogg]]

#### Malachai's Organs_3
I remember when we first crossed paths in Axiom Prison. Logic dictated that you, a feral little girl of the wild, were to die under Brutus' bloody fists. You've proved logic wrong, time and again. Now here you are. Here we are. Defying logic one last time.
![[Piety - Malachai's Organs_3.ogg]]

#### Malachai's Organs_4
You, my champion, have caused me more pain than any other man in my life. Yet do you know from whence my true agony has originated? Not from the violence you have inflicted upon me. I'm a big girl. I can take it. No, it is having to look into those pretty eyes of yours across this chasm of creed that separates us. Until this moment.
![[Piety - Malachai's Organs_4.ogg]]

#### Malachai's Organs_5
So tell me heretic, is yours a compassionate God? I doubt even He has room in his divine heart for such an unusually talented sinner as me. Just so that we're clear about this. I'm not doing this for Him, anyway.
![[Piety - Malachai's Organs_5.ogg]]

#### Malachai's Organs_6
When I met you that first time in Axiom Prison, I thought you a mindless mountain of muscle. I was wrong about you, Karui. So very wrong.
![[Piety - Malachai's Organs_6.ogg]]

#### Malachai's Organs_7
The moment I set eyes on you in Axiom that day, I knew you were something special. Never before had I seen such a perfect balance of physiology and thaumaturgy, Death and Nightmare. A perfect killer.
![[Piety - Malachai's Organs_7.ogg]]

#### Malachai's Organs_8
Before we walk this path together, it's important that you understand one thing about me. I don't regret a single thing that I've done. I set out to raise humanity up from the cloying mud of its fleshly ignorance. My mistake was not in the aspiration, but in the execution. Now I intend to correct that mistake. Really, I'm not helping you, exile. You're helping me. So, have you found those juicy organs for me yet?
![[Piety - Malachai's Organs_8.ogg]]

#### The Godless Three
Malachai chose his three most loyal servants to guard those precious innards. His Godless Three. Inquisitor Maligaro, Shavronne of Umbra, and Doedre Darktongue. If the history books are accurate, High Templar Voll burned Maligaro and Doedre at the stake on his way to lay siege to Sarn. He didn't have to worry himself with Shavronne. Brutus had already sorted her out. Yet slaves of nightmare seem to be shackled just as tightly to life as they are to the Beast. I, of course, am living proof of that. Don't worry yourself with that little detail, though. Shackles are made to be unlocked.
![[Piety - The Godless Three.ogg]]

#### Malachai's Organs_9
You work fast! You know, it is no mere 'freak of nightmare' that fashioned that monstrous version of myself, the one you so kindly despatched. The Godless Three took great pains in getting me looking... 'just so'. They were none too gentle about it either. So no need to play softly with the remaining two. Treat kindness with kindness.
![[Piety - Malachai's Organs_9.ogg]]

#### Malachai's Organs_10
Good! Two down, one to go. You know, prior to meeting Maligaro, Shavronne and Doedre, I rather admired them. Their work, their accomplishments... sheer genius! As it turns out, genius is something better appreciated from afar. So let's remove this one, last genius from the vicinity, shall we?
![[Piety - Malachai's Organs_10.ogg]]

#### PietyDelivered3OrganCommon
Excellent work! Now Malachai awaits us within that Black Core, blissful in his ignorance as he puts the finishing touches on his Awakening Engine. It's time we showed him a few finishing touches of our own. Would you care to do the honours?
![[Piety - PietyDelivered3OrganCommon.ogg]]

#### Malachai_2
Malachai knew exactly what he was doing when he created the Rapture. His primary concern... get inside the Beast and take up the reins of true power. And his second objective... incite a Cataclysm that would wipe the very thought of resistance from this land. The Beast is the source of all thaumaturgy, the one power in this world that transforms 'what is real' into 'what is imagined'. The entire world is now at the mercy of one man's vision. It won't be the future I imagined, and it won't be the future you imagined, either. While he remains within the Black Core, the only imagination that matters... is Malachai's.
![[Piety - Malachai_2.ogg]]

#### PietyMalachaiDeath1
This is what I get for trying to be a bloody hero. An honest death... the only redemption I was ever likely to get. You know, it's a question that's always haunted me... whose will be the last face I see. I like the answer. Go, my pretty champion. I want that fine arse of yours to be the last thing I see.
![[Piety - PietyMalachaiDeath1.ogg]]

#### PietyMalachaiDeath2
This is what I get for trying to be a bloody hero. Just before you murdered me in the Lunaris, Shadow, I thought you were about to steal my destiny from me. As it turns out, you gave me back my freedom. So go on, shadow boy, and do what you do best. Murder Malachai.
![[Piety - PietyMalachaiDeath2.ogg]]

#### PietyMalachaiDeath3
This is what I get for trying to be a bloody saviour. I've seen, felt... been things that you can't imagine, heretic, and I don't regret a damned moment of it. So go. Finish what we started. And when I find out if this God of yours is real or not, I'll be sure to let you know.
![[Piety - PietyMalachaiDeath3.ogg]]

#### PietyMalachaiDeath4
This is what I get for trying to be a bloody hero. Who'd have thought you'd be so suited to the role? I was convinced I'd made a fatal mistake in sparing your life in Axiom Prison. Fatal, yes, but a mistake? No. Go now, sister. It's up to you to teach Malachai the true definition of Nightmare.
![[Piety - PietyMalachaiDeath4.ogg]]

#### PietyMalachaiDeath5
This is what I get for trying to be a bloody hero. I was so sure that I was creating a prouder world, and I thought the Karui beneath such a future. I was wrong. Leave me, Marauder. I've got some explaining to do... to my Ancestors. You go and honour Malachai's head with a place on your belt.
![[Piety - PietyMalachaiDeath5.ogg]]

#### PietyMalachaiDeath6
You... you were born for this. But you've always known that, haven't you. I've strived my whole life to make something better, of the world, of myself. You have simply lived, and the irony is, that's all that either of us ever needed to do. So go, finish the hunt, Ranger. Do what comes so naturally to you.
![[Piety - PietyMalachaiDeath6.ogg]]

#### PietyMalachaiDeath7
This is what I get for trying to be a bloody hero. Not that long ago, you represented all that I hated. But there you stand, possessing the one thing I have always dreamed of. A chance to change the world. Go on then. I've played my part. I asked the difficult questions. Now it's up to you to get the answers.
![[Piety - PietyMalachaiDeath7.ogg]]

#### PietyBreakFree1
Now, exile!
![[Piety - PietyBreakFree1.ogg]]

#### PietyEnthrall
Kill me!
![[Piety - PietyEnthrall.ogg]]
