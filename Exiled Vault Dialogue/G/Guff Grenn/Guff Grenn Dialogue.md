#### GuffSecondaryDefenderArrivalTen
Oi oi! Well, your captain has arrived.
![[Guff Grenn - GuffSecondaryDefenderArrivalTen.ogg]]

#### GuffSecondaryDefenderArrivalEleven
So your big spooky mask didn't scare 'em off Riker? What a bloody surprise.
![[Guff Grenn - GuffSecondaryDefenderArrivalEleven.ogg]]

#### GuffSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwelve
Gotta throw a wrench in the works here. Sorry. I got aims.
![[Guff Grenn - GuffSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwelve.ogg]]

#### GuffSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirteen
I told ye this day would come, ya warthog-faced buffoon! Oh, hello, Exile.
![[Guff Grenn - GuffSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirteen.ogg]]

#### GuffSecondaryDefenderArrivalFourteen
Someone is getting a beating, believe me!
![[Guff Grenn - GuffSecondaryDefenderArrivalFourteen.ogg]]

#### GuffSecondaryDefenderArrivalFifteen
Add one blustering bloodthirsty Brinerot to the mix!
![[Guff Grenn - GuffSecondaryDefenderArrivalFifteen.ogg]]

#### GuffSecondaryDefenderArrivalSixteen
All that time spent surveying the land, Tora, and the real threat was comin' from the seas!
![[Guff Grenn - GuffSecondaryDefenderArrivalSixteen.ogg]]

#### GuffSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeventeen
Ah, I could never be mad at ya Janus. This is nothing personal.
![[Guff Grenn - GuffSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeventeen.ogg]]

#### GuffSecondaryDefenderArrivalEighteen
Ogham ain't gonna miss ya, Thane, and neither will I.
![[Guff Grenn - GuffSecondaryDefenderArrivalEighteen.ogg]]

#### GuffSecondaryDefenderArrivalNineteen
Say yer prayers, ya sulfur-smellin' sack o' shite.
![[Guff Grenn - GuffSecondaryDefenderArrivalNineteen.ogg]]

#### GuffSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwenty
Ya didn't see this one comin', did ya, ya hoity-toity trollop?
![[Guff Grenn - GuffSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwenty.ogg]]

#### GuffSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyOne
Guff here is makin' a play, so have at ya!
![[Guff Grenn - GuffSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyOne.ogg]]

#### GuffReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero
Oh, Exile, this one's bum's out the window. They're right crazy.
![[Guff Grenn - GuffReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero.ogg]]

#### GuffReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne
Piss off and boil yer head!
![[Guff Grenn - GuffReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne.ogg]]

#### GuffReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo
The Syndicate needs this done, and you're gonna foozle the whole affair!
![[Guff Grenn - GuffReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo.ogg]]

#### GuffReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree
Ah, well, ya know what they say: a numpty a day keeps victory away.
![[Guff Grenn - GuffReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree.ogg]]

#### GuffReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour
Ahem. Vagan.
![[Guff Grenn - GuffReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour.ogg]]

#### GuffReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive
Then you're about to sink... like an anchor, ya plenary whiffle-whaffle!
![[Guff Grenn - GuffReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive.ogg]]

#### GuffReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix
Wow! Bordering on potomania with that one. Or pyromania, I forget which. Off your hide, either way.
![[Guff Grenn - GuffReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix.ogg]]

#### GuffReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven
Oh and I'd find a way to drag you down with me, ya bloody scobberlotcher.
![[Guff Grenn - GuffReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven.ogg]]

#### GuffReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight
Agh, why are ya pickin' on Guff?
![[Guff Grenn - GuffReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight.ogg]]

#### GuffSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyTwo
It's the one-two punch of doom!
![[Guff Grenn - GuffSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyTwo.ogg]]

#### GuffSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyThree
Now, we'll get the job done for sure.
![[Guff Grenn - GuffSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyThree.ogg]]

#### GuffSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFour
Aw, quicker now, the gaffer's here!
![[Guff Grenn - GuffSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFour.ogg]]

#### GuffSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFive
This one's knicked for sure now.
![[Guff Grenn - GuffSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFive.ogg]]

#### GuffSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySix
I command who? Ha-ku! That's you!
![[Guff Grenn - GuffSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySix.ogg]]

#### GuffSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySeven
Oi Janus, guess what? I'm the baaawss!
![[Guff Grenn - GuffSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySeven.ogg]]

#### GuffSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyEight
Ha hah! A Brinerot captainin' a Redblade. Today's the day!
![[Guff Grenn - GuffSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyEight.ogg]]

#### GuffSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyNine
Don't shoot me, but I do enjoy lording over a Mutewind.
![[Guff Grenn - GuffSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyNine.ogg]]

#### GuffSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirty
Riker, if you goof here, you are showing me what's under that mask.
![[Guff Grenn - GuffSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirty.ogg]]

#### GuffSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirtyOne
It's Guff to friends, Captain to the rest!
![[Guff Grenn - GuffSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirtyOne.ogg]]

#### GuffKillPlayerZero
Thank the gods... I mean, totally had that one under control the whole time.
![[Guff Grenn - GuffKillPlayerZero.ogg]]

#### GuffKillPlayerOne
Brinerot property remains Brinerot property!
![[Guff Grenn - GuffKillPlayerOne.ogg]]

#### GuffKillPlayerTwo
Oof, not a pretty place to fall. I know I wouldn't want to rest here.
![[Guff Grenn - GuffKillPlayerTwo.ogg]]

#### GuffKillPlayerThree
Never doubted... for a second... that I could do it!
![[Guff Grenn - GuffKillPlayerThree.ogg]]

#### GuffEscapeZero
Well this worked out rather nicely for Guff.
![[Guff Grenn - GuffEscapeZero.ogg]]

#### GuffEscapeOne
Captain Guff Gren escapes again!
![[Guff Grenn - GuffEscapeOne.ogg]]

#### GuffEscapeTwo
Ahahahah! Yes!
![[Guff Grenn - GuffEscapeTwo.ogg]]

#### GuffDefeatedZero
Ohh, oh, me kidney...
![[Guff Grenn - GuffDefeatedZero.ogg]]

#### GuffDefeatedOne
My spleen, my poor spleen!
![[Guff Grenn - GuffDefeatedOne.ogg]]

#### GuffDefeatedTwo
Acch, ya got me in the lung...
![[Guff Grenn - GuffDefeatedTwo.ogg]]

#### GuffDefeatedThree
Ow! Ah ah ah ow! You hit me in the eyeball! Why the eyeball, Exile?
![[Guff Grenn - GuffDefeatedThree.ogg]]

#### GuffDefeatedFour
Not back to the bin? Ugh.
![[Guff Grenn - GuffDefeatedFour.ogg]]

#### GuffDefeatedFive
Guess I was better as a merchant than a fighter.
![[Guff Grenn - GuffDefeatedFive.ogg]]

#### GuffDefeatedSix
You gonna make me turn traitor again? 'Cause I - 'cause I will.
![[Guff Grenn - GuffDefeatedSix.ogg]]

#### GuffDefeatedSeven
My head just keeps trying to leave me shoulders!
![[Guff Grenn - GuffDefeatedSeven.ogg]]

#### GuffDefeatedEight
Well, look as us aye! Back and forth, forth and back.
![[Guff Grenn - GuffDefeatedEight.ogg]]

#### GuffDefeatedNine
I should never have jumped in like that. Aye... not great thinking.
![[Guff Grenn - GuffDefeatedNine.ogg]]

#### GuffDefeatedTen
Well, this is what I get for sticking me nose in!
![[Guff Grenn - GuffDefeatedTen.ogg]]

#### GuffOfferBargainZero
Whoah ha hah ho, hohoho, oh! No, no. No, I am ready to do whatever you say.
![[Guff Grenn - GuffOfferBargainZero.ogg]]

#### GuffOfferBargainOne
Lemme recruit a numpty to this job. It's an old pirate trick. You attack when the worst man is on watch. Yeah. Yeah, makes it easy. So whaddya think?
![[Guff Grenn - GuffOfferBargainOne.ogg]]

#### GuffOfferBargainTwo
Well, I can make friends, yeah, find things out. Everybody loves ol' Guff! You get information, I get to live. Yeah. So whaddya say?
![[Guff Grenn - GuffOfferBargainTwo.ogg]]

#### GuffOfferBargainThree
Well I'm just no good at this job, so, how about you let me live, and I use me 'charm' to switch with someone else? Yeah. Yeah, that would let you reorganise things for your own ends...
![[Guff Grenn - GuffOfferBargainThree.ogg]]

#### GuffOfferBargainFour
That's it! I'm done! I'm out! Yep. I've had enough! This whole damn Syndicate's full of braindead... beetroots. Let me walk, Exile!
![[Guff Grenn - GuffOfferBargainFour.ogg]]

#### GuffOfferBargainFive
Now I'm no clipe, but sometimes, talking is better than, you know, dying. So just give lil' ol' Guff a chance to jabber and I guarantee you'll learn a thing or two.
![[Guff Grenn - GuffOfferBargainFive.ogg]]

#### GuffOfferBargainSix
I got treasure for ya, you know, if you look the other way, friend...
![[Guff Grenn - GuffOfferBargainSix.ogg]]

#### GuffBargainAcceptedZero
Good choice, Exile. Yep. You won't regret this.
![[Guff Grenn - GuffBargainAcceptedZero.ogg]]

#### GuffBargainAcceptedOne
I am on the job!
![[Guff Grenn - GuffBargainAcceptedOne.ogg]]

#### GuffBargainAcceptedTwo
Next time you see me, I'll be a new man.
![[Guff Grenn - GuffBargainAcceptedTwo.ogg]]

#### GuffBargainAcceptedThree
Goodbye forever, friend - well, least 'til next time!
![[Guff Grenn - GuffBargainAcceptedThree.ogg]]

#### GuffBargainAcceptedFour
There it is, eh? That's the sense I was hoping for. Now let's talk.
![[Guff Grenn - GuffBargainAcceptedFour.ogg]]

#### GuffBargainAcceptedFive
All that glitters is gold...
![[Guff Grenn - GuffBargainAcceptedFive.ogg]]

#### GuffOfferBetrayalZero
My gaffer's in a weak position, mutiny-wise. If you take mercy on me, I might just manage to, uh, depose 'em. Keen?
![[Guff Grenn - GuffOfferBetrayalZero.ogg]]

#### GuffOfferBetrayalOne
What if I told you I could spin a yarn and get all me mates demoted? That would be worth keeping me alive for that, right? Right?
![[Guff Grenn - GuffOfferBetrayalOne.ogg]]

#### GuffOfferBetrayalTwo
Would ya care to kick one of me mates entirely out of the Syndicate? It's a big lie I can tell, but one I will get away with, mostly. You know, as long as you don't lop my head off!
![[Guff Grenn - GuffOfferBetrayalTwo.ogg]]

#### GuffOfferBetrayalThree
They don't call me gobermouch for nothing. I've got gossip and the low-down on everyone here. Just ah... just give me a chance to jabber on.
![[Guff Grenn - GuffOfferBetrayalThree.ogg]]

#### GuffOfferBetrayalFour
Tora's so busy worrying about bloody trees and worms and... mice, she doesn't even see the rest of us bustin' our behinds to push the Syndicate forward. Let's give Tora somethin' to really worry about!
![[Guff Grenn - GuffOfferBetrayalFour.ogg]]

#### GuffOfferBetrayalFive
Jorgin is a murderer, or he hired one. He's way worse than me. If you are punishing me over him, then you're dumber than the barnacles on me backside.
![[Guff Grenn - GuffOfferBetrayalFive.ogg]]

#### GuffOfferBetrayalSix
Well! Can't never trust a Redblade, I always say. And I alway mean it, too.
![[Guff Grenn - GuffOfferBetrayalSix.ogg]]

#### GuffOfferBetrayalSeven
Trustin' a Mutewind 'll get ya pincushioned by hidden blades, and I be speakin' from experience here.
![[Guff Grenn - GuffOfferBetrayalSeven.ogg]]

#### GuffOfferBetrayalEight
I like Maloney, okay, don't get me wrong, but did ya ever have a mate who you could tell was just... after something? You know, makes me skin crawl, it does. Losing sleep over it! Really would rather not have to even think about it.
![[Guff Grenn - GuffOfferBetrayalEight.ogg]]

#### GuffOfferBetrayalNine
Haha awww, you know I didn't mean nothing by it! I'm not even the one you really want, right?
![[Guff Grenn - GuffOfferBetrayalNine.ogg]]

#### GuffOfferExecuteZero
Just do it, ya git.
![[Guff Grenn - GuffOfferExecuteZero.ogg]]

#### GuffOfferExecuteOne
Watch carefully, gaffer. I give my life for the Syndicate.
![[Guff Grenn - GuffOfferExecuteOne.ogg]]

#### GuffOfferExecuteTwo
I'm goin' out first, let me show you how it's done!
![[Guff Grenn - GuffOfferExecuteTwo.ogg]]

#### GuffOfferExecuteThree
I would rather die than go another round with your torture chamber.
![[Guff Grenn - GuffOfferExecuteThree.ogg]]

#### GuffReplyToBetrayalAcceptedZero
Ooh, that is not good for my prospects.
![[Guff Grenn - GuffReplyToBetrayalAcceptedZero.ogg]]

#### GuffReplyToBetrayalAcceptedOne
Do you want to kick my rear, Vagan, or bend it?
![[Guff Grenn - GuffReplyToBetrayalAcceptedOne.ogg]]

#### GuffReplyToBetrayalAcceptedTwo
Believe me, Janus, no one's tryin' to do nothing to your booty.
![[Guff Grenn - GuffReplyToBetrayalAcceptedTwo.ogg]]

#### GuffReplyToBetrayalAcceptedThree
Ya know what? I think he could make a fence post out of me, too.
![[Guff Grenn - GuffReplyToBetrayalAcceptedThree.ogg]]

#### GuffReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFour
Keep your sedition to yourself, you overgrown gobermouch!
![[Guff Grenn - GuffReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFour.ogg]]

#### GuffReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFive
Oh, you done foozled it now, Mutewind!
![[Guff Grenn - GuffReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFive.ogg]]

#### GuffReplyToBetrayalAcceptedSix
Why do I always get the short end of the stick?
![[Guff Grenn - GuffReplyToBetrayalAcceptedSix.ogg]]

#### GuffInterrogatedZero
I'm a talker, yes, but you will have to get me drunk first!
![[Guff Grenn - GuffInterrogatedZero.ogg]]

#### GuffInterrogatedOne
Stop locking me up!
![[Guff Grenn - GuffInterrogatedOne.ogg]]

#### GuffInterrogatedTwo
Wait, wait, what happened to our dealing? We - we were gettin' on fine!
![[Guff Grenn - GuffInterrogatedTwo.ogg]]

#### GuffReplyToExecutionZero
Ohh, not pretty. Ooh, that's not pretty at all.
![[Guff Grenn - GuffReplyToExecutionZero.ogg]]

#### GuffReplyToExecutionOne
Auggh, was me best mate!
![[Guff Grenn - GuffReplyToExecutionOne.ogg]]

#### GuffReplyToExecutionTwo
Welp, no love lost there, let me tell ya.
![[Guff Grenn - GuffReplyToExecutionTwo.ogg]]

#### GuffSafehouseLeaderDefeatedZero
Oh boy, hoo, Guff's done it now.
![[Guff Grenn - GuffSafehouseLeaderDefeatedZero.ogg]]
