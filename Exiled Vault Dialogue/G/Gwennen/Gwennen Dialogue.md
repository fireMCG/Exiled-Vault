## Gwennen Dialogue
#### GamblerCurrencyVeryLowMagicRarityEquipment
No risk, no reward.
![[Gwennen - GamblerCurrencyVeryLowMagicRarityEquipment.ogg]]

#### GamblerCurrencyVeryLowRareRarityEquipment
That might be useful?
![[Gwennen - GamblerCurrencyVeryLowRareRarityEquipment.ogg]]

#### GamblerCurrencyUniqueCommentOne
It's not nothing, at least!
![[Gwennen - GamblerCurrencyUniqueCommentOne.ogg]]

#### GamblerCurrencyUniqueCommentTwo
That's something!
![[Gwennen - GamblerCurrencyUniqueCommentTwo.ogg]]

#### GamblerCurrencyUniqueCommentThree
That looks intriguing!
![[Gwennen - GamblerCurrencyUniqueCommentThree.ogg]]

#### GamblerCurrencyUniqueCommentFour
You believed, and your belief paid off!
![[Gwennen - GamblerCurrencyUniqueCommentFour.ogg]]

#### GamblerCurrencyVeryLowDivineUniqueCommentOne
Wow! I don't know what to make of that at all! But at least you got it cheap!
![[Gwennen - GamblerCurrencyVeryLowDivineUniqueCommentOne.ogg]]

#### GamblerCurrencyVeryLowHeadhunter
Congratulations! You hit the jackpot! I always knew you'd get lucky!
![[Gwennen - GamblerCurrencyVeryLowHeadhunter.ogg]]

#### GamblerCurrencyVeryLowEquipmentSpecialLow
Curious... at least you didn't pay much for it.
![[Gwennen - GamblerCurrencyVeryLowEquipmentSpecialLow.ogg]]

#### GamblerCurrencyVeryLowEquipmentSpecialMid
A decent payoff, I'd say.
![[Gwennen - GamblerCurrencyVeryLowEquipmentSpecialMid.ogg]]

#### GamblerCurrencyVeryLowEquipmentSpecialHigh
Quite the interesting piece of equipment, that! And it came cheap!
![[Gwennen - GamblerCurrencyVeryLowEquipmentSpecialHigh.ogg]]

#### GamblerCurrencyLowMagicRarityEquipment
You get what you pay for, I suppose!
![[Gwennen - GamblerCurrencyLowMagicRarityEquipment.ogg]]

#### GamblerCurrencyLowRareRarityEquipment
At least it's pretty.
![[Gwennen - GamblerCurrencyLowRareRarityEquipment.ogg]]

#### GamblerCurrencyUniqueCommentFive
Hmm. Might be useful in certain situations.
![[Gwennen - GamblerCurrencyUniqueCommentFive.ogg]]

#### GamblerCurrencyUniqueCommentSix
A decent prize!
![[Gwennen - GamblerCurrencyUniqueCommentSix.ogg]]

#### GamblerCurrencyLowDivineUniqueCommentTwo
Glad you've taken that off my hands. I don't like it.
![[Gwennen - GamblerCurrencyLowDivineUniqueCommentTwo.ogg]]

#### GamblerCurrencyLowHeadhunter
Amazing! I really should have charged more for that one!
![[Gwennen - GamblerCurrencyLowHeadhunter.ogg]]

#### GamblerCurrencyLowEquipmentSpecialLow
Low risk, strange equipment. Just another day of gambling.
![[Gwennen - GamblerCurrencyLowEquipmentSpecialLow.ogg]]

#### GamblerCurrencyLowEquipmentSpecialMid
How intriguing! And it didn't cost you much, either.
![[Gwennen - GamblerCurrencyLowEquipmentSpecialMid.ogg]]

#### GamblerCurrencyLowEquipmentSpecialHigh
Now that's a decent payoff!
![[Gwennen - GamblerCurrencyLowEquipmentSpecialHigh.ogg]]

#### GamblerCurrencyMediumMagicRarityEquipment
Better luck next time.
![[Gwennen - GamblerCurrencyMediumMagicRarityEquipment.ogg]]

#### GamblerCurrencyMediumRareRarityEquipment
You never know with that kind of equipment. Maybe somebody will trade you for it.
![[Gwennen - GamblerCurrencyMediumRareRarityEquipment.ogg]]

#### GamblerCurrencyUniqueCommentSeven
I'm not sensing excitement from you on this one.
![[Gwennen - GamblerCurrencyUniqueCommentSeven.ogg]]

#### GamblerCurrencyUniqueCommentEight
That looks very nice.
![[Gwennen - GamblerCurrencyUniqueCommentEight.ogg]]

#### GamblerCurrencyMediumDivineUniqueCommentThree
Artifacts related to these 'gods' of yours make me wary...
![[Gwennen - GamblerCurrencyMediumDivineUniqueCommentThree.ogg]]

#### GamblerCurrencyMediumHeadhunter
Yes! You did it! Luck favours you this day!
![[Gwennen - GamblerCurrencyMediumHeadhunter.ogg]]

#### GamblerCurrencyMediumEquipmentSpecialLow
Wraeclast has such strange equipment...
![[Gwennen - GamblerCurrencyMediumEquipmentSpecialLow.ogg]]

#### GamblerCurrencyMediumEquipmentSpecialMid
Looks like your belief in luck paid off.
![[Gwennen - GamblerCurrencyMediumEquipmentSpecialMid.ogg]]

#### GamblerCurrencyMediumEquipmentSpecialHigh
You're getting good at gambling!
![[Gwennen - GamblerCurrencyMediumEquipmentSpecialHigh.ogg]]

#### GamblerCurrencyHighMagicRarityEquipment
Ouch.
![[Gwennen - GamblerCurrencyHighMagicRarityEquipment.ogg]]

#### GamblerCurrencyHighRareRarityEquipment
You really must believe harder.
![[Gwennen - GamblerCurrencyHighRareRarityEquipment.ogg]]

#### GamblerCurrencyUniqueCommentNine
...neat.
![[Gwennen - GamblerCurrencyUniqueCommentNine.ogg]]

#### GamblerCurrencyUniqueCommentTen
Hmm. Expensive risk you took, but this might be... something?
![[Gwennen - GamblerCurrencyUniqueCommentTen.ogg]]

#### GamblerCurrencyHighDivineUniqueCommentFour
Are you sure this 'divine' gear is worth what you paid for it?
![[Gwennen - GamblerCurrencyHighDivineUniqueCommentFour.ogg]]

#### GamblerCurrencyHighHeadhunter
That seems rather useful, to put it mildly!
![[Gwennen - GamblerCurrencyHighHeadhunter.ogg]]

#### GamblerCurrencyHighEquipmentSpecialLow
Strange equipment at high prices. That's the beauty of gambling.
![[Gwennen - GamblerCurrencyHighEquipmentSpecialLow.ogg]]

#### GamblerCurrencyHighEquipmentSpecialMid
Not bad for the risk you took.
![[Gwennen - GamblerCurrencyHighEquipmentSpecialMid.ogg]]

#### GamblerCurrencyHighEquipmentSpecialHigh
High risk, high reward!
![[Gwennen - GamblerCurrencyHighEquipmentSpecialHigh.ogg]]

#### GamblerCurrencyVeryHighHeadhunter
Did you just squeal with joy?
![[Gwennen - GamblerCurrencyVeryHighHeadhunter.ogg]]

#### GamblerCurrencyVeryHighRareLeatherBeltWithLife
You didn't believe hard enough. Better luck next time.
![[Gwennen - GamblerCurrencyVeryHighRareLeatherBeltWithLife.ogg]]

#### GwennenTutorialShout
You there! Local! Come here!
![[Gwennen - GwennenTutorialShout.ogg]]

#### Unearthing the Past
I bet a yokel like yourself would be eager to see some explosions. Nevermind why we're blowing things up just yet. We'll get to that. I've gone ahead and marked the locations of likely treasures and dangers. Consider me magnanimous. You can choose what we uncover, since I'm eager to see what kind of luck you possess. I'll wait back here. As far back as possible. Lay out a chain of devices. We'll make a mighty fine display.
![[Gwennen - Unearthing the Past.ogg]]

#### GwennenTutorialPlayerPlacesFirstExplosive
Try to go as far as you can with the detonation cord.
![[Gwennen - GwennenTutorialPlayerPlacesFirstExplosive.ogg]]

#### GwennenTutorialPlayerWalksTooFarAway
Not that far!
![[Gwennen - GwennenTutorialPlayerWalksTooFarAway.ogg]]

#### GwennenTutorialPlayerPlacesSecondExplosive
Further! Keep going. Away from me.
![[Gwennen - GwennenTutorialPlayerPlacesSecondExplosive.ogg]]

#### GwennenTutorialPlayerPlacesThirdExplosive
All placed. Shall we light it up?
![[Gwennen - GwennenTutorialPlayerPlacesThirdExplosive.ogg]]

#### GwennenTutorialDetonating
I should also mention... this might unearth monsters!
![[Gwennen - GwennenTutorialDetonating.ogg]]

#### GwennenTutorialMonstersAppearing
You can take 'em!
![[Gwennen - GwennenTutorialMonstersAppearing.ogg]]

#### GwennenTutorialMoreMonstersAppearing
Go get 'em, local!
![[Gwennen - GwennenTutorialMoreMonstersAppearing.ogg]]

#### GwennenTutorialAllMonstersDead
You did it?... you did it! Most of the locals I grab for this job don't last long.
![[Gwennen - GwennenTutorialAllMonstersDead.ogg]]

#### The Successful Job
Hah, yes, I could have been more up front about the danger... but you see, people don't take the job when I mention that the upturned ground is full of deadly creatures. It's a mighty awful land you've got here, local. A wonder anyone survives at all. Though that does speak to why I'm here in the first place... but you'll have to ask Dannig about that, if you find him. By the way, if you enjoy a bit of risk, I've got a few things I've unearthed that might be of interest to you...
![[Gwennen - The Successful Job.ogg]]

#### GwennenTutorialPartingShoutForTutorialTwo
If you see Tujen, tell him I sent you!
![[Gwennen - GwennenTutorialPartingShoutForTutorialTwo.ogg]]

#### GwennenTutorialPartingShout
I'll finish up here. See you again soon!
![[Gwennen - GwennenTutorialPartingShout.ogg]]

#### GwennenTutorialTwoShout
Found something special for you here, local!
![[Gwennen - GwennenTutorialTwoShout.ogg]]

#### Explosive Archaeology
Remnants of ancient civilisations abound on this continent. Apparently, some of the remnants still hold mysterious influences. It's a bit of a risk to destroy one and release its energies, but the reward could be worth it. Everything unearthed after a remnant is destroyed comes up a little different. Why don't you place an explosive device near that one over there? Let's see what happens.
![[Gwennen - Explosive Archaeology.ogg]]

#### GwennenTutorialPlayerPlacesExplosiveNotNearRemnant
Place an explosive near the remnant!
![[Gwennen - GwennenTutorialPlayerPlacesExplosiveNotNearRemnant.ogg]]

#### GwennenTutorialTwoFailure
This placement of explosives won't scratch that remnant at all! Oh well, we'll try again later.
![[Gwennen - GwennenTutorialTwoFailure.ogg]]

#### GwennenTutorialPlayerPlacesExplosiveNearRemnant
Good, that'll do it.
![[Gwennen - GwennenTutorialPlayerPlacesExplosiveNearRemnant.ogg]]

#### GwennenTutorialEnragedMonstersAppearing
I should also mention... this might enrage the monsters!
![[Gwennen - GwennenTutorialEnragedMonstersAppearing.ogg]]

#### GwennenTutorialTwoAllMonstersDead
There you go, exile! Destroying remnants is a risky endeavour but you can clearly handle it.
![[Gwennen - GwennenTutorialTwoAllMonstersDead.ogg]]

#### Risky Remnants
So it seems destroying ancient remnants alters everything we subsequently unearth, treasures and monsters both. It's a gamble, and you know I'm always up for that. So long as you're ready to handle the consequences... with violence.
![[Gwennen - Risky Remnants.ogg]]

#### Introduction
Now that we've a chance to talk without explosives and monsters around us... I'm Gwennen. Luck is my game. But it's no game. It's deadly serious. You have to believe you're going to win, or you won't. That's the nature of this life, understand? It is what you make of it. So when you gamble with me, know that it's your fault if you lose. You just didn't believe hard enough.
![[Gwennen - Introduction.ogg]]

#### Introduction_2
You're a woman of ironclad determination. I can tell. I'm Gwennen. I've got something I fervently believe in as well, but my religion is luck. I've run headlong into danger because it was what {I} wanted to do, any orders be damned, and I bet it's the same for you. When your actions and beliefs align, you can do anything. Even win at gambling. Which I bet you'll do. Care to try your luck?
![[Gwennen - Introduction_2.ogg]]

#### Introduction_3
I can recognise a man of faith on any continent. I'm Gwennen. I'm dedicated to a cause, like you, but my religion is luck. I've gotten through deadly situations I had no right surviving simply because I {knew} I would. I assume it's the same for you and your prayers. This life is what we make of it. I bet I'm going to lose on our transactions, since you're going to pray while you gamble. I don't consider it cheating. I consider it admirable. We'll get on just fine.
![[Gwennen - Introduction_3.ogg]]

#### GwennenRerollInventoryRandom
I've got a few more.
![[Gwennen - GwennenRerollInventoryRandom.ogg]]

#### GwennenRerollInventory4
Maybe I'll just shuffle these around and tell you they're different.
![[Gwennen - GwennenRerollInventory4.ogg]]

#### GwennenRerollInventory7
What else do I have? Hmm...
![[Gwennen - GwennenRerollInventory7.ogg]]

#### GwennenRerollInventory10
How about these?
![[Gwennen - GwennenRerollInventory10.ogg]]

#### GwennenRerollInventory14
Here's some new ones.
![[Gwennen - GwennenRerollInventory14.ogg]]

#### GwennenRerollInventory17
Looking for something in particular?
![[Gwennen - GwennenRerollInventory17.ogg]]

#### GwennenRerollInventory21
Here's another pack-full.
![[Gwennen - GwennenRerollInventory21.ogg]]

#### GwennenRerollInventory25
I've always got more!
![[Gwennen - GwennenRerollInventory25.ogg]]

#### GwennenApproachShoutRandom
Hello again, local!
![[Gwennen - GwennenApproachShoutRandom.ogg]]

#### GwennenApproachShout4
It's my lucky day!
![[Gwennen - GwennenApproachShout4.ogg]]

#### GwennenApproachShout7
Finally! Come on!
![[Gwennen - GwennenApproachShout7.ogg]]

#### GwennenDetonatingRandom
I've got this!
![[Gwennen - GwennenDetonatingRandom.ogg]]

#### GwennenOrderHirelingDetonateRandom
Hit it!
![[Gwennen - GwennenOrderHirelingDetonateRandom.ogg]]

#### GwennenBombPlacedGenericRandom
Lucky guess.
![[Gwennen - GwennenBombPlacedGenericRandom.ogg]]

#### GwennenBombPlacedMonstersRandom
In for a fight, then.
![[Gwennen - GwennenBombPlacedMonstersRandom.ogg]]

#### GwennenBombPlacedMonsters4
Are you waking the dead on purpose?
![[Gwennen - GwennenBombPlacedMonsters4.ogg]]

#### GwennenBombPlacedMonsters7
Here we go...
![[Gwennen - GwennenBombPlacedMonsters7.ogg]]

#### GwennenBombPlacedRiskRandom
Yes! Add some spice!
![[Gwennen - GwennenBombPlacedRiskRandom.ogg]]

#### GwennenBombPlacedRisk4
Gambling with our lives? Hahaha!
![[Gwennen - GwennenBombPlacedRisk4.ogg]]

#### GwennenBombPlacedRisk5
Gambling with our lives? Haha!
![[Gwennen - GwennenBombPlacedRisk5.ogg]]

#### GwennenBombPlacedRisk6
Gambling with our lives! Haha!
![[Gwennen - GwennenBombPlacedRisk6.ogg]]

#### GwennenBombPlacedRisk7
I always love a good risk.
![[Gwennen - GwennenBombPlacedRisk7.ogg]]

#### GwennenBombPlacedTreasureRandom
I'm never against treasure.
![[Gwennen - GwennenBombPlacedTreasureRandom.ogg]]

#### GwennenBombPlacedTreasure4
There could be anything in that treasure!
![[Gwennen - GwennenBombPlacedTreasure4.ogg]]

#### GwennenBombPlacedTreasure7
Jackpot!
![[Gwennen - GwennenBombPlacedTreasure7.ogg]]

#### GwennenAllBombsPlacedRandom
Ready!
![[Gwennen - GwennenAllBombsPlacedRandom.ogg]]

#### GwennenAllBombsPlaced2
Ready.
![[Gwennen - GwennenAllBombsPlaced2.ogg]]

#### GwennenAllBombsPlaced4
Give the order!
![[Gwennen - GwennenAllBombsPlaced4.ogg]]

#### GwennenAllBombsPlaced7
Bracing!
![[Gwennen - GwennenAllBombsPlaced7.ogg]]

#### GwennenCombatLineRandom
Luck aid me!
![[Gwennen - GwennenCombatLineRandom.ogg]]

#### GwennenEncounterCompleteRandom
Ha!
![[Gwennen - GwennenEncounterCompleteRandom.ogg]]

#### GwennenEncounterComplete4
Not today!
![[Gwennen - GwennenEncounterComplete4.ogg]]

#### GwennenEncounterComplete7
For the Kalguur!
![[Gwennen - GwennenEncounterComplete7.ogg]]

#### GwennenEncounterComplete10
Not a chance!
![[Gwennen - GwennenEncounterComplete10.ogg]]

#### Tujen
We've campaigned together for many years. It's taken a great toll on him, but he soldiers on. I don't know how he remains so cheery, honestly. If he loses another limb, he'll be more metal than man...
![[Gwennen - Tujen.ogg]]

#### Rog
He's a sweetheart. Have you seen the figurines he carves? The four of us use them to play this delightfully strange game he came up with. I love it because there are so many dice rolls, and, well, you know me.
![[Gwennen - Rog.ogg]]

#### Dannig
Our intrepid leader believes in a world better than the one that truly is. He doesn't see you and me, Exile. He sees heroes. He sees grandiose myths and world-changing bravery. Don't dispel those notions. I want to live in the world he sees, even if I know it isn't real.
![[Gwennen - Dannig.ogg]]

#### Luck
During the failed rebellion, I once called out with all my heart. An arrow was arcing through the air. My arm was pinned, and I knew I couldn't get out of the way in time. I was a dead woman. But Luck answered my earnest request. Another arrow, also on a murderous path, hit the first {in midair}, and both were diverted, landing on either side of me instead! That was the first time I knew that Chance itself was a real force in this world.
![[Gwennen - Luck.ogg]]

#### Failed Rebellion
I didn't say that. You must have misheard.
![[Gwennen - Failed Rebellion.ogg]]

#### Luck_2
During... an unspecified war... I once called out with all my heart. An arrow was arcing through the air. My arm was pinned, and I knew I couldn't get out of the way in time. I was a dead woman. But Luck answered my earnest request. Another arrow, also on a murderous path, hit the first {in midair}, and both were diverted, landing on either side of me instead! That was the first time I knew that Chance itself was a real force in this world.
![[Gwennen - Luck_2.ogg]]

#### The King
You're pushing your luck with questions like that, Exile. Don't waste it. You'll need every scrap of fortune you can get when the time comes.
![[Gwennen - The King.ogg]]

#### Gods
Never heard of 'gods,' but I know I wouldn't put my faith in them even if they came to my doorstep with an army. I've already solidified my beliefs where they belong.
![[Gwennen - Gods.ogg]]

#### Druids of the Broken Circle
I am honour-bound to discover the fate of Medved and the Druids of the Broken Circle. They believed they could see into the future by peering into the past. Hypothetically, that's a power I'd very much like to have, for reasons of chance and profit... but I'm not sure I want it to be true. If Medved and his nature-mystics were right and Time truly is a circle, aren't we all doomed to repeat our lives over and over for eternity? If that is the truth, then there is no luck. No chance, no human will. All life is just a stageplay repeating over and over. I don't think I like that notion.
![[Gwennen - Druids of the Broken Circle.ogg]]

#### Medved
His final fate was unknown, but I do know he cast off his peaceful ways and trained with two powerful axes after he arrived here. We're not fools. We see that the dead rise here on Wraeclast. If Medved is still out there, he'll be extremely dangerous. Conserve your luck, and use it against him if you find him.
![[Gwennen - Medved.ogg]]

#### Medved_2
So the Druids lost the ability to see into the past after Olroth began using Wraeclast's forbidden gems... how strange... and Medved headed off into the dark of night to challenge the leader of the creatures to a one-on-one battle, no doubt. Honourable, but foolish. There's more to this story, Exile. I hope you can find it.
![[Gwennen - Medved_2.ogg]]

#### Medved's Defeat
You have put Medved to rest after all this time. Thank you. I am descended from Annest, the daughter that he sent away before the end, so I could never leave here without ensuring my ancestor's peace. That is one more step toward freedom.
![[Gwennen - Medved's Defeat.ogg]]

#### Medved's Defeat_2
The tale is now complete. Medved was a noble and well-intentioned hero, but the darkness of Wraeclast corrupted him and turned him toward madness. Now that he has been put to rest, I am free. Once we find the Triskelion Flame, I can return home. I must thank you for this. I am descended from Annest, the daughter that Medved sent away before the end, so his actions mark the honour of my lineage. When we return home, I will end the tale at his journey into the night to challenge evil's unseen leader. The Kalguur will know that he died in combat trying to save his people. The rest does not need to be told.
![[Gwennen - Medved's Defeat_2.ogg]]

#### GwennenSettlersIdleConvo_Random
What could he possibly want with Wraeclast?
![[Gwennen - GwennenSettlersIdleConvo_Random.ogg]]

#### GwennenSettlersIdleConvo_4
Whatever he's after, we have to stop him...
![[Gwennen - GwennenSettlersIdleConvo_4.ogg]]

#### GwennenSettlersConvoWithIslaOne
All your inventions need, Isla, is a little luck.
![[Gwennen - GwennenSettlersConvoWithIslaOne.ogg]]

#### GwennenSettlersConvoWithIslaTwo
The greatest outcomes stem from the smallest moments.
![[Gwennen - GwennenSettlersConvoWithIslaTwo.ogg]]

#### Kingsmarch
I'm all for the {idea} of Kingsmarch. I just don't like... the name. For now, I'll support it from afar.
![[Gwennen - Kingsmarch.ogg]]

#### Kingsmarch_2
You've built quite the town. I've visited, now and again. I try to keep out of the public eye.
![[Gwennen - Kingsmarch_2.ogg]]

#### Johan
Johan's here?! On Wraeclast?! Then the game is afoot once more...
![[Gwennen - Johan.ogg]]

#### Middengard
It's a beautiful continent. A harsh, beautiful continent. Mountainous... well, volcanic. The most verdant valleys and sparkling waterfalls you'll ever see. It's the people... the people are amazing, for the most part. Heroes. Scholars. Determined. Not in the grand sense you might hear in songs. Real people, doing their best. We tried. We really did...
![[Gwennen - Middengard.ogg]]

#### 'Another' Rebellion
Johan mentioned he's keeping an eye out for 'another' rebellion, did he? It's a sign of our sheer distance from home, that he would dare mention one happened in the first place. The bards do not dare sing of the good folk that gave everything... gave their {lives...} I'm sorry, I shouldn't drag you into this. It's dangerous for you to even know about it.
![[Gwennen - 'Another' Rebellion.ogg]]

#### Introduction_4
Oh, don't mind me, just... visiting Rog. You wouldn't mind keeping this between you and me, would you? I'd rather not have Johan know I was here.
![[Gwennen - Introduction_4.ogg]]

#### Dear Rog
Of course I'll make it to game night. I'm not avoiding Kingsmarch per se, it's just better for everybody if Johan doesn't see me. He might recognise me. The rest of you escaped when it all fell apart, but he saw my face. I gave him that scar. He's the one man in this world that would know me if he saw me and then he could certainly guess who my surviving allies were. The King's paranoid suspicions have been bad enough, but a confirmation would bring doom down on us.
![[Gwennen - Dear Rog.ogg]]
