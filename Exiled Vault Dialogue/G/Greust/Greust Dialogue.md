## Greust Dialogue
#### Introduction
I am Greust. I hunt boar, hunt to feed my people. If you are not a friend to us... you need to run faster than boar.
![[Greust - Introduction.ogg]]

#### Eramir
We are Azmeri. You are not. Eramir is not. Life was good when it was just Azmeri.
![[Greust - Eramir.ogg]]

#### Yeena
Yeena thinks she knows the Spirit. That it talks to her. She talks to herself.
![[Greust - Yeena.ogg]]

#### Silk
Silk is no hunter. Silk scares children with stories at fire time. That Eight-Leg he wears... he did not kill it. Found it in the forest, dead of age. I would like to see Silk face live Eight-Leg one day. See him wrapped up for lunch.

#### Blood Apes
They fall from trees, try to swarm over you like fleas. Their chieftain... stand back when he beats his chest. Bark is worse than bite.
![[Greust - Blood Apes.ogg]]

#### Vipers
Their skin makes good boots. Their spit makes painful death.
![[Greust - Vipers.ogg]]

#### Elementals
Rocks and water, they move and live like monkey and viper. They die like monkey and viper too. There is no heart to see, but there is a heart to stab, if you can find it with your spear.
![[Greust - Elementals.ogg]]

#### Maligaro's Spike
Silk has the mind of a blood monkey! That 'spear' stinks of sickness. And you are a monkey too if you believe his story. Stuck in Mother Eight-Leg? More like he dropped it when he ran away from Baby Eight-Leg.

#### Blackguards
I have seen warriors in black in the East. They are from your Oriath. Better fed, better armed than you, exile. Oriath did not want you, so why does it follow you here? You will understand what you see more than I. Go east and find these warriors in black. If there is danger to us, I need to learn of it.
![[Greust - Blackguards.ogg]]

#### Helena
The Oriathan girl... she is alive. She wants to stay with us, not to go back to her people. I say we take her traitor's heart to their chief. Ask that the warriors in black leave us be. I sleep less, but know more... thanks to you. Helena gave me this. Use it, or cast it away. I do not care. I have no time for Helena's breed of peace.
![[Greust - Helena.ogg]]

#### Helena_2
I have no use for Helena's kind of peace.
![[Greust - Helena_2.ogg]]

#### Chamber of Sins
Unclean. Do not eat of the trees surrounding the Chamber of Sins, do not drink of the water, and do not rest. The beasts there look weak, born badly. They are faster, stronger than they seem.
![[Greust - Chamber of Sins.ogg]]

#### Bandit Lords
This is our home. We hunt, we grow, we build. Your kind in the forest... kill, steal, and burn. Soon they will take it all, leave us no food. Then we must move. Leave our home.
![[Greust - Bandit Lords.ogg]]

#### Bandit Lords_2
You are a hunter of man. Today you have hunted bandits. Tomorrow, when you are restless, will you hunt us? You should go, find another hunting ground. Leave us in peace.
![[Greust - Bandit Lords_2.ogg]]

#### The Darkness
Nothing like this happens until you are here. Bring back the light, or you will find my spear in your throat.
![[Greust - The Darkness.ogg]]

#### The Light
You have made peace with our land. For now, my spear is lowered.
![[Greust - The Light.ogg]]
