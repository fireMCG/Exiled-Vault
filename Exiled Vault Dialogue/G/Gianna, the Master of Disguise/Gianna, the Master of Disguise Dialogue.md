![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - SelectionBanterGiannaToKurai.ogg]]

Shame... Tullina, would you mind running lines with me later?

You've got quite the stature, Adiyah. Have you ever considered acting?
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - ExitBanterGiannaToAdiyah.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterGiannaToAdiyahTwo
Would you?
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - ExitBanterGiannaToAdiyahTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterGiannaToAdiyahThree
Oh... okay then...
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - ExitBanterGiannaToAdiyahThree.ogg]]

Thanks for keeping us all safe, big guy.

Tibbie! Always love a job with you.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - SelectionBanterTibbsGiannaReply.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTibbsGiannaReplyTwo
Uhh, yeah, that was... a mistake.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - SelectionBanterTibbsGiannaReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTibbsGiannaReplyThree
Well, let's just say he looked a lot more than he listened.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - SelectionBanterTibbsGiannaReplyThree.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterTibbsGiannaReplyFour
Aha! Sailors...
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - SelectionBanterTibbsGiannaReplyFour.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterGiannaToTibbs
Fingers crossed this one goes better than our sewer scrape, eh, Tibbie?
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - SelectionBanterGiannaToTibbs.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterGiannaToTibbsTwo
Did you ever find out where those busts were?
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - SelectionBanterGiannaToTibbsTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterGiannaToTibbsThree
That was a lot of platinum!
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - SelectionBanterGiannaToTibbsThree.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterGiannaToTibbsFour
Could've bought an island with that platinum.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - SelectionBanterGiannaToTibbsFour.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterGiannaToKuraiTwo
Nothing Ku.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - SelectionBanterGiannaToKuraiTwo.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterKarstGiannaReply
Improvisation! Lovely.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - EntryBanterKarstGiannaReply.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterGiannaToKarst
Stick to the script everyone.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - EntryBanterGiannaToKarst.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterKarstGiannaReply
Count me in!
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - ExitBanterKarstGiannaReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterGiannaToKarst
Take a bow, everyone!
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - ExitBanterGiannaToKarst.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterKarstGiannaReply
Keep it in your tights, Karst.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - SelectionBanterKarstGiannaReply.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterKarstGiannaReplyTwo
That depends... Are you expecting something in return?
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - SelectionBanterKarstGiannaReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterKarstGiannaReplyThree
I don't think Nenet is all that interested.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - SelectionBanterKarstGiannaReplyThree.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterKarstGiannaReplyFour
Oh Karst, you're such a good thief! You can take anything... but a hint.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - SelectionBanterKarstGiannaReplyFour.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterKarstGiannaReplyFive
I'm... not sure you used that word ri--
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - SelectionBanterKarstGiannaReplyFive.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterKarstGiannaReplySix
Oh! Were the roses from you?
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - SelectionBanterKarstGiannaReplySix.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterKarstGiannaReplySeven
The toffees?
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - SelectionBanterKarstGiannaReplySeven.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterKarstGiannaReplyEight
Aww, did you get me that beautiful gown!?
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - SelectionBanterKarstGiannaReplyEight.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterKarstGiannaReplyNine
Sorry?
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - SelectionBanterKarstGiannaReplyNine.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterKarstGiannaReplyTen
...Oh. Yes. ...Thank you.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - SelectionBanterKarstGiannaReplyTen.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterGiannaToIsla
I'm here. Isla, will we be seeing some new inventions for this job?
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - SelectionBanterGiannaToIsla.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterGiannaToIslaTwo
But you've tested them at least, right? ...Right? ...Isla?
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - SelectionBanterGiannaToIslaTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterIslaGiannaReply
The ones that make people sick?
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - SelectionBanterIslaGiannaReply.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterIslaGiannaReplyTwo
What's the difference?
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - SelectionBanterIslaGiannaReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### SelectionBanterIslaGiannaReplyThree
Just what every man likes to see.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - SelectionBanterIslaGiannaReplyThree.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterGiannaToIsla
You know what we could really use...?
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - EntryBanterGiannaToIsla.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterGiannaToIslaTwo
Yes!
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - EntryBanterGiannaToIslaTwo.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterGiannaToIslaThree
Or just a normal mirror! For makeup!
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - EntryBanterGiannaToIslaThree.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterIslaGiannaReply
Ah, but a watched rose never blossoms, my dear.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - EntryBanterIslaGiannaReply.ogg]]

#### EntryBanterIslaGiannaReplyTwo
Thank you. But seriously, if you stare at me, we WILL be caught.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - EntryBanterIslaGiannaReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterGiannaToIsla
I have to admit, engineer, you make quite the spectacle yourself sometimes!
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - ExitBanterGiannaToIsla.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterGiannaToIslaTwo
I have so much to learn about science...
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - ExitBanterGiannaToIslaTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterIslaGiannaReply
You know what? You might.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - ExitBanterIslaGiannaReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterIslaGiannaReplyTwo
Normally I'd disapprove, but it's Niles, so...
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - ExitBanterIslaGiannaReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### Introduction
Hey good lookin'. Huh. Most people recognise me. I'm Gianna. Worked a spell in the Chitus Theatre, back when you could leave your house without being followed by Templar secret police. I was Shavronne in {An Axiom Tragedy}. I played Dialla, the Gemling Queen, in {Purity Tales}, and the fair lady Merveil in {Daresso and Merveil}, for which I was very nearly nominated to receive a 'Tario. No? Not a fan of the theatre, I suppose? That's-... That's fine. That act of my story has drawn to a close anyway, but I'm always looking for the next great role. Nothing's quite so thrilling as immersing oneself among the people, and seeing if you can, in fact, pass for the real deal.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - Introduction.ogg]]

#### The Boss
I wasn't exactly planning on a life of crime. Yes, most in my profession do end up begging or stealing, but my career was on the up and up, until I was accused of {Pecuniary Lust} and exiled. It just so happens that the Boss, cultural elite that he is, saw me in a few shows. He must have noticed my ability to fully embody any role, to become not just the character, but the person. I'm told he was a practitioner of the performing arts himself, in his youth. Obviously, he has a keen eye for talent. I'm dying to perform a dialogue with him. Good material is hard to come by 'round here, but I did find a piece by a Bestel floating in the foam. Not particularly engaging, and a frankly unhealthy focus on the female lead's figure in the stage direction, but it's something, at least. Alas, Kurai maintains the Boss' schedule, and I'm told he is booked up indefinitely. Imagine having lucrative work for months to come! A performer can only dream...
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - The Boss.ogg]]

#### The Nameless Play
Just my luck! Of course you are put on my contract. Do you even know anything about the theatre? The cursed play? The one no performer should ever name, lest they end up consumed by the phantom that haunts it? It's said that the play's author wrote it while high as an eagle on ergot. He didn't know, of course, and died upon penning the final word. The play, whose name I shall not utter, is about a beautiful young lady who finds herself swept into a world beneath the sands of the Vastiri, where the dead have built a city of bones. She marries a statue, becomes the queen of this city, and then her skin peels off and a hundred little versions of her spill out. Completely nutty. It's locked up with the rest of the works deemed distasteful by the Templar, and I simply must have it.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - The Nameless Play.ogg]]

#### The Nameless Play_2
{Marilla turns to her beloved's unmoving face and speaks the blessed words: Marilla: Two into one, one into many, to churn the world beneath the crashing dunes. Marilla's body shatters like porcelain, each fragment becoming Marilla. Each new Marilla shatters again, and again, each fragment becomes whole. The stage is flooded by Marilla. All is Marilla. The statue rises and exits stage right. Fin.} Wow. I mean... wow. That was something! Right? That... that was something, right? I think I might just stick to the unbanned works for a little while, actually. Thanks, though.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - The Nameless Play_2.ogg]]

#### The Finest Costumes
You're handling my contract again? I thought I specifically requested someone with a working understanding of the arts! Fine, fine. It's just a job. Well, I'm sure you've done the necessary reading, but I'm dying to gab a bit. When I worked with the Theopolis Thespian Society, there was an old, old, {old} woman. I mean, at {least} forty. She was our seamstress. She created these costumes that looked just like the real thing. Blackguard uniforms, Templar outfits, you name it. Well, one day she vanished, but the costumes remained. I want to get ahold of that old woman's costumes. They were just so... believable! With those, it'll be much easier to slip into a role undetected.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - The Finest Costumes.ogg]]

#### The Finest Costumes_2
I don't know how she did it. Each outfit so perfectly matches the original piece. It's almost as if-...what!? {Property of Templar Logistics Office}!? They're the genuine article! That woman stole real bloody uniforms! Well, I guess that explains why they always looked so genuine. It also explains why we didn't ever see her again. Oh well, her loss is our gain!

Gianna.

#### IntroductionVinderiGiannaReplyTwo
Performer. Actress.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - IntroductionVinderiGiannaReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### IntroductionVinderiGiannaReplyThree
We met when Vinderi was hired to do the pyrotechnics for a production. He set the curtains on fire, but no one died. I'm here to help you with this job. And other jobs, later. If you want.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - IntroductionVinderiGiannaReplyThree.ogg]]

#### IntroductionVinderiGiannaReplyFour
I think that covers it. Thanks, Vin.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - IntroductionVinderiGiannaReplyFour.ogg]]

#### GiannaPerceptionOne
I know set dressing when I see it.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaPerceptionOne.ogg]]

#### GiannaPerceptionTwo
They're hiding something. Look.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaPerceptionTwo.ogg]]

#### GiannaPerceptionThree
Those are props. Something's amiss.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaPerceptionThree.ogg]]

#### GiannaPerceptionFour
Something about this doesn't ring true... Hmm.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaPerceptionFour.ogg]]

#### GiannaPerceptionFive
It'd be easier to see with proper stage lighting...
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaPerceptionFive.ogg]]

#### GiannaPerceptionSix
All that time squinting at cue cards has trained me for this.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaPerceptionSix.ogg]]

#### GiannaDeceptionOne
Back in line, soldier! I will inspect!
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaDeceptionOne.ogg]]

#### GiannaDeceptionTwo
Did I say you could speak? Let me do this.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaDeceptionTwo.ogg]]

#### GiannaDeceptionThree
Quiet. ... See? Nothing. I'll show you.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaDeceptionThree.ogg]]

#### GiannaDeceptionFour
Are you drunk, soldier?! There's nothing on the other side.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaDeceptionFour.ogg]]

#### GiannaDeceptionFive
Stay in formation! This is a drill!
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaDeceptionFive.ogg]]

#### GiannaDeceptionSix
Obey your orders! I'll take point!
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaDeceptionSix.ogg]]

#### GiannaSmugglerOne
I didn't hear nothin', but let's see.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaSmugglerOne.ogg]]

#### GiannaSmugglerTwo
Oi, keep it down. Gettin' each other spooked. Here, I'll prove it.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaSmugglerTwo.ogg]]

#### GiannaSmugglerThree
Don't be so paranoid. Look, nothing's here...
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaSmugglerThree.ogg]]

#### GiannaSmugglerFour
You're just drunk, mate. Watch, it'll be empty.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaSmugglerFour.ogg]]

#### GiannaSmugglerFive
Probably just the rats. Afraid of rats? Let's find out!
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaSmugglerFive.ogg]]

#### GiannaSmugglerSix
Nah, you're just losin' it. How could anything be here?
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaSmugglerSix.ogg]]

#### GiannaCultistOne
Ease off the elixir. Nothing is here. Observe.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaCultistOne.ogg]]

#### GiannaCultistTwo
The fumes are affecting your judgement. I shall prove it.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaCultistTwo.ogg]]

#### GiannaCultistThree
Likely a mere apparition, but I'll make sure.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaCultistThree.ogg]]

#### GiannaCultistFour
Perhaps you should rest. I'll check for you.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaCultistFour.ogg]]

#### GiannaCultistFive
A hallucinatory phenomena. Anything you see is, as well.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaCultistFive.ogg]]

#### GiannaCultistSix
Hearing things is a known side effect, but just to be sure...
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaCultistSix.ogg]]

#### EngineeringGiannaOne
Just like the stagehands taught me.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - EngineeringGiannaOne.ogg]]

#### EngineeringGiannaTwo
Let's hope this thing holds.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - EngineeringGiannaTwo.ogg]]

#### EngineeringGiannaThree
Should be sturdy... enough.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - EngineeringGiannaThree.ogg]]

#### EngineeringGiannaFour
Not the sort of catwalk I thought I'd be walking...
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - EngineeringGiannaFour.ogg]]

#### EngineeringGiannaFive
We used one of these backstage, 'til it took a lad's head off.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - EngineeringGiannaFive.ogg]]

#### EngineeringGiannaSix
Drumroll please... But quietly.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - EngineeringGiannaSix.ogg]]

#### GiannaBusyOne
My focus is elsewhere.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaBusyOne.ogg]]

#### GiannaBusyTwo
I need to finish this first.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaBusyTwo.ogg]]

#### GiannaBusyThree
You can't rush a good performance.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaBusyThree.ogg]]

#### GiannaBusyFour
Good work takes time.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaBusyFour.ogg]]

#### GiannaBusyFive
Please try to be patient.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaBusyFive.ogg]]

#### GiannaInterruptedOne
Protect your female lead.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaInterruptedOne.ogg]]

#### GiannaInterruptedTwo
Hey, you're hindering a great performance.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaInterruptedTwo.ogg]]

#### GiannaInterruptedThree
So distracting and awful.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaInterruptedThree.ogg]]

#### GiannaInterruptedFour
Mean. Mean mean mean.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaInterruptedFour.ogg]]

#### GiannaCombatStartOne
We've got trouble.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaCombatStartOne.ogg]]

#### GiannaCombatStartTwo
We're just looking around, I swear!
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaCombatStartTwo.ogg]]

#### GiannaCombatStartThree
Exile? Need you for this!
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaCombatStartThree.ogg]]

#### GiannaCombatStartFour
Guards! Weapons up!
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaCombatStartFour.ogg]]

#### GiannaCombatStartFive
Enemies heading our way!
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaCombatStartFive.ogg]]

#### GiannaCombatEndOne
What an anticlimax.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaCombatEndOne.ogg]]

#### GiannaCombatEndTwo
Should've rehearsed more.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaCombatEndTwo.ogg]]

#### GiannaCombatEndThree
Saw that ending coming a mile away.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaCombatEndThree.ogg]]

#### GiannaCombatEndFour
What, no plot twist?
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaCombatEndFour.ogg]]

#### GiannaCombatEndFive
Always knew I'd knock 'em dead.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaCombatEndFive.ogg]]

#### GiannaLootOne
Oooh, that's soooo pretty.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaLootOne.ogg]]

#### GiannaLootTwo
That gives me an idea for a character.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaLootTwo.ogg]]

#### GiannaLootThree
Really good find.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaLootThree.ogg]]

#### GiannaLootFour
Finders keepers, eh?
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaLootFour.ogg]]

#### GiannaLootFive
You've a keen eye for pretty little things, don't you?
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaLootFive.ogg]]

#### GiannaAlertOne
Shh. We don't want an audience.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaAlertOne.ogg]]

#### GiannaAlertTwo
Keep it down. There's a lot left to do.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaAlertTwo.ogg]]

#### GiannaAlertThree
Quiet, or we'll have to end early.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaAlertThree.ogg]]

#### GiannaAlertFour
This is far more tense than I like.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaAlertFour.ogg]]

#### GiannaAlarmOne
That's our cue to leave!
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaAlarmOne.ogg]]

#### GiannaAlarmTwo
Head for the exit!
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaAlarmTwo.ogg]]

#### GiannaAlarmThree
Make a run for it!
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaAlarmThree.ogg]]

#### GiannaSurpriseAlarmOne
Well, now we improvise!
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaSurpriseAlarmOne.ogg]]

#### GiannaSurpriseAlarmTwo
So much for the plan! Run!
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaSurpriseAlarmTwo.ogg]]

#### GiannaSurpriseAlarmThree
That's not good! We need to rush!
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaSurpriseAlarmThree.ogg]]

#### GiannaFinalRoomOne
And there, before her, was everything she wanted...
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaFinalRoomOne.ogg]]

#### GiannaFinalRoomTwo
They were so close, they could almost taste it.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaFinalRoomTwo.ogg]]

#### GiannaFinalRoomThree
In most plays, this is where I'd double-cross you. ... I-... I'm not going to double-cross you.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaFinalRoomThree.ogg]]

#### GiannaFinalRoomFour
This is what we're here for. Go on.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaFinalRoomFour.ogg]]

#### GiannaFinalRoomFive
Well? Don't keep the audience waiting!
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaFinalRoomFive.ogg]]

#### GiannaObjectiveOne
This is the part where you would double-cross me. Please don't.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaObjectiveOne.ogg]]

#### GiannaObjectiveTwo
Now all that's left is to head for the exit.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaObjectiveTwo.ogg]]

#### GiannaObjectiveThree
That's a relief. I always expect a trap for some reason.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaObjectiveThree.ogg]]

#### GiannaObjectiveFour
People have strange taste, don't you think?
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaObjectiveFour.ogg]]

#### GiannaEntryBanterOne
Ladies and gentlemen, the show's about to begin.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaEntryBanterOne.ogg]]

#### GiannaEntryBanterTwo
Stay on script and hit your marks.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaEntryBanterTwo.ogg]]

#### GiannaEntryBanterThree
Take a deep breath before we head in. Might be your last.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaEntryBanterThree.ogg]]

#### GiannaEntryBanterFour
Focus. Watch your breath and move with caution.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaEntryBanterFour.ogg]]

#### GiannaEntryBanterFive
Take your time. This is just the warmup act.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaEntryBanterFive.ogg]]

#### GiannaExitBanterOne
Aaaaand scene!
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaExitBanterOne.ogg]]

#### GiannaExitBanterTwo
Take a BOW! That was phenomenal!
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaExitBanterTwo.ogg]]

#### GiannaExitBanterThree
How about a bloody round of applause, eh?
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaExitBanterThree.ogg]]

#### GiannaExitBanterFour
By Innocence, I do love a happy ending.
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaExitBanterFour.ogg]]

#### GiannaExitBanterFive
Faultless! Stunning! An incredible performance! And you were also very good!
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaExitBanterFive.ogg]]

#### GiannaPerceptionLoudOne
Wait, what's that!?
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaPerceptionLoudOne.ogg]]

#### GiannaPerceptionLoudTwo
Look! There! No, there!
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaPerceptionLoudTwo.ogg]]

#### GiannaPerceptionLoudThree
They've tried to hide something!
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaPerceptionLoudThree.ogg]]

#### GiannaPerceptionLoudFour
I know there's something wrong here, just need a bit of time!
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaPerceptionLoudFour.ogg]]

#### GiannaPerceptionLoudFive
A lot of work went into hiding something here!
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaPerceptionLoudFive.ogg]]

#### GiannaPerceptionLoudSix
Some convincing fakes here! What are they hiding!?
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaPerceptionLoudSix.ogg]]

#### GiannaDeceptionLoudOne
Open it! Let them through! Oh, I'll do it!
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaDeceptionLoudOne.ogg]]

#### GiannaDeceptionLoudTwo
Stand back! I'll take them on single handedly!
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaDeceptionLoudTwo.ogg]]

#### GiannaDeceptionLoudThree
Make way! I must let the reinforcements in!
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaDeceptionLoudThree.ogg]]

#### GiannaDeceptionLoudFour
Give passage! I have a plan!
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaDeceptionLoudFour.ogg]]

#### GiannaDeceptionLoudFive
They're with us!
![[Gianna, the Master of Disguise - GiannaDeceptionLoudFive.ogg]]

#### GiannaDeceptionLoudSix
