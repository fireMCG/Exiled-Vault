## Eagon Dialogue
#### Introduction
You're one of them, aren't you? An Exile? What strange odds to meet you here and now. I am Eagon, and I am undertaking an immensely important mission - and perhaps you can be of some use. See this tear? It is a gateway of sorts... to different realities within the Atlas. You may be wondering how I know all this... Of course, a commonborn such as yourself wouldn't understand! The Originator of these realities left breadcrumbs. A trail. A thread of physical manifestations of the person's memories. They seem to be experimenting with the Atlas in a profound way. Entangling themself within the very fabric of what the Atlas is made of... and there, I believe they are trapped. With my brain and your brawn, perhaps we can find answers to these questions. I'm sure there'll be something in it for you, to make it worth your while. What do you say?
![[Eagon - Introduction.ogg]]

#### Zana's Memories
This tear – and others like them – give us a glimpse into what this other plane of reality is composed of. Their compositions took me quite some time to deconstruct, but working backward from its final structure, I was able to reinterpret them using the superposition of the memories' resonances and offsetting that entanglement from the Atlas itself... Hmm... have I lost you? It is merely the nature of reality we are discussing here! Put plainly, in finding these tears, we can access the memories within them. There, we can chase down the one creating them. The Originator. Unfortunately, the Atlas seems to have some unstable effects on the... {presentation} of these memories... but I hope that we can reach the Originator and save... her – well, more on that later.
![[Eagon - Zana's Memories.ogg]]

#### EagonWildApproachTear
Go on, Exile - approach the tear.
![[Eagon - EagonWildApproachTear.ogg]]

#### EagonAnnoyedApproachGossip
What are you doing? Approach the tear!
![[Eagon - EagonAnnoyedApproachGossip.ogg]]

#### EagonOnFinalZanaPortalOpen
We have done it! We have her location! There seems to be a safe haven within her web of threads. How remarkable! Finally... I have a chance to properly talk with Zana and get the answers I deserve. Let us make our way there at once.
![[Eagon - EagonOnFinalZanaPortalOpen.ogg]]

#### EagonUnlockFirstTearWild
It is done.
![[Eagon - EagonUnlockFirstTearWild.ogg]]

#### Thread Coordinates
I have the thread coordinates. You will need to visit each location along the thread, to gain access to the subsequent ones. You have access to a map device, yes? Good. Let us meet there and I shall reveal the location of the first memory.
![[Eagon - Thread Coordinates.ogg]]

#### EagonWildDoNotDally
Do not dally!
![[Eagon - EagonWildDoNotDally.ogg]]

#### Kirac
Quite the establishment you've got here! Kirac looks much older in person... I must say, I don't really care for his demeanour. Rather grumpy and sour. Rather... dull. In any case, shall we utilise these coordinates?
![[Eagon - Kirac.ogg]]

#### Zana
She... knew me? But how? I am... bewildered to say the least. We must not stop. It is not clear whether she is fully aware of what is happening. She may be confused. We must explore more threads and find her once again.
![[Eagon - Zana.ogg]]

#### Zana_2
I cannot begin to fathom what she was talking about. It is... deeply troubling. This is the closest I've ever been to my family, and yet... I feel immensely distant. We must press on. I must have answers. We must find another tear!
![[Eagon - Zana_2.ogg]]

#### Saving Zana
She said... she is not my sister? Then... who am I? None of this makes any sense. My life continues to be an unsolved mystery. But I must move forward. I must... aspire. We should continue our work. There must be a way to appeal to Zana to prevent her unravelling herself beyond redemption. If we continue to disrupt these memories, perhaps we can prevent her from destroying herself. Atlas be damned! We must save Zana!
![[Eagon - Saving Zana.ogg]]

#### My Sister
My sweet sister... Though I've not been able to communicate with her, I've read everything I could get my hands on that she has written... I feel a connection to her. I do feel some semblance of jealousy that she had time with our father, yes. I also feel guilty that I wasn't there for her when she needed me. That is something I hope to make right. And perhaps, if I am lucky, Zana may have answers to some of my most burning questions...
![[Eagon - My Sister.ogg]]

#### My Father
It was not a... traditional upbringing. I wanted for nothing... except knowing who I truly was. The family I was placed with treated me less like a child and more like a patron. Disgusting, really. Sometimes I'd wish to learn a lesson the hard way. Sometimes I'd wish to be told no... or even to receive a light beating. But these are inconsequential complaints. Had I known I was the bastard son of the {magnificent} Valdo Caeserius, perhaps I would have felt differently. Everyone has some sort of confusing path to navigate and this was mine. Here and now... I just wish to know why. Why did he cast me out? Why didn't he wish to know his only son? Perhaps these questions will haunt me all my mortal life.
![[Eagon - My Father.ogg]]

#### The Realisation
It took me years to fully unravel that I was a Caeserius. You may look at me and think, auburn hair, gifted, eloquent and well-dressed... How obvious! But the person you see before you and the one that grew up with a silver spoon in his mouth are quite different people. Funnily enough, it was a maid that planted the seed in my mind. She would hum a tune as she changed the bed dressings in my room. One day, I asked her what it was she was humming. Without thinking, she laughed and said it was {'one of Valdo's favourites'}. There was no question in my mind who she was referring to. But why would this woman know such a man's favourite melodies? And why is she {now} taking care of me? I probed further and she soon began to resemble a ripe tomato and bolted out the door. I pressed the family on this. I never saw the maid again and I was shunned from asking such questions. The relationship grew ever more sour after that. I knew this was a significant matter... but I didn't know the extent to which so many people had gone to keep me from knowing the truth.
![[Eagon - The Realisation.ogg]]

#### Exceeding Potential
Yes, yes. It would of course mean a lot to know {why}... but I have scant reason to think of it now. The trajectory of my life changed the moment I knew, albeit vaguely, who I was. The son of a notably brilliant mind! Bastard or not, I would live up to that truth. I would exceed my potential. Blast it, I would exceed his potential too! I became obsessed with his work. Who he was as a father mattered less to me - I expected I'd never know him that way. But I was determined to make the most of the brain I'd inherited. In some ways, in spite of him. In other ways, because of him.
![[Eagon - Exceeding Potential.ogg]]

#### Pushing our Limits
Well... without the support of Templar backing and father's innumerable donors, I am actually a self-made explorer of the Atlas. I would say I've done quite well for myself, wouldn't you? What I lack in sheer strength, I make up for with Caeserius wit and arrogance. If not for that, I don't think I'd have made it this far. Sometimes we all must push ourselves beyond our limits, to get what we truly want... and what we truly deserve.
![[Eagon - Pushing our Limits.ogg]]

#### Memory Tears
Once I had learned about my family's fate, I was determined to follow in their footsteps. To traverse realities. To navigate the Atlas. I suppose initially I was driven by a desire to find them. But soon I was driven by a desire to better myself. To grow my capabilities. Thankfully, I am more self-aware than my father. I saw the folly in his ways. Once I discovered the tears, once I glimpsed Zana within them... my attention was refocused. Everything is now about saving her.
![[Eagon - Memory Tears.ogg]]

#### Destroying the Atlas
I struggle to understand her. How can she believe this is the only way? What does it even mean... to destroy the Atlas? The Atlas is but another interpretation of the reality we see. How can one exist without the other? I feel inept. She {must} know something I do not. For that reason, I am fearful. Let me be on this topic. I must consider it further...
![[Eagon - Destroying the Atlas.ogg]]

#### Destroying the Atlas_2
You really must push on with this, yes? I believe I asked politely to not be questioned further on it! Look, I do not know what it means. But yes... Zana is indeed affecting the Atlas in a significant way. Somehow, her memories are spilling over into the rest of the Atlas. I... I don't know how. I must think on it!
![[Eagon - Destroying the Atlas_2.ogg]]

#### Destroying the Atlas_3
How can I know the way forward if I don't know how or why these things are happening, you simpleton! Idiot!
![[Eagon - Destroying the Atlas_3.ogg]]

#### Destroying the Atlas_4
I'm... sorry. This is all quite stressful. I'm sure there is a logical explanation. Once I know what it is, you'll be the first to hear about it.
![[Eagon - Destroying the Atlas_4.ogg]]

#### The Maven
Ugh, Eldritch entities... I'd rather not start thinking about all that for the moment, if you don't mind. I've had a hard enough time contemplating what is happening with my family, let alone all that nonsense!
![[Eagon - The Maven.ogg]]

#### Sirus, Awakener of Worlds
I know little of this foolish man. All I do know is that he once served Zana, but whoever that was is not who he has become. The Atlas has claimed many friends, and family...
![[Eagon - Sirus, Awakener of Worlds.ogg]]

#### The Envoy
Ah, yes... I have heard his ramblings in my travels within the Atlas. Not very scientific, to my ears. I find myself wondering if that being just enjoys hearing himself talk.
![[Eagon - The Envoy.ogg]]

#### Seeking Answers
It is... deeply troubling. For years, I believed her to be my sister. If she is not my sister, then Valdo is not my father. Yet... she said I mean 'much' to her. I must have answers. I must... understand.
![[Eagon - Seeking Answers.ogg]]

#### EagonApproachFirstTime
You there! A moment of your time?
![[Eagon - EagonApproachFirstTime.ogg]]

#### EagonOpenGatewayFirstTime
Fantastic! What a magnificent device... Go on, then! See what you can find in there!
![[Eagon - EagonOpenGatewayFirstTime.ogg]]

#### EagonFinalMapStartOne
This is it! Here, we should be able to find the memory kernel of this thread... Go well, Exile!
![[Eagon - EagonFinalMapStartOne.ogg]]

#### EagonSeesChildZanaOne
Sweet sister. Tormented by your own creation... in this horrid prison of your mind... Do what you must, Exile. Save her from whatever horror the Atlas makes of her memory! But know this, you must be-
![[Eagon - EagonSeesChildZanaOne.ogg]]

#### EagonFinalMapEndOne
Well done! I knew you could do it! Now... I should be able to harness the origin of this form to... ugh... No matter, step aside.
![[Eagon - EagonFinalMapEndOne.ogg]]

#### EagonMemoryExtractedOne
There we have it! Now we have the true origin of this particular thread. With this, we can track down the Originator! Let us meet back at the device!
![[Eagon - EagonMemoryExtractedOne.ogg]]

#### EagonPinnacleOpenOne
Now... We must find her!
![[Eagon - EagonPinnacleOpenOne.ogg]]

#### EagonPinnacleZanaOne
This is different.
![[Eagon - EagonPinnacleZanaOne.ogg]]

#### EagonValdoAppearsOne
My word... It is him... Father...
![[Eagon - EagonValdoAppearsOne.ogg]]

#### EagonAfterFirstPinnacleOne
Zana! You don't know me. But I am your–
![[Eagon - EagonAfterFirstPinnacleOne.ogg]]

#### EagonAfterFirstPinnacleTwo
What... What just happened? Where did she go? Damn it!
![[Eagon - EagonAfterFirstPinnacleTwo.ogg]]

#### EagonApproachTear_Random
Here, Exile! Another tear!
![[Eagon - EagonApproachTear_Random.ogg]]

#### EagonApproachTear_5
Over here, don't dally!
![[Eagon - EagonApproachTear_5.ogg]]

#### EagonApproachTear_9
Exile, we have yet to unravel this one!
![[Eagon - EagonApproachTear_9.ogg]]

#### EagonApproachTear_13
Look, Exile - a fresh tear!
![[Eagon - EagonApproachTear_13.ogg]]

#### EagonFinalMapStartTwo
We've made it. Search for the memory kernel here and I will come to you!
![[Eagon - EagonFinalMapStartTwo.ogg]]

#### EagonFinalMapEndTwo
Please, allow me to extract the location...
![[Eagon - EagonFinalMapEndTwo.ogg]]

#### EagonMemoryExtractedTwo
I have it. Now back to the map device.
![[Eagon - EagonMemoryExtractedTwo.ogg]]

#### EagonPinnacleOpenTwo
Hopefully this time we will have {longer} to speak with her. Time to move.
![[Eagon - EagonPinnacleOpenTwo.ogg]]

#### EagonSeesChildZanaTwo
Another memory... An innocent moment between parent and child... distorted by the chaotic nature of the Atlas...
![[Eagon - EagonSeesChildZanaTwo.ogg]]

#### EagonAfterSecondPinnacleOne
Zana - wait! I must speak with you. I must understand!
![[Eagon - EagonAfterSecondPinnacleOne.ogg]]

#### EagonAfterSecondPinnacleTwo
But... why?
![[Eagon - EagonAfterSecondPinnacleTwo.ogg]]

#### EagonAfterSecondPinnacleThree
No. Come back! Just a little longer, please!
![[Eagon - EagonAfterSecondPinnacleThree.ogg]]

#### EagonFinalMapStartThree
Go, Exile. Locate the kernel and depose it.
![[Eagon - EagonFinalMapStartThree.ogg]]

#### EagonMemoryExtractedThree
That's it. We have what we need. Let us meet back at the device at once.
![[Eagon - EagonMemoryExtractedThree.ogg]]

#### EagonPinnacleOpenThree
Time to finally get answers. I am ready... {Are you}?
![[Eagon - EagonPinnacleOpenThree.ogg]]

#### EagonSeesChildZanaThree
Significant memories for a child... But a drop in a pool of insignificance to someone grown. Everything, a matter of perspective.
![[Eagon - EagonSeesChildZanaThree.ogg]]

#### EagonAfterThirdPinnacleOne
Now, I must know... What is the meaning of this?
![[Eagon - EagonAfterThirdPinnacleOne.ogg]]

#### EagonAfterThirdPinnacleTwo
The tear... It remains open! Let us speak to my sister.
![[Eagon - EagonAfterThirdPinnacleTwo.ogg]]

#### EagonAfterThirdPinnacleThree
Incredible! It allows us access. Let us speak to my sister!
![[Eagon - EagonAfterThirdPinnacleThree.ogg]]

#### EagonZanaConvoOne
It is true that I have pursued you, relentlessly so. But it is only to know your mind. To know your brilliance... and to save you.
![[Eagon - EagonZanaConvoOne.ogg]]

#### EagonZanaConvoTwo
Forgive me, but this cryptic {nonsense} only drives me further into despair of not knowing. Be plain with me. Tell me the truth.
![[Eagon - EagonZanaConvoTwo.ogg]]

#### EagonZanaConvoThree
To destroy what?
![[Eagon - EagonZanaConvoThree.ogg]]

#### EagonZanaConvoFour
But... {why}? Let us do this together. From the outside... Why must you suffer endlessly here to achieve this?
![[Eagon - EagonZanaConvoFour.ogg]]

#### EagonZanaConvoFive
Sister, please... Let me help you.
![[Eagon - EagonZanaConvoFive.ogg]]

#### EagonZanaConvoSix
What...? What do you mean?
![[Eagon - EagonZanaConvoSix.ogg]]

#### EagonZanaConvoSeven
No! Wait!
![[Eagon - EagonZanaConvoSeven.ogg]]

#### EagonUnlockTear_Random
Meet me back at the device.
![[Eagon - EagonUnlockTear_Random.ogg]]

#### EagonUnlockTear_5
I have the coordinates.
![[Eagon - EagonUnlockTear_5.ogg]]

#### EagonUnlockTear_9
Success. Return to the device when you are ready.
![[Eagon - EagonUnlockTear_9.ogg]]

#### EagonExtractMemory_Random
One moment, Exile!
![[Eagon - EagonExtractMemory_Random.ogg]]

#### EagonExtractMemory_5
I shall extract the location.
![[Eagon - EagonExtractMemory_5.ogg]]

#### EagonExtractMemory_7
Allow me!
![[Eagon - EagonExtractMemory_7.ogg]]

#### EagonExtractMemory_11
This shouldn't take a moment.
![[Eagon - EagonExtractMemory_11.ogg]]

#### EagonExtractMemory_15
Right, where was I...?
![[Eagon - EagonExtractMemory_15.ogg]]

#### EagonExtractMemory_20
Here we go, once more.
![[Eagon - EagonExtractMemory_20.ogg]]

#### EagonOpenGateway_Random
It is ready.
![[Eagon - EagonOpenGateway_Random.ogg]]

#### EagonOpenGateway_6
It worked. Let us proceed.
![[Eagon - EagonOpenGateway_6.ogg]]

#### EagonOpenGateway_10
The thread is revealed.
![[Eagon - EagonOpenGateway_10.ogg]]

#### EagonOpenGateway_14
As expected.
![[Eagon - EagonOpenGateway_14.ogg]]

#### EagonOpenGateway_19
Go now.
![[Eagon - EagonOpenGateway_19.ogg]]

#### Eagon_Wild_BossCallout_Random
Be careful!
![[Eagon - Eagon_Wild_BossCallout_Random.ogg]]

#### Eagon_Wild_BossCallout_4
Quickly - you must save her!
![[Eagon - Eagon_Wild_BossCallout_4.ogg]]

#### Eagon_Wild_BossCallout_7
She weakens. Hurry now!
![[Eagon - Eagon_Wild_BossCallout_7.ogg]]

#### Eagon_Wild_BossCallout_10
The time is now! Destroy this memory!
![[Eagon - Eagon_Wild_BossCallout_10.ogg]]

#### Eagon_Wild_BossCallout_12
Hurry, Exile! Lay waste to her tormentor!
![[Eagon - Eagon_Wild_BossCallout_12.ogg]]

#### Eagon_Wild_BossCallout_15
Protect her at all costs, Exile!
![[Eagon - Eagon_Wild_BossCallout_15.ogg]]

#### Eagon_Wild_BossCallout_18
Wait!
![[Eagon - Eagon_Wild_BossCallout_18.ogg]]

#### Eagon_Wild_BossCallout_21
Go!
![[Eagon - Eagon_Wild_BossCallout_21.ogg]]

#### Eagon_Wild_BossCallout_24
The balance tips in our favor!
![[Eagon - Eagon_Wild_BossCallout_24.ogg]]

#### Eagon_Wild_BossCallout_27
That's it, Exile! Don't stop now!
![[Eagon - Eagon_Wild_BossCallout_27.ogg]]

#### Eagon_Wild_BossKillCallout_Random
A sound execution!
![[Eagon - Eagon_Wild_BossKillCallout_Random.ogg]]

#### Eagon_Wild_BossKillCallout_4
It is done!.
![[Eagon - Eagon_Wild_BossKillCallout_4.ogg]]

#### Eagon_Wild_BossKillCallout_7
Well done!
![[Eagon - Eagon_Wild_BossKillCallout_7.ogg]]

#### Eagon_Wild_BossKillCallout_10
The horror recedes!
![[Eagon - Eagon_Wild_BossKillCallout_10.ogg]]

#### Eagon_Wild_BossKillCallout_13
Her mind is eased!
![[Eagon - Eagon_Wild_BossKillCallout_13.ogg]]

#### Eagon_Wild_BossKillCallout_16
You've done it!
![[Eagon - Eagon_Wild_BossKillCallout_16.ogg]]
