## Undertaker Arimor Dialogue
#### NecropolisNPCWildIntroduction
Hi, I'm Greg. There are a number of spirits haunting monsters throughout Wraeclast making them behave in abnormal ways and become even more dangerous. If you can help me by defeating them and calling upon me when you defeat monsters that are haunted by very powerful spirits. I can take them make to my cemetery and you can join me there so we can bury them and exorcise the spirits from them. Here take this, this is the Lantern of Arimor, it will allow you to see the Spirits and even manipulate them to haunt different monsters.

#### Introduction
An exile with a talent for killing? Colour me shocked. I'll make you the same offer I made the others. Take this lantern. I think you'll appreciate what you can see by its ghastly light. You go ahead and do what you do, and I'll collect the most interesting bodies you fell. Once you've got one, we'll talk...

#### UndertakerWildCollectFirstCorpse
Well well, this one's got quite the unfinished business.
![[Undertaker Arimor - UndertakerWildCollectFirstCorpse.ogg]]

#### The Necropolis
This corpse'll do. Full of anguish, just how we need. Keep making them, and I'll keep scooping them. When we've got enough, we can perform certain rites at the Necropolis... visit me, and there'll be something in it for you. No questions asked.
![[Undertaker Arimor - The Necropolis.ogg]]

#### UndertakerWildSummon_Random
It's dirty work, but somebody's gotta do it.
![[Undertaker Arimor - UndertakerWildSummon_Random.ogg]]

#### UndertakerWildSummon_4
Another day, another death.
![[Undertaker Arimor - UndertakerWildSummon_4.ogg]]

#### UndertakerWildSummon_7
The work continues!
![[Undertaker Arimor - UndertakerWildSummon_7.ogg]]

#### UndertakerWildSummon_9
What have you got for me today, exile?
![[Undertaker Arimor - UndertakerWildSummon_9.ogg]]

#### UndertakerWildSummon_12
More fodder for the pile.
![[Undertaker Arimor - UndertakerWildSummon_12.ogg]]

#### UndertakerWildSummon_15
This'll do nicely.
![[Undertaker Arimor - UndertakerWildSummon_15.ogg]]

#### UndertakerWildSummon_18
Oh, it's a ripe one!
![[Undertaker Arimor - UndertakerWildSummon_18.ogg]]

#### UndertakerWildSummon_20
Ugh.
![[Undertaker Arimor - UndertakerWildSummon_20.ogg]]

#### UndertakerWildSummon_23
Sometimes I tire of this job.
![[Undertaker Arimor - UndertakerWildSummon_23.ogg]]

#### UndertakerWildSummonMaps_Random
Where in the bloody boondocks have you taken us?
![[Undertaker Arimor - UndertakerWildSummonMaps_Random.ogg]]

#### UndertakerWildSummonMaps_4
How'd you find a corpse in all this misty emptiness? Oh... I see now... how strange...
![[Undertaker Arimor - UndertakerWildSummonMaps_4.ogg]]

#### UndertakerWildAlmostFull_Random
We're almost full up, exile. Might want to make use of our stored corpses. They're starting to... smell.
![[Undertaker Arimor - UndertakerWildAlmostFull_Random.ogg]]

#### UndertakerWildAlmostFull_3
Morgue's almost full, exile. Might want to take care of that.
![[Undertaker Arimor - UndertakerWildAlmostFull_3.ogg]]

#### UndertakerWildAlmostFull_5
Running out of room at the Necropolis...
![[Undertaker Arimor - UndertakerWildAlmostFull_5.ogg]]

#### UndertakerWildMorgueFull_Random
Got no more room in the morgue. Let's talk. See what we want to dump or keep.
![[Undertaker Arimor - UndertakerWildMorgueFull_Random.ogg]]

#### UndertakerWildMorgueFull_3
Morgue's full. What do you want me to do? We can dump some.
![[Undertaker Arimor - UndertakerWildMorgueFull_3.ogg]]

#### UndertakerWildMorgueFull_5
Dead man's locker is overflowing. Time to make some tough choices.
![[Undertaker Arimor - UndertakerWildMorgueFull_5.ogg]]

#### The Necropolis_2
Welcome to my little slice of Wraeclast, Exile. Got a morgue that can hold a number of bodies, but if it gets full, we'll have to choose what we want to keep. While you're here, we can do some burials... free some spirits. I think you'll be mighty interested in what happens when we do.
![[Undertaker Arimor - The Necropolis_2.ogg]]

#### Burial Patterns
When we bury our anguished friends, the pattern matters. Exorcisms are all about patterns, you see? Patterns of angst, patterns of pain... patterns of Corruption. Choose our plots carefully.
![[Undertaker Arimor - Burial Patterns.ogg]]

#### The Life of an Undertaker
You might call me the last true citizen of the Eternal Empire. Or you can call me Arimor, my actual name, but I suppose I do just call you Exile, so fair's fair. Most exiles don't live very long, so I don't bother learning names, but yours is... well, I'll just say, your parents must have been quite strange.
![[Undertaker Arimor - The Life of an Undertaker.ogg]]

#### Arimor's Lantern
It's no Allflame, but it gets the job done. Let's leave it at that.
![[Undertaker Arimor - Arimor's Lantern.ogg]]

#### The Job's Purpose
You don't really want to know. A withered old man, hanging out by himself in a graveyard, collecting corpses... I have to assume you're not {actually} asking... after all, none of the other exiles I work with have ever shown an interest.
![[Undertaker Arimor - The Job's Purpose.ogg]]

#### The Job's Purpose_2
I'm not up to anything nefarious or disgusting, I can promise you that. Best leave well enough alone.
![[Undertaker Arimor - The Job's Purpose_2.ogg]]

#### The Job's Purpose_3
What's this obsession with the meaning behind our work? Aren't the baubles unearthed here enough to satiate you? Just kill things, and stop asking questions!
![[Undertaker Arimor - The Job's Purpose_3.ogg]]

#### The Allflame
Is that... the Allflame? You've brought it {here?} Fool! Don't you know what the Allflame is capable of? Its long and storied history of tragedy and misery no, no, I shouldn't blame you. No way for an uncivilised exile to know. Just keep it away from me, and definitely don't let its light fall upon the graves! I'm sure even a wanderer like you has heard about {that} little disaster...
![[Undertaker Arimor - The Allflame.ogg]]

#### Exorcisms
You can pilfer shiny things from a corpse, but you can pilfer {glorious} things from a soul! Only source of plasm I've ever seen... love this old Wraeclast, I do... Damned fool he was, that Voll...
![[Undertaker Arimor - Exorcisms.ogg]]

#### Plasm
There's a white {goo} that comes off properly exorcised souls. I've got a colleague I correspond with, he calls them humors, but I don't see anything funny about it. He's got plots, too, though I don't know what it is he's scheming. He's a strange one, that. Never quite makes sense. Loves his plants, hates warlocks. Now, what were we talking about? I can't quite remember. Back to work, I suppose.
![[Undertaker Arimor - Plasm.ogg]]

#### Other Exiles
I've long had my fingers in quite a few... pies. I've learned to be discreet in my dealings, however. Few exiles can be truly trusted. There was a time when Torr Olgosso simply would not leave me alone. Everywhere I turned, there he was! He and I had to have a talk about boundaries... yes, boundaries... and I certainly did not appreciate Igna Phoenix accidentally setting my work on fire... but the greatest betrayal, of course... my former apprentice and I did not part on good terms, to put it mildly...
![[Undertaker Arimor - Other Exiles.ogg]]

#### Former Apprentice
Fancies herself a Master of Undeath these days... or would the term be Mistress of Undeath? No, that doesn't sound right... but she's meddling with forces beyond mortal control, and it will not end well for any of us. I won't betray her, though, no matter what she did to me. You'll have to find her yourself.
![[Undertaker Arimor - Former Apprentice.ogg]]

#### Catarina
It was you who slew Catarina? I suppose it had to be done. My former apprentice forged her own path, and her own doom. I begrudge you nothing. I did find and retrieve her body, but I'll not allow it to be part of this sordid business. Sod off. I've work to do... rites to perform...
![[Undertaker Arimor - Catarina.ogg]]

#### Emperor Chitus
Chitus could have led the Empire to greatness, had he not been viciously betrayed. He was a visionary! My line has worked tirelessly for three centuries to enact this ah, you clever fox! You almost had me spilling my secrets! The solitude really must be getting to me. This old man'll never talk!
![[Undertaker Arimor - Emperor Chitus.ogg]]
