## Aisling Laffrey Dialogue
#### AislingPrimaryDefenderStartsFightZero
By the time we're through, no one will be able to tell you were even human.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingPrimaryDefenderStartsFightZero.ogg]]

#### AislingPrimaryDefenderStartsFightOne
Do you know what happens to the lamb that wanders into the lion's den?
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingPrimaryDefenderStartsFightOne.ogg]]

#### AislingPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwo
Keep the cargo rolling. I'll be back soon enough.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwo.ogg]]

#### AislingPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThree
No one will find your body down here, exile. No one.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThree.ogg]]

#### AislingPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFour
Savour these last breaths!
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFour.ogg]]

#### AislingPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFive
I spent every moment behind those bars picturing what I'd do to you when I got out.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFive.ogg]]

#### AislingPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSix
This time it'll be you beggin' for your life.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSix.ogg]]

#### AislingPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSeven
Don't think it'll be like the last time, exile. No one's coming to save you.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingPrimaryDefenderStartsFightSeven.ogg]]

#### AislingPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEight
My death was quick. Yours won't be.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEight.ogg]]

#### AislingPrimaryDefenderStartsFightNine
You really don't get it, do you? I'm faster. I'm stronger.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingPrimaryDefenderStartsFightNine.ogg]]

#### AislingPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTen
I have never felt so free, exile. Can you say the same?
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTen.ogg]]

#### AislingPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEleven
Nothing is quite so invigorating as carnage.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingPrimaryDefenderStartsFightEleven.ogg]]

#### AislingPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwelve
Breathe deep the aromas of death.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingPrimaryDefenderStartsFightTwelve.ogg]]

#### AislingPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThirteen
I usually prefer to work alone, but my pack is hungry.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingPrimaryDefenderStartsFightThirteen.ogg]]

#### AislingPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFourteen
Feel the cold creep of death, exile? Give in to it!
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingPrimaryDefenderStartsFightFourteen.ogg]]

#### AislingSafehouseLeaderIntroZero
Look around you! This is the end of your journey, exile. The final stop!
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingSafehouseLeaderIntroZero.ogg]]

#### AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero
Keep 'em busy. Don't let them escape!
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero.ogg]]

#### AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne
You should've just minded your own business!
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne.ogg]]

#### AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo
You aren't leaving here alive.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo.ogg]]

#### AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree
You're only delaying the inevitable, exile.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree.ogg]]

#### AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour
I've been looking for someone to kill.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour.ogg]]

#### AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive
Shall we carve some fountains of blood to wet this thirsty ground, Vorici?
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive.ogg]]

#### AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix
Show me what beautiful cruelty your kind are capable of, demon!
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix.ogg]]

#### AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven
What I can do, dear General, will make you question your faith.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven.ogg]]

#### AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight
The quickest way to this woman's heart, Korell, is by carving out another's.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight.ogg]]

#### AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine
So clumsy, Cameria, but I love your enthusiasm.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine.ogg]]

#### AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalTen
Watch carefully. You might learn a thing or two.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalTen.ogg]]

#### AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalEleven
Sorry exile. End of the road.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalEleven.ogg]]

#### AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwelve
Now that everyone's here, the real fun can begin.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwelve.ogg]]

#### AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirteen
Not so fast. I'm taking over.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirteen.ogg]]

#### AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalFourteen
When this is over, there won't be any bodies left to revive.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalFourteen.ogg]]

#### AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalFifteen
Sorry, but I'm the only one leaving here alive.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalFifteen.ogg]]

#### AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalSixteen
I think I'll preserve your skin, Haku. Wouldn't want to waste those tattoos.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalSixteen.ogg]]

#### AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeventeen
Your scars are so beautiful, Redmane. Allow me to add a few.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeventeen.ogg]]

#### AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalEighteen
You're simply too hideous to live, aberration.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalEighteen.ogg]]

#### AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalNineteen
Such a large canvas to work upon, Hillock. I must thank you in advance.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalNineteen.ogg]]

#### AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwenty
You had your chance to impress me, Cameria. You didn't.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwenty.ogg]]

#### AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyOne
Don't you know? You should never anger an assassin.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyOne.ogg]]

#### AislingReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero
Spineless, slimy coward. I'll paint the walls red with your blood.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalZero.ogg]]

#### AislingReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne
Ah, I've been looking for a reason to kill you. Thanks.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalOne.ogg]]

#### AislingReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo
So be it. You can join the other cadavers.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwo.ogg]]

#### AislingReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree
I'm gonna tear you apart and feed you to the wolves.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalThree.ogg]]

#### AislingReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour
None of my subjects have ever objected, Vorici. Neither will you.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFour.ogg]]

#### AislingReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive
At least I wait until they're dead to defile the body.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalFive.ogg]]

#### AislingReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix
Then why just witness? Be my next muse.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSix.ogg]]

#### AislingReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven
Ha! Jealous?
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalSeven.ogg]]

#### AislingReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight
At least you recognize greatness when you see it.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalEight.ogg]]

#### AislingReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine
Even I feel ill at the thought of what I plan to do to you.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingReplyToSecondaryDefenderArrivalNine.ogg]]

#### AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyTwo
I love watching the hope fade from your eyes.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyTwo.ogg]]

#### AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyThree
Did you really think it would be that easy?
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyThree.ogg]]

#### AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFour
And just like that, your fate is sealed.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFour.ogg]]

#### AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFive
Don't be sad, exile. Your death will be very entertaining.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyFive.ogg]]

#### AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySix
I think you've secretly hoped to have me in charge, assassin.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySix.ogg]]

#### AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySeven
Don't fail me, demon. You know what I do to failures.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentySeven.ogg]]

#### AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyEight
I think you know my orders already, Gravicius.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyEight.ogg]]

#### AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyNine
Is that sweat I smell, Korell? Can you not handle your own heat?
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalTwentyNine.ogg]]

#### AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirty
My turn to lead the dance, Cameria.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirty.ogg]]

#### AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirtyOne
Far too many moving parts. Let's start removing 'em.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingSecondaryDefenderArrivalThirtyOne.ogg]]

#### AislingKillPlayerZero
Good. Get this cleaned up.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingKillPlayerZero.ogg]]

#### AislingKillPlayerOne
Keep moving.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingKillPlayerOne.ogg]]

#### AislingKillPlayerTwo
Let's finish up and get out of here.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingKillPlayerTwo.ogg]]

#### AislingKillPlayerThree
Too easy.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingKillPlayerThree.ogg]]

#### AislingEscapeZero
Satisfying.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingEscapeZero.ogg]]

#### AislingEscapeOne
Your death will have to wait.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingEscapeOne.ogg]]

#### AislingEscapeTwo
We're done here. See you soon.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingEscapeTwo.ogg]]

#### AislingDefeatedZero
What!? No!
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingDefeatedZero.ogg]]

#### AislingDefeatedOne
It can't be...!
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingDefeatedOne.ogg]]

#### AislingDefeatedTwo
No, not possible...!
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingDefeatedTwo.ogg]]

#### AislingDefeatedThree
But... I can't...!
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingDefeatedThree.ogg]]

#### AislingDefeatedFour
All that plannin'... for what?!
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingDefeatedFour.ogg]]

#### AislingDefeatedFive
Wait... another deal!
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingDefeatedFive.ogg]]

#### AislingDefeatedSix
No, not again!
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingDefeatedSix.ogg]]

#### AislingDefeatedSeven
Ugh... gets no easier, does it?
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingDefeatedSeven.ogg]]

#### AislingDefeatedEight
You... got... lucky...!
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingDefeatedEight.ogg]]

#### AislingDefeatedNine
How... unprofessional.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingDefeatedNine.ogg]]

#### AislingDefeatedTen
Ugh... careless!
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingDefeatedTen.ogg]]

#### AislingOfferBargainZero
I can appreciate a killer when I see one. You're a killer, but I think you'll get more out of keeping me alive. Just tell me what you want.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingOfferBargainZero.ogg]]

#### AislingOfferBargainOne
You could end my life. I would, were I in your position. But I have a better idea. Leave me alive, and I'll make sure certain Syndicate resources are... reallocated. Move enough bricks and perhaps the tower will come crashing down.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingOfferBargainOne.ogg]]

#### AislingOfferBargainTwo
Are you gonna kill me? No... you're after someone higher up. Problem is, no single person has the information you need. Let me reunite with a colleague of mine, and I'll make sure you get closer to the top.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingOfferBargainTwo.ogg]]

#### AislingOfferBargainThree
I know you want to kill me. I would, too. But we are like the mythical hydra: cut off one head, two more will grow. But get those long necks in a tangle... well, you get the idea. I walk out of here alive, and maybe I find myself a new job.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingOfferBargainThree.ogg]]

#### AislingOfferBargainFour
You know, I've been considerin' an early retirement. Tired of this cat and mouse game. Tired of fightin'. Aren't you? How about we call it even, and go our separate ways?
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingOfferBargainFour.ogg]]

#### AislingOfferBargainFive
Look, I know what you're really after. You're not after some lackey. That's all I am. You want the boss. I can give them to you, but not if I'm dead. How 'bout it?
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingOfferBargainFive.ogg]]

#### AislingOfferBargainSix
You've won the battle, exile, but the war rages on. Do you want to know what wins wars? Weapons. Let me go, and I'll give you the tools you so desperately need.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingOfferBargainSix.ogg]]

#### AislingBargainAcceptedZero
The foundations are shiftin', exile, but I doubt you'll bring the tower down.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingBargainAcceptedZero.ogg]]

#### AislingBargainAcceptedOne
You're startin' to figure it out, aren't you? I can see it in your eyes. But there's more going on than you could possibly fathom.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingBargainAcceptedOne.ogg]]

#### AislingBargainAcceptedTwo
The Syndicate was in dire need of a shake-up anyway, exile. You've achieved nothing.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingBargainAcceptedTwo.ogg]]

#### AislingBargainAcceptedThree
You know, now that I think about it, I'm too young to retire. But I could certainly use a break! See you soon, exile.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingBargainAcceptedThree.ogg]]

#### AislingBargainAcceptedFour
The question now, exile, is whether or not you're foolish enough to face 'em down. I think you just might be.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingBargainAcceptedFour.ogg]]

#### AislingBargainAcceptedFive
Take them. They're yours. There's plenty more where that came from, but I don't expect you'll be getting them.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingBargainAcceptedFive.ogg]]

#### AislingOfferBetrayalZero
You won fair and square, even with my boss here. I happen to know that they've been pocketing some of the Syndicate's more valuable acquisitions. What do you think will happen when I tell the Lifegiver?
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingOfferBetrayalZero.ogg]]

#### AislingOfferBetrayalOne
Executin' us brings you no closer to the Lifegiver. But let us live, and I will ensure those at the top 'ear about the many failings of those who've fought here today... excludin' myself, of course.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingOfferBetrayalOne.ogg]]

#### AislingOfferBetrayalTwo
The Syndicate deals with its failures itself, but sometimes it takes an outsider's perspective to see where we went wrong. Tell me, who do you think is deserving of our... punishment? I promise you will not be seeing their face again anytime soon.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingOfferBetrayalTwo.ogg]]

#### AislingOfferBetrayalThree
Well, this was clearly a mistake. I was... misinformed about the suitability of this mission by my allies. But I know some things they don't know I know. Would you like to know them? Let me go, and that information is all yours.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingOfferBetrayalThree.ogg]]

#### AislingOfferBetrayalFour
I 'ave no qualms whatsoever about betrayin' Leo, if that is what you desire.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingOfferBetrayalFour.ogg]]

#### AislingOfferBetrayalFive
Tora sees the necessity in violence, but not the beauty. Allow me to re-educate her.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingOfferBetrayalFive.ogg]]

#### AislingOfferBetrayalSix
Vagan is all show and no substance. I think he needs to experience a hardship or two, and I want to deliver them to him.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingOfferBetrayalSix.ogg]]

#### AislingOfferBetrayalSeven
You want me to betray that... thing? I'll do it. Even if you weren't askin'. But since you are...
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingOfferBetrayalSeven.ogg]]

#### AislingOfferBetrayalEight
Hillock has very little idea as to what is going on at any given moment. That makes him dangerous.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingOfferBetrayalEight.ogg]]

#### AislingOfferBetrayalNine
Cold-blooded betrayal. That's what I offer.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingOfferBetrayalNine.ogg]]

#### AislingOfferExecuteZero
Go on, do it. You're no stranger to murder. Just make it quick.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingOfferExecuteZero.ogg]]

#### AislingOfferExecuteOne
Some promises are stronger than death, exile. Make it quick.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingOfferExecuteOne.ogg]]

#### AislingOfferExecuteTwo
You think I'll beg for my life in front of a fellow member? Ha. Make it quick.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingOfferExecuteTwo.ogg]]

#### AislingOfferExecuteThree
I'll sooner die than let you lock me up again. If you won't kill me, I will.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingOfferExecuteThree.ogg]]

#### AislingReplyToBetrayalAcceptedZero
Pathetic. Shoulda killed you first.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingReplyToBetrayalAcceptedZero.ogg]]

#### AislingReplyToBetrayalAcceptedOne
Nothing you do can bother me, Haku, but thank you for the compliment.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingReplyToBetrayalAcceptedOne.ogg]]

#### AislingReplyToBetrayalAcceptedTwo
Haha haha haha haha ha-hah!
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingReplyToBetrayalAcceptedTwo.ogg]]

#### AislingReplyToBetrayalAcceptedThree
I've seen your work, Vorici. I'm not sure you know what 'worse' means.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingReplyToBetrayalAcceptedThree.ogg]]

#### AislingReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFour
Everyone's a critic.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFour.ogg]]

#### AislingReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFive
I know exactly where I want to mount your scalp, traitor.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingReplyToBetrayalAcceptedFive.ogg]]

#### AislingReplyToBetrayalAcceptedSix
Maloney, I think it's time I put you in better contact with your own fleshy pink humanity.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingReplyToBetrayalAcceptedSix.ogg]]

#### AislingInterrogatedZero
If you think I'll talk, you're sorely mistaken.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingInterrogatedZero.ogg]]

#### AislingInterrogatedOne
No... not again! Please! Not again!
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingInterrogatedOne.ogg]]

#### AislingInterrogatedTwo
What? No! No, we had a deal!
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingInterrogatedTwo.ogg]]

#### AislingReplyToExecutionZero
I'da made a little more show of it.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingReplyToExecutionZero.ogg]]

#### AislingReplyToExecutionOne
This wasn't personal until just now.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingReplyToExecutionOne.ogg]]

#### AislingReplyToExecutionTwo
Good riddance.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingReplyToExecutionTwo.ogg]]

#### AislingSafehouseLeaderDefeatedZero
You may have claimed this victory, but we will rise again. You cannot win, exile. Not forever.
![[Aisling Laffrey - AislingSafehouseLeaderDefeatedZero.ogg]]
