## Atalui Priestess Dialogue
#### Atalui_G3_16_Seven_Sided_Strike
There is no escape!

#### Atalui_G3_16_Seven_Sided_Strike2
I shall rend your flesh asunder!

#### Atalui_G3_16_Melee_Combo
Torn flesh!

#### Atalui_G3_16_On_Aggro
Who dares defy the will of Atziri?

#### Atalui_G3_16_Body_Swap
Brother!

#### Atalui_G3_16_Raise_Elemental
You will suffer for this!

#### Atalui_G3_16_Take_Blood
Use my strength, brother!

#### Atalui_G3_16_On_Death
Atziri!

#### Atalui_G3_16_On_Death2
My Queen... take my soul...

#### Ritual Altars
Those primitive altars... they are not Vaal. In the last days before the fall, there were complaints about their mysterious appearance on the fringes of our Empire. An opportunist seeks to take advantage of the moment, a so-called 'King in the Mists'. To pay tribute at those altars, is to give some measure of power to a being with an unknown agenda... Make a deal for paltry trinkets if you wish, but be prepared to someday face the consequences.

#### Porcelain Queen
We studied and archived much of the world's knowledge in the Library of Kamasa. I read a book there before my Trial. It detailed the story of a Porcelain Queen, a mother-beast of the Nameless, who offended our adored Arakaali. The symbology and context of the Porcelain Queen bears similarity to the altars and cultists of this 'King in the Mists.' If he is like her, then he comes from our reality's non-possibility space, the realm of the Nameless.

#### Audience with the King
Ahahah... an Audience with the King... how arrogant an invitation! I have no idea what this 'King in the Mists' wants with you, but he believes he is untouchable at the Crux of Nothingness. He's made a mistake... in drawing us ever closer, he has been able to intrude into our world... but so, too, does our world intrude into his. You should attend this meeting. Give him the humbling he deserves.

#### AtaluiOnFailingCruxOfNothingness
I take it that diplomacy failed with the King in the Mists. Not unexpected. I didn't think you would take such a beating, though. You've rather embarrassed us, haven't you? Find a way back to the Crux of Nothingness. You must do better next time.

#### The King in the Mists
Haha! Ah, I wish I could have been there to see the look on that so-called 'King's' face when you kicked him into the dirt. Remain vigilant. He will be back. The Nameless have been trying to steal meaning from us for countless centuries now, and they're not about to stop because of just one humiliation.

#### The Realm of the Nameless
How do I explain this to someone unschooled? Ugh, hm... our Lord Chaos, for example, is an entity intrinsically tied to all that might be. Chaos sees what {can} happen. The void of the Nameless is not the opposite of that, but rather, the inverse... it is all that {cannot} happen. Consider you and I becoming friends. That will {never} happen in our world... and thus, you might find that friendship in the realm of the Nameless.

#### Consequences
The consequences of gifting your faith to the King in the Mists... hmm... that depends on how far he is willing to go. His altars are like a carpenter's screws, driven through separate realms, turning slowly, bringing us closer together. I gather, from what I read in the Library at least, that the Nameless primarily seek the simple right to exist. That does not necessarily put us at odds... but I can guess at countless ways that might cause conflict. If you had children, would {you} let them play with a Nameless changeling? Be taught alongside one? Ugh...

#### AtaluiOnDreams
Dreams? No... no, not I... I've never done anything wrong... I've always been a perfect daughter of the Vaal... done everything I was asked, and excelled... Every single sacrifice I ever made... they volunteered. It was voluntary, right? It was! Leave me be...
![[Atalui Priestess - AtaluiOnDreams - 1.ogg]]
![[Atalui Priestess - AtaluiOnDreams - 2.ogg]]

#### The Trial of Chaos
I did not undertake the Trial alone, but I did emerge a victor. I earned myself the role of High Priestess, as is custom. Had I possessed less willpower and skill, I would have earned a role that was... less important. I would be dead now, out there, with the rest of the chaff, rather than here serving Doryani. You should ask him about his Trial. His strategy caused quite the stir... but it made Chaos laugh, so it worked.

#### Alva
After intensively discussing her bloodline, I have determined that Alva technically qualifies as Vaal. She has vouched for you as her ally. I respect you enough to tell you that we will likely be enemies when this is all over. Until then, I will collaborate with you as best I can.
![[Atalui Priestess - Alva - 1.ogg]]
![[Atalui Priestess - Alva - 2.ogg]]

#### Alva_2
After intensively discussing her bloodline, I have determined that Alva technically qualifies as Vaal. She is one of us, and you are most welcome here, Azmeri.
![[Atalui Priestess - Alva_2.ogg]]

#### Alva_3
You are not worthy to speak to me on your own. However, after intensively discussing her bloodline, I have determined that Alva technically qualifies as Vaal. She has vouched for you as her servant, so... I will speak to you, if you insist.
![[Atalui Priestess - Alva_3.ogg]]

#### AtaluiOnWorthyNoSorcNoAzmeri
Do not think me base, or callous. I do not judge you based on your appearance. It is your culture that disgusts me. I understand that you come from some future era that is unknown to us, but here, in the Wraeclast I know, the Vaal are surrounded by savages. Their propensity to pillage, burn, and commit... other atrocities... is held back only by the might of our vigilant armies. We are the peacekeepers of this world. Or... we were...
![[Atalui Priestess - AtaluiOnWorthyNoSorcNoAzmeri - 1.ogg]]
![[Atalui Priestess - AtaluiOnWorthyNoSorcNoAzmeri - 2.ogg]]

#### The Maraketh
I can respect the militaristic traditions of your people, while remaining wary. Our merchants trade with your merchants, and all the nobles wear smiles and clasp arms, but it is impossible to forget the spears bristling behind those masks of civility. We Vaal are the peacekeepers of this world, and we will not allow your expanding imperium to oh. Of course. An old argument, that likely doesn't matter anymore...
![[Atalui Priestess - The Maraketh - 1.ogg]]
![[Atalui Priestess - The Maraketh - 2.ogg]]

#### The Maraketh_2
Of all the cultures that surround us, those of the Vastiri are the closest to what might be called a neighbouring empire. As much as I distrust them, I do hope they survived the Cataclysm. There has to be someone still alive out there...
![[Atalui Priestess - The Maraketh_2.ogg]]

#### The Karui
Your sea tribes are largely a mystery to us. We rarely concern ourselves with sailing. Some of our merchants did trade for your jade, though they learned to enact such exchanges indirectly. Your people too often carry disease the blood fever your kind struggle with is why I prefer you not to stand too close to me.

![[Atalui Priestess - The Karui - 2.ogg]]

#### The Karui_2
The sea tribes are largely a mystery to us. We rarely concern ourselves with sailing. Some of our merchants did trade for their jade, though they learned to enact such exchanges indirectly. The Karui too often carry disease a strange blood fever that drives them into a rage, especially if our merchants linger in their presence. Keeping the Karui at a distance is merely a sensible precaution.

![[Atalui Priestess - The Karui_2 - 2.ogg]]

#### The Ezomytes
What is an 'Ezomyte?' I have never heard of such a people. You claim to be an Ezomyte, yet you appear, to my eyes, to be Karui. I suppose I should avoid... assumptions.
![[Atalui Priestess - The Ezomytes.ogg]]

#### The Ezomytes_2
What is an 'Ezomyte?' I have never heard of such a people. You don't mean the Caaltu, do you? No, no, that wouldn't make sense...
![[Atalui Priestess - The Ezomytes_2.ogg]]

#### Trarthus
Trarthus never changes. If they still live, I doubt they've noticed this 'Cataclysm' at all. Too sedated from their favourite vapours... pathetic.
![[Atalui Priestess - Trarthus.ogg]]

#### The Azmeri
I can only hope your people have been protected from this disaster by the high walls of your mountain valleys. Your culture is the only one on Wraeclast that I do not find... distasteful. Your people remind me of how the Vaal must once have been. Astute, kind, and wise, but new to the ways of the world.
![[Atalui Priestess - The Azmeri - 1.ogg]]
![[Atalui Priestess - The Azmeri - 2.ogg]]

#### The Azmeri_2
I can only hope the Azmeri have been protected from this disaster by the high walls of their mountain valleys. They alone are the sole culture on Wraeclast that I do not find... distasteful. They remind me of how the Vaal must once have been. Astute, kind, and wise, but new to the ways of the world.
![[Atalui Priestess - The Azmeri_2 - 1.ogg]]
![[Atalui Priestess - The Azmeri_2 - 2.ogg]]

#### Oriath
A small cult makes their home on that island. They were banished from the Azmeri at some point. They must have been far enough away to survive the Cataclysm, because you are here before me. Or, so I assume. Ketzuli would better understand the structure of Time.
![[Atalui Priestess - Oriath.ogg]]

#### Oriath_2
A small cult makes their home on that island. They were banished from the Azmeri at some point. They may be far enough away to have survived the Cataclysm.
![[Atalui Priestess - Oriath_2.ogg]]

#### Primevals
Very little survived of the culture we call the Primevals. They left only glyphs and carvings. There were a few figures of note in the books I studied. Uzaza was likely their First King. Aul, called their Last King, overthrew a tyrant named Putembo... or so I believe. There was Ahkeli, too, who the Maraketh would know more about than I. Unlike many other cultures, their ruins are often found in the ash layer itself. It's no wonder only stone remnants remain.
![[Atalui Priestess - Primevals - 1.ogg]]
![[Atalui Priestess - Primevals - 2.ogg]]

#### Precursors
Ah, yes, the only culture on the surface of Wraeclast whose ruins predate the ash layer... older to us than we are to you, if you can picture such an immense span of time. Doryani has been studying them in secret for years. It wouldn't be my place to speak on that, for the fate of the Vaal may still hinge on his knowledge.

#### AtaluiVendor_Buy_Random
It is yours.
![[Atalui Priestess - AtaluiVendor_Buy_Random.ogg]]

#### AtaluiVendor_Buy_4
I suppose it suits you.
![[Atalui Priestess - AtaluiVendor_Buy_4.ogg]]

#### AtaluiVendor_Buy_7
As you wish.
![[Atalui Priestess - AtaluiVendor_Buy_7.ogg]]

#### AtaluiVendor_Buy_10
May it serve you well.
![[Atalui Priestess - AtaluiVendor_Buy_10.ogg]]

#### AtaluiVendor_CloseShopNoBuy_Random
Perhaps another time.
![[Atalui Priestess - AtaluiVendor_CloseShopNoBuy_Random.ogg]]

#### AtaluiVendor_CloseShopNoBuy_4
I'll have more to choose from soon.
![[Atalui Priestess - AtaluiVendor_CloseShopNoBuy_4.ogg]]

#### AtaluiVendor_CloseShopNoBuy_7
There is no rush to decide.
![[Atalui Priestess - AtaluiVendor_CloseShopNoBuy_7.ogg]]

#### AtaluiVendor_CloseShopNoBuy_10
Later then.
![[Atalui Priestess - AtaluiVendor_CloseShopNoBuy_10.ogg]]

#### AtaluiVendor_OpenShop_Random
This is what we have available.
![[Atalui Priestess - AtaluiVendor_OpenShop_Random.ogg]]

#### AtaluiVendor_OpenShop_4
Here is the equipment I have... salvaged.
![[Atalui Priestess - AtaluiVendor_OpenShop_4.ogg]]

#### AtaluiVendor_OpenShop_7
Take your time.
![[Atalui Priestess - AtaluiVendor_OpenShop_7.ogg]]

#### AtaluiVendor_OpenShop_10
What do you think?
![[Atalui Priestess - AtaluiVendor_OpenShop_10.ogg]]

#### AtaluiVendor_Sell_Random
Deal.
![[Atalui Priestess - AtaluiVendor_Sell_Random.ogg]]

#### AtaluiVendor_Sell_4
I'll find a use for it.
![[Atalui Priestess - AtaluiVendor_Sell_4.ogg]]

#### AtaluiVendor_Sell_7
I'll take it.
![[Atalui Priestess - AtaluiVendor_Sell_7.ogg]]

#### AtaluiVendor_Sell_10
Don't spend it all at once.
![[Atalui Priestess - AtaluiVendor_Sell_10.ogg]]
