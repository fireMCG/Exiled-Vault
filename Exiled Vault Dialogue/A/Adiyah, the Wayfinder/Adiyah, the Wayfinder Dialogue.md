## Adiyah, the Wayfinder Dialogue
#### ExitBanterTullinaAdiyahReply
I can get you to a stale mead and several scattered lanterns. Will that suffice?

#### ExitBanterAdiyahToTullina
Another victory for crime.
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - ExitBanterAdiyahToTullina.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterAdiyahToTullinaTwo
No. That was... That was about something else. Please return now.

I am Adiyah. I will enable your travel to and from locations of interest.
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - Introduction_2.ogg]]

#### AdiyahHarbourForFemale
This place runs foul with thieves, cutthroats, and loudmouths. They cannot be trusted. You and I will have to work together to avoid errant knives.
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - AdiyahHarbourForFemale.ogg]]

#### AdiyahHarbourForMale
This place runs foul with thieves, cutthroats, and loudmouths. I am likely the only one here that would not betray you for coin.
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - AdiyahHarbourForMale.ogg]]

#### The Boss
I once served a worthy Sekhema. The Boss is no Sekhema. He rules through deception, obfuscation, and manipulation. However, if he agrees to do something, he will do it. That in itself is a form of honour which I can respect. He expects the same of us. In exchange for a place here, I have agreed to use my skills to enable the travels of this wretched heap of rhoa dung, and that is what I will do. My word is my bond.

I hope everyone knows the plan.

Time to return home.
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - AdiyahLeavingOne.ogg]]

At your leisure.
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - AdiyahLeavingTwo.ogg]]

#### AdiyahLeavingThree
You succeeded, I take it?
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - AdiyahLeavingThree.ogg]]

#### AdiyahCombatStartOne
I shall handle this.
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - AdiyahCombatStartOne.ogg]]

#### AdiyahCombatStartTwo
They have chosen death.
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - AdiyahCombatStartTwo.ogg]]

#### AdiyahCombatStartThree
Only fools challenge a veteran {dekhara}.
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - AdiyahCombatStartThree.ogg]]

#### AdiyahCombatEndOne
They never stood a chance.
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - AdiyahCombatEndOne.ogg]]

Onward.
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - AdiyahCombatEndTwo.ogg]]

I am uninjured. I can continue.

Victory was never in doubt.
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - AdiyahCombatEndFive.ogg]]

#### AdiyahCombatEndSix
We must move on.
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - AdiyahCombatEndSix.ogg]]

#### AdiyahCombatSkillOneA
Sun's fury!
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - AdiyahCombatSkillOneA.ogg]]

#### AdiyahCombatSkillTwoA
Desert heat!
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - AdiyahCombatSkillTwoA.ogg]]

#### AdiyahCombatSkillThreeA
Heart's flame!
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - AdiyahCombatSkillThreeA.ogg]]

#### A Matter of Honour
This contract touches upon my very reason for being here. It concerns my sister, Nashta, and a Spear. Growing up, Nashta was unable to follow the traditions of our people. She chafed at the rules. She earned many tattoos of shame for her violations, and each time she was punished, she only grew more rebellious. Not long ago, she fled from the Plains of Vastiri entirely, and scores of delinquents went with her. They have since terrorised many with their banditry, but duty required I track her down when she stole Solerai's Spear from a Sarn merchant of ill repute. I live among these thieves and scoundrels because this is her world, and in this place I hear more about her activities in a single moon than I would in a year spent looking for her on my own. We must retrieve the Spear. We cannot allow her to wield a weapon of Maraketh tradition in so disrespectful a manner. This is my duty, as Nashta is my sister. This contract makes it your duty as well.
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - A Matter of Honour.ogg]]

#### A Matter of Honour_2
This Spear is a tremendous weapon, one fit for a goddess. The merchant Hargan expects its return, but he shall be disappointed. When I bring it home to my {akhara}, our honour will be partially restored in the eyes of our fellow warriors. You did well, Exile.
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - A Matter of Honour_2.ogg]]

#### Flying False Colours
My sister, Nashta, and her bandits have responded to our retrieval of Solerai's Spear by targeting their raids against other Maraketh caravans. That in itself is not shameful, but she is doing so while wearing the colours of my {akhara}. She is trying to start a war among our people, and we can hardly afford conflict when our survival already hangs by a thread. You and I must infiltrate her stronghold and retrieve her war plans. With that proof, we can ensure that the Sekhemas know who is truly to blame.
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - Flying False Colours.ogg]]

#### Flying False Colours_2
This war journal contains exactly what I hoped. This, combined with my word, should be enough for the Sekhemas to believe that Nashta is acting on her own. I thank you, Exile.
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - Flying False Colours_2.ogg]]

#### Bad Blood
I know my sister. Nashta responds to adversity by invigorating her resistance, not backing down. We retrieved Solerai's Spear and thwarted her attempt to spark a civil war among the Maraketh, but that will only cause her to up the scale of her banditry. We must face her before she causes a disaster that our people can ill afford in these dangerous times. This will not be a matter of stealth, exile. Be prepared to fight if she will not listen to words.
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - Bad Blood.ogg]]

#### AdiyahContractThreeToNashta
Nashta! It is time to come home.
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - AdiyahContractThreeToNashta.ogg]]

#### AdiyahContractThreeToNashtaTwo
You could {try}.
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - AdiyahContractThreeToNashtaTwo.ogg]]

#### AdiyahContractThreeToNashtaThree
I understand. I will give you the only freedom I can.
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - AdiyahContractThreeToNashtaThree.ogg]]

#### AdiyahContractThreeToNashtaFour
You fought well, Nashta. I am proud of you.
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - AdiyahContractThreeToNashtaFour.ogg]]

#### Bad Blood_2
This was the best end I could have wished for Nashta. I think it was what she always wanted: not to live under the heavy oppression of a rigid set of rules, but to die fighting, as a true {dekhara}. In death, by standing and fighting, she has cleared her shame. She will be remembered as a woman filled with the irrepressible spirit of the warrior, one with so much aggression that she had no place in this civilised world. I will retrieve her body. Leave me now. I have some final things to say to my sister that are not for a {jingakh} to hear. Go well, my friend.
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - Bad Blood_2.ogg]]

#### Nenet
Nenet is from a people that currently call themselves the Faridun. They are our rejects. Those we Maraketh left to die in the desert as children for being unworthy or flawed. I do not think ill of Nenet. I do not think of her at all. I am not cruel, exile. It is simply that scattered groups of pariahs wandering in the desert have no effect on the world. She will not find the home she yearns for among these scoundrels.
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - Nenet.ogg]]

#### Home
I prefer not to name my {akhara} in the presence of these persons of ill repute, but I can say that I am from the northern reaches of the Plains of Vastiri. My home caravan has ninety-two carts, all of which are beautifully set with colourful tapestries and shaped metal. It is a life and land unlike this one. Difficult, duty-bound, but rewarding. I will return there someday, when my duty here is at an end. I still owe a debt to the Boss for allowing me a place here. Nashta may be dead, but I will stay here for a few more moons.
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - Home.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterTibbsAdiyahReply
This way, Mr Tibbs. A warm bath awaits you.
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - ExitBanterTibbsAdiyahReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterTibbsAdiyahReplyTwo
We are not strangers. Countless bubbles.
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - ExitBanterTibbsAdiyahReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterAdiyahToTibbs
It appears you met great success.
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - ExitBanterAdiyahToTibbs.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterAdiyahToTibbsTwo
I am pleased for you, Mr Tibbs.
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - ExitBanterAdiyahToTibbsTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterIslaAdiyahReply
Perfectly?
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - ExitBanterIslaAdiyahReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterIslaAdiyahReplyTwo
Indeed.
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - ExitBanterIslaAdiyahReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterAdiyahToIsla
I trust all went well?
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - ExitBanterAdiyahToIsla.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterAdiyahToIslaTwo
So... yes?
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - ExitBanterAdiyahToIslaTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterNenetAdiyahReply
Not personally. I prefer to cook and eat them.
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - ExitBanterNenetAdiyahReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterNenetAdiyahReplyTwo
I was being facetious.
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - ExitBanterNenetAdiyahReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterAdiyahToNenet
Why do you hide your face, Faridun?
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - ExitBanterAdiyahToNenet.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterAdiyahToNenetTwo
Certainly it cannot be that bad?
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - ExitBanterAdiyahToNenetTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterAdiyahToNenetThree
The desert is a harsh Sekhema.
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - ExitBanterAdiyahToNenetThree.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterNilesAdiyahReply
I believe it's called discipline.
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - ExitBanterNilesAdiyahReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterNilesAdiyahReplyTwo
Templar scum!
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - ExitBanterNilesAdiyahReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterAdiyahToNiles
Niles, do you still reject the gods?
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - ExitBanterAdiyahToNiles.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterAdiyahToNilesTwo
But... they do exist...
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - ExitBanterAdiyahToNilesTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterVinderiAdiyahReply
I do. I use it sparingly.
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - ExitBanterVinderiAdiyahReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterVinderiAdiyahReplyTwo
I prefer not to answer that.
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - ExitBanterVinderiAdiyahReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterAdiyahToVinderi
How did your explosions fare, Vinderi?
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - ExitBanterAdiyahToVinderi.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterGiannaAdiyahReply
No.
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - ExitBanterGiannaAdiyahReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterGiannaAdiyahReplyTwo
Yes... No.
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - ExitBanterGiannaAdiyahReplyTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterAdiyahToGianna
Who were you today, Gianna?
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - ExitBanterAdiyahToGianna.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterAdiyahToHuck
Commendable discipline, Mr. Huck.
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - ExitBanterAdiyahToHuck.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterAdiyahToHuckTwo
Yes, Mr. Huck.
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - ExitBanterAdiyahToHuckTwo.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterKarstAdiyahReply
Of course. It is my duty.
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - ExitBanterKarstAdiyahReply.ogg]]

#### ExitBanterAdiyahToKarst
Did it go as planned? Any injuries? Karst?
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - ExitBanterAdiyahToKarst.ogg]]

#### OtherBanterWhakanoAdiyahReply
I do not have tattoos, Karui, because they are marks of shame or criminality.
![[Adiyah, the Wayfinder - OtherBanterWhakanoAdiyahReply.ogg]]
