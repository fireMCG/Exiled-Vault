## Catarina, Master of Undeath Dialogue

Don't do this, Exile. You can still join us. It's your chance to bring back anyone you've ever loved or cared about.

Stop... I can bring them back. Jun, I can bring your entire order back! Just give me-

You found me at last... Very resourceful, Jun. I too am resourceful. Witness.

#### CatarinaCombatEight
Give in, Jun!
![[Catarina, Master of Undeath - CatarinaCombatEight.ogg]]

See? We are no different, you and I. We've both slain your pathetic little order. Though, they put up more of a fight the second time around.
![[Catarina, Master of Undeath - CatarinaVaultMiddle.ogg]]

#### CatarinaVaultFleeing
There's nothing that makes you feel so alive as death, is there...? Now, come to me Jun. Let us see what your soul is made of.
![[Catarina, Master of Undeath - CatarinaVaultFleeing.ogg]]

#### CatarinaVaultCemeteryIntro
Hundreds of dead, rotting soulless in the earth. What a meaningless waste. But your souls... yours will serve.

You try and try and try to break us, and yet the Syndicate is immortal. Do you think this will end any differently?

Your hopeless cause will destroy you!

#### CatarinaPhaseFour
I will imprison your soul forever!
![[Catarina, Master of Undeath - CatarinaPhaseFour.ogg]]

#### CatarinaGravicius
Your faith was a veil for your base desires. Hypocrite, you are lucky your soul isn't going to your God.
![[Catarina, Master of Undeath - CatarinaGravicius.ogg]]

#### CatarinaThane
Any system of belief, taken too far, can end in tragedy. Go to your brother now, Thane.

Can you hear them, Aisling? The souls of those you mutilated scream for your death. At last, their wish is granted.

Your ancestors are waiting for you Haku, but you will not see them. For this, I am sorry, old friend.

How many did you send to an unexpected death, assassin? Look into my eyes... Goodbye, Vorici.

Such a long, faithful life you've lived. I'm sorry you will never get to see your God, Elreon.

We were not so different, Tora. We both killed for the good of Wraeclast. But now your hunt is over.

#### CatarinaVagan
You are owed a warrior's death, but the needs of the cause outweigh your own, Vagan. I take no pleasure in this.
![[Catarina, Master of Undeath - CatarinaVagan.ogg]]

#### CatarinaGuff
Guff, Your Brinerot took much of value from the people of Wraeclast. It is only fitting that you have something valuable taken from you.

Without you, Janus, the Syndicate would never have formed, and for that, I must thank you. But you will not be missed.
