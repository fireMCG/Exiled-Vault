#### Ikiaho's Defeat
You humbled Ikiaho! While she's feeling down, perhaps I'll once again ask her to go through the traditions with me. What's the worst she could say?
![[Kiloava - Ikiaho's Defeat.ogg]]

#### Ikiaho's Victory
Nobody thaws the frozen heart, as they say.
![[Kiloava - Ikiaho's Victory.ogg]]

#### Kaom's Defeat
Ha ha! Kaom of legend, humiliated! What a match!
![[Kiloava - Kaom's Defeat.ogg]]

Of course you lost to Kaom. He's {Kaom}. Why did you even fight him?
![[Kiloava - Kaom's Victory.ogg]]

#### Maata's Defeat
Congratulations on beating up an old man.
![[Kiloava - Maata's Defeat.ogg]]

#### Maata's Victory
Ha ha! You got thrashed by an old man! I never thought I'd live to see the day.
![[Kiloava - Maata's Victory.ogg]]

#### Ahuana's Defeat
You haven't humbled Ahuana. She was a great leader of the united Karui tribes. You can't even begin to bother her.
![[Kiloava - Ahuana's Defeat.ogg]]

#### Ahuana's Victory
Ahuana can't be matched! Arrow in the eye! Yeah!
![[Kiloava - Ahuana's Victory.ogg]]

#### Akoya's Defeat
You only defeated Akoya because she plays fair. Remember that.
![[Kiloava - Akoya's Defeat.ogg]]

#### Akoya's Victory
Akoya! Now there's a Karui woman! What strength!
![[Kiloava - Akoya's Victory.ogg]]

#### Kiloava's Defeat
You and I both know you cheated against me. Don't speak to me like you're a real competitor.
![[Kiloava - Kiloava's Defeat.ogg]]

#### Kiloava's Victory
Ha ha, outsider, I {destroyed} you!
![[Kiloava - Kiloava's Victory.ogg]]

#### Match Victory
That was a decent match to watch. You're something of a warrior. Just something. Don't get an ego.
![[Kiloava - Match Victory.ogg]]

#### Match Loss
That defeat must sting! You got crushed!
![[Kiloava - Match Loss.ogg]]

#### KiloavaCommentOnPurchaseItemAkoya
Akoya! Akoya! Yeah!
![[Kiloava - KiloavaCommentOnPurchaseItemAkoya.ogg]]

#### KiloavaCommentOnPurchaseItemAhuana
The Ramako Tribe knows how to make the good things!
![[Kiloava - KiloavaCommentOnPurchaseItemAhuana.ogg]]

#### KiloavaCommentOnPurchaseEliteAkoya
Don't fight me with that.
![[Kiloava - KiloavaCommentOnPurchaseEliteAkoya.ogg]]

#### KiloavaCommentOnPurchaseEliteAhuana
Nobody can stand against Ahuana's warriors!
![[Kiloava - KiloavaCommentOnPurchaseEliteAhuana.ogg]]

#### KiloavaConversationWithAkoyaOne
I am furious! This is an insult to all of us!
![[Kiloava - KiloavaConversationWithAkoyaOne.ogg]]

#### KiloavaConversationWithAhuanaOne
Do you think you will ever reach perfection with a bow, Ahuana?
![[Kiloava - KiloavaConversationWithAhuanaOne.ogg]]

#### KiloavaConversationWithAhuanaTwo
I don't know about that. I'm perfect with my weapon.
![[Kiloava - KiloavaConversationWithAhuanaTwo.ogg]]

#### KiloavaConversationWithAhuanaThree
Sometimes, you're so positive, I think you're actually mocking you know what? I'll just accept the compliment.
![[Kiloava - KiloavaConversationWithAhuanaThree.ogg]]

#### KiloavaRandomShout1
I am the greatest warrior of all time!
![[Kiloava - KiloavaRandomShout1.ogg]]

#### KiloavaRandomShout2
Yeaaaaaaaah!
![[Kiloava - KiloavaRandomShout2.ogg]]

#### KiloavaRandomShout3
Who can stand against the storm?
![[Kiloava - KiloavaRandomShout3.ogg]]

#### KiloavaRandomShout4
What time is it? It's Kiloava time!
![[Kiloava - KiloavaRandomShout4.ogg]]

#### Kaom
Kaom can eat a {rumakino} berry for all I care. I don't want to talk about him.
![[Kiloava - Kaom.ogg]]

#### Valako
I have a complex relationship with Valako. I speak to him, and he remains silent. It's just like my last wife! I joke, but... we're alone. The Karui must forge their own path in this world. Valako is more like our tribe mascot than an actual figure of leadership or aid.
![[Kiloava - Valako.ogg]]

#### Souls
Many think I was 'defeated' by Kaom in some grand battle, but I was seventy-four when he took my head. He essentially bullied an old man. Can you picture my delight when I awoke here in my prime? I know that I give you lots of, what do they say? Shite? Yes, but I'm just overcome with joy at being young and strong again. No harm meant. Oh, and I'm one of the lucky ones. Here, our souls appear as we truly see ourselves. Some of us had some pretty big surprises when they woke up in the Halls of the Dead! Ha ha!
![[Kiloava - Souls.ogg]]

#### Herald of War
They call me the first Herald of War, and indeed I was, but they don't understand. Valako gave a Sign to my people thousands of years ago, a ring with his graven pattern. It passed down from chieftain to chieftain in my tribe. When I put it on, it did something it never had before: it surged with the power of the storm. Valako didn't know me. How could he? The gods were asleep. So, I appointed {myself} the Herald of War, and I used the power of Valako's Sign to win many great battles. I laid the foundations for Karui unification before Kaom was even an urge in some bastard's loins.
![[Kiloava - Herald of War.ogg]]

#### Tribes
We all seem neatly divided into our tribes here, but it isn't so. Warriors switch tribes all the time due to marriage, chieftain successions, or simple wanderlust. We Karui are a nomadic people, in the physical and spiritual sense. When I call my tribe the Valako tribe, yes, we are, but at one time we followed Tukohama, and at another Tasalio, and then Valako again before that. Essentially, each god must prove themselves to us the same way we prove ourselves to each other. If a tribe falls on hard times, clearly, their god has failed them, and it may be time for another. We can also call upon any god we wish at any time, so long as we are in good standing as a warrior. Basically, it's like children running amok around the campfire.
![[Kiloava - Tribes.ogg]]

#### Tawhanuku
It's funny, outsider. We think we get to choose who we fight. Tawhanuku already knows ahead of time what we will do, mostly. If you fight her, it's because she's chosen to fight {you}. That doesn't mean she'll win, though. Even Hinekora's vision isn't infallible.
![[Kiloava - Tawhanuku.ogg]]

#### Utula
He's an odd tuatara, that one. Seems to think this incredible place is some sort of prison. I for one relish being in my prime again. Maybe he's just angry he's got those crazy bug eyes.
![[Kiloava - Utula.ogg]]

#### Maata
Ha ha, poor Maata! Because of his true self, he's cursed to be an old man for eternity! Hilarity!
![[Kiloava - Maata.ogg]]

#### Bloodline
Certain arrogant warlords claim my bloodline was ended, but they don't know just how many children I really had... I was something of a madman in my prime! Half the warriors serving under them might be descended from me at this point! Ha ha! Ah... they come to the Halls of the Dead for advice. I tell them to drink, fight, and enjoy life while they have it!
![[Kiloava - Bloodline.ogg]]

#### The End of Time
Have you ever had the feeling, during a rising storm, that the winds and rain might just keep getting stronger and never ebb? That's how the world will end. A great storm will cover the land, and it will just keep raging harder and harder until everything is swept away. Then, as always happens after a big storm, life will burgeon anew. We see it all the time around us. Why would it be any other way?
![[Kiloava - The End of Time.ogg]]

#### Ikiaho
Yes, yes, she has a frozen heart. That's all anyone ever talks about. She's turned {me} down a few times, and I've gone through the traditions with everyone else here, even Rakiata! No disrespect, if it moves, I'll chase it! We're all young again except for poor Maata, ha ha! so why shouldn't we enjoy ourselves?
![[Kiloava - Ikiaho.ogg]]
