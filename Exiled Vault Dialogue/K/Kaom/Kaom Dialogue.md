My warriors have always fought outnumbered. This will be no different.
![[Kaom - KaomFightBeginsPlayerMoreSoldiers1.ogg]]

#### KaomFightBeginsPlayerLessSoldiers1
You seek to take us on with so few warriors? You are a fool!
![[Kaom - KaomFightBeginsPlayerLessSoldiers1.ogg]]

#### KaomFightBeginsPlayerMoreItems1
You are well-equipped. It won't help you.
![[Kaom - KaomFightBeginsPlayerMoreItems1.ogg]]

#### KaomFightBeginsPlayerLessItems1
You should have better prepared for battle.
![[Kaom - KaomFightBeginsPlayerLessItems1.ogg]]

Like you, the Eternals had the terrain advantage. They still died.

My warriors cannot possibly win now...
![[Kaom - KaomTotemDestroyed1.ogg]]

![[Kaom - KaomYourTeamTotemDestroyed5.ogg]]

#### KaomYourTotemDestroyed1
Victory is inevitable now!
![[Kaom - KaomYourTotemDestroyed1.ogg]]

#### KaomYourTotemDestroyed3
You never had a chance.
![[Kaom - KaomYourTotemDestroyed3.ogg]]

The Karui always win.
![[Kaom - KaomYourTotemDestroyed5.ogg]]

The correct choice.
![[Kaom - KaomCommentRecruitRecruit1.ogg]]

#### KaomCommentRecruitRecruit3
They will serve you well.
![[Kaom - KaomCommentRecruitRecruit3.ogg]]

#### KaomCommentRecruitRecruit5
Victory is certain with one of my warriors at your side.
![[Kaom - KaomCommentRecruitRecruit5.ogg]]

#### Kahuturoa's Victory
It is always a pleasure seeing my enemies laid low.
![[Kaom - Kahuturoa's Victory.ogg]]

#### KaomPlayerLostVsKahuturoa
You lost to the cowardly night fighters. How disappointing.
![[Kaom - KaomPlayerLostVsKahuturoa.ogg]]

#### Kiloava's Defeat
Seeing Kiloava humiliated was... satisfying. You fought well.
![[Kaom - Kiloava's Defeat.ogg]]

#### Kiloava's Victory
As much as I dislike Kiloava, your loss to him was not unexpected.
![[Kaom - Kiloava's Victory.ogg]]

#### Maata's Defeat
No surprise that you defeated the peacemaker.
![[Kaom - Maata's Defeat.ogg]]

#### Maata's Victory
How did you manage to lose to the peacemaker?
![[Kaom - Maata's Victory.ogg]]

#### Rakiata's Defeat
You should have cut off Rakiata's head. I did.
![[Kaom - Rakiata's Defeat.ogg]]

#### Rakiata's Victory
Train hard, and take on Rakiata again.
![[Kaom - Rakiata's Victory.ogg]]

#### Ahuana's Defeat
Ahuana goes too easy on newcomers. Don't think you won for any other reason.
![[Kaom - Ahuana's Defeat.ogg]]

#### Ahuana's Victory
Only the greatest of warriors can take on Ahuana. Don't be ashamed of your loss.
![[Kaom - Ahuana's Victory.ogg]]

#### Akoya's Defeat
Akoya upholds our Way, even in defeat. It was an honourable battle.
![[Kaom - Akoya's Defeat.ogg]]

#### Akoya's Victory
I enjoyed watching Akoya take you down. She's a very talented warrior.
![[Kaom - Akoya's Victory.ogg]]

#### Ikiaho's Defeat
That was rather impressive. I didn't expect you to defeat Ikiaho.
![[Kaom - Ikiaho's Defeat.ogg]]

#### Ikiaho's Victory
No one thaws Ikiaho. Do not be disheartened.
![[Kaom - Ikiaho's Victory.ogg]]

#### Tawhanuku's Defeat
That was a gripping battle against Tawhanuku. I'm certain she saw it coming.
![[Kaom - Tawhanuku's Defeat.ogg]]

#### Tawhanuku's Victory
Tawhunuku serves Hinekora, and Hinekora sees all. She took that battle knowing she would win.
![[Kaom - Tawhanuku's Victory.ogg]]

#### Utula's Defeat
Alright, I'm impressed. Defeating Utula was no small success.
![[Kaom - Utula's Defeat.ogg]]

#### Utula's Victory
Utula is a true Karui warrior. He will win time and time again!
![[Kaom - Utula's Victory.ogg]]

#### Kaom's Defeat
You seemed like you needed a win, so I let you have one. It's as simple as that.
![[Kaom - Kaom's Defeat.ogg]]

#### Kaom's Victory
Do not be disheartened, outsider. You never had a chance against me. There was nothing you could have done.
![[Kaom - Kaom's Victory.ogg]]

#### Match Victory
Your victory was interesting to watch, at the very least.
![[Kaom - Match Victory.ogg]]

#### Match Loss
You held yourself well against the Karui's greatest warriors. That is all you can really hope for, outsider.
![[Kaom - Match Loss.ogg]]

#### KaomCommentOnPurchaseItemMaata
Peacemaker, your deals will only aid your enemy!
![[Kaom - KaomCommentOnPurchaseItemMaata.ogg]]

#### KaomCommentOnPurchaseEliteAhuana
How original!
![[Kaom - KaomCommentOnPurchaseEliteAhuana.ogg]]

#### KaomCommentOnPurchaseEliteAkoya
The traditional Way leads to victory!
![[Kaom - KaomCommentOnPurchaseEliteAkoya.ogg]]

#### KaomCommentOnPurchaseEliteKiloava
My warriors would have been a better choice!
![[Kaom - KaomCommentOnPurchaseEliteKiloava.ogg]]

#### KaomRandomShout1
The outsider walks among us!
![[Kaom - KaomRandomShout1.ogg]]

#### KaomRandomShout2
Today is a good day for battle.
![[Kaom - KaomRandomShout2.ogg]]

#### The Nightmare
My dream, my Nightmare, seemed without end. I couldn't think, couldn't hope, couldn't fight to escape. There was only madness and pain. I believed I had built a home and an empire for my people, but in truth, it was all a lie. You shattered my nightmare and slew Malachai, and for that, I have made no argument against your presence in this sacred place. Consider us even. I owe you nothing.
![[Kaom - The Nightmare.ogg]]

#### Tukohama's Defeat
{You} defeated Tukohama in battle? No, you defeated a shadow of the Father of War. He was weakened by his long sleep, or by the pervasive Corruption of Wraeclast. You struck when he was feeble and confused. Keep your ego small. Hmm... perhaps {I} could be the next Father of War... if such a thing is possible....
![[Kaom - Tukohama's Defeat.ogg]]

#### Kitava's Defeat
I did hear that you 'defeated' Kitava. You should be aware that he was nothing more than a hungry blind child, propped up and fed by Utula's tribe. How exactly did you fear he would consume the whole world when he could hardly move from his cathedral cradle? Your great victory, 'Godslayer,' is nothing to brag about. We have not needed our gods to be personally present for thousands of years, and we will not be diminished by their loss. We have our own strength.
![[Kaom - Kitava's Defeat.ogg]]

#### Invasion of Wraeclast
Uniting the tribes was a worthy endeavour. Invading the mainland, however, was a fool's errand. Wraeclast has only ever been an accursed place that no true Karui should ever step foot on. I wish I had known how tainted it truly was. I would have set fire to it rather than try to claim it. Every empire that has ever arisen there eventually collapsed under the weight of its own disease.
![[Kaom - Invasion of Wraeclast.ogg]]

#### Hyrri
Hyrri is not here... I hoped to greet her in the afterlife, but her soul has not found its way to the Halls of the Dead. My tribe's {hatungo}, Lavianga, believed that Hyrri damned herself by breaking the {tavukai}, but that is not a rule the Ramako Tribe follows. I was certain there would be no dishonour in the eyes of the gods, yet Navali remains cryptic on her absence. She should be here. I am... incensed.
![[Kaom - Hyrri.ogg]]

#### Hyrri's Soul
So, you have found Hyrri's soul! Our {hatungo} knows nothing of this Domain of Timeless Conflict, but it seems that we have a new realm to make war upon. We will find it and rescue Hyrri and her army, no matter the cost. Not a single Karui soul will be left behind. This is the promise I make to our Ancestors! We will have our vengeance!
![[Kaom - Hyrri's Soul.ogg]]

#### The Karui Way
I have already proven that the Karui Way is the one true path. I united the otherwise squabbling tribes into one mighty horde, the greatest the world has ever known, and I did that with the sheer force of my axe. There are chieftains among us here that experienced that firsthand. They know not to challenge me. You should know that as well.
![[Kaom - The Karui Way.ogg]]

#### Wraeclast
Let Wraeclast fester in darkness. It is a diseased land not fit for life. My advice to future generations of Karui shall always be so: keep to the islands and their abundance. Let the ruins of the Eternal and the Vaal Empires rot like the corpses they are. If Wraeclast needs anything, it is fire, to burn away that which can never be pure again.
![[Kaom - Wraeclast.ogg]]

#### The Halls of the Dead
Even before I ventured to the Isle of the Shrikes, I knew I would earn my place here. Now, I will prove my might in each new Trial. I will never be deposed. This honour is mine forever... or until Time ends, as Navali claims it will one day. How absurd.
![[Kaom - The Halls of the Dead.ogg]]

#### The End of Time
The Hinekora Tribe thinks Time will simply stop one day. No. The Ngamahu Tribe believes the world will end, not with some pathetic unraveling of the seasons, but with a tremendous eruption. Wraeclast will stab itself and pour forth its lifeblood to burn away all life, both the mighty and the diseased, as it has done before. Then, the first of a new line of Karui will emerge from the molten caldera, as we did before. They will be different. Maybe better, in some sense, having learned from the wisdom our souls will carry forward. Theirs will be a savage new world to conquer all over again. I wish I could be there to see it... a glorious new challenge unlike any other... but my soul will be returned to the volcano with all the others here in the Halls of the Dead, to be melted and reforged into that entirely new Karui essence, that new line. I could wish for no better end.
![[Kaom - The End of Time.ogg]]

#### Hinekora
Hinekora shall always be honoured as the Mother of Death and the creator of this place, but she rarely speaks. I believe she is lost in her visions. It is unclear how much Navali communicates with her, and how much the {hatungo} is saying on her own...
![[Kaom - Hinekora.ogg]]

#### Ngamahu
For countless generations, a small number of my tribe secretly watched over Ngamahu as she slept. She must have awoken by now, but I have heard nothing of her whereabouts or intent. It is frustrating having to remain here in the Halls of the Dead while the Mother of Fire walks the world in the flesh. I would very much like to meet her. Before I was of age, my father's father allowed me to look upon her sleeping face. It was only then that I understood that there are types of fire unknown to a mere boy.
![[Kaom - Ngamahu.ogg]]

#### Respect
You are a true son of the Karui. You honour the Way with your strength. Though I may challenge you in the Trials, you have my respect.
![[Kaom - Respect.ogg]]

#### KaomConversationWithUtulaOne
Utula! You are most welcome here. Tell me, how did you die?
![[Kaom - KaomConversationWithUtulaOne.ogg]]

#### KaomConversationWithUtulaTwo
I should have guessed. How... irritating.
![[Kaom - KaomConversationWithUtulaTwo.ogg]]

#### KaomConversationWithKiloavaOne
Insult me all you want, but not like that. Never like that.
![[Kaom - KaomConversationWithKiloavaOne.ogg]]
