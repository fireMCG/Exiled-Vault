## Kraytin Dialogue
#### KraitynOnDarkness
The world gets all bent out of shape, and suddenly here you are. Doesn't take a genius to add that one up. I'm the kind that cleans up his own messes. What kind are you?

#### KraitynOnLight
Never thought I'd be so happy to see that old sun baring its shiny ass at me. I think I'll take credit for this one. Tell the boys it was {my} doing. It'd be good for them to have a strong role model. I'm sure you understand.

#### Hand in Amulets
Ah, sweeter than mother's milk. Might as well take this pretty husk with you. Something to remember me by. Nice working with you, matey. I wish you luck on your travels but, from what I seen, you won't be needing it.

#### Kraityn's Rivals
No pain, no gain, I once heard someone say. Make sure it's Oak and Alira's pain now, won't you. And lots of it.

#### Kraityn's Rivals_2
Like I figured, first time I saw you: you're trouble. And trouble don't play nice with others. Guess what? I'm a bit troubled myself.

#### Kraityn's Rivals_3
You know, you could always stick around and be part of our cozy little commune. It's about to get a damn sight bigger, thanks to you... No? I'd be making tracks then. I don't mind you hanging about, but this lot... They're not as {tolerant} as I am. I'm afraid, my friend, I simply can't vouch for your safety.

#### Kraityn's Rivals_4
You're trouble. I like that. Know what I don't like? Oak and Alira, and their thieving mongrels. They keep taking what's mine. I'm thinking you could do something about that. What's in it for you? The amulets around Oak's and Alira's necks. The ones like mine here. There's power in them beyond reckoning. Take two heads and two amulets, bring them to me, and take half the power. That add up right for you?
![[Kraytin - Kraityn's Rivals_4.ogg]]

#### Kraityn's Rivals_5
Heard you toppled a big tree. Handy work, that. And if you can chop down an Oak, you can pull out a weed. The weed's got a name: Alira, and I'm sick of seeing her in my garden. What's in it for you? The amulets around Oak's and Alira's necks. The ones like mine here. There's power in them beyond reckoning. I'm thinking you got one already from old lumber-for-brains. Make it two, bring them to me, and take half the power for yourself. That add up right for you?
![[Kraytin - Kraityn's Rivals_5.ogg]]

#### Kraityn's Rivals_6
Heard you pulled a weed out of my garden: the Alira thistle. Handy work, that. Now there's a tree needs chopping down, too. An Oak. He's blocking my sun. What's in it for you? The amulets around Oak's and Alira's necks. The ones like mine here. There's power in them beyond reckoning. I'm thinking you got one already from the whore. Make it two, bring them to me, and take half the power for yourself. That add up right for you?
![[Kraytin - Kraityn's Rivals_6.ogg]]

#### Kraityn's Rivals_7
Heard you been doing some serious gardenin' around the place. Felled a big, dumb Oak, and plucked an Alira thistle from a foul bed. And I'm thinking you got a couple of amulets in your pockets. Ones like mine here. There's power in them, you know. But only when all three get to dance together. I'm not greedy, mind. I'm willing to split that power with you, right down the middle. Hand me those amulets, and let's see what fate has in store for us.

#### Kraityn's Rivals_8
So you're Oak's lackey, are you? I could be wasting the last of my breath here, but you're barking up the wrong tree. Once he's done with you, your brains will be splattered all over the nearest trunk. Here's the truth of it. Oak and Alira, they care for nothing and no one. Me? I care about a thing called arithmetic. You take two heads and two amulets, bring them to me, and you get half the power. That add up right for you?
![[Kraytin - Kraityn's Rivals_8.ogg]]

#### Kraityn's Rivals_9
Heard you pulled a weed out of my garden: the Alira thistle. Handy work, that. But you're Oak's lackey, are you? I could be wasting the last of my breath here but... you're barking up the wrong tree. Once he's done with you, your brains will be splattered all over the nearest trunk. Me? I care about a thing called arithmetic. You go take one head, bring me two amulets, and I'll give you half the power. That add up right to you?
![[Kraytin - Kraityn's Rivals_9.ogg]]

#### Kraityn's Rivals_10
So you're Alira's lap dog, are you? I could be wasting the last of my breath here, but you're chasing the wrong tail. Once Alira's done with you, those brave guts of yours will be steaming on the ground. Here's the truth of it. Oak and Alira, they care for nothing and no one. Me? I care about a thing called arithmetic. You go take two heads and two amulets, bring them to me, and you get half the power. That add up right to you?
![[Kraytin - Kraityn's Rivals_10.ogg]]

#### Kraityn's Rivals_11
Heard you felled a big tree. Handy work, that. But you're Alira's lap dog, are you? I could be wasting the last of my breath here... you're chasing the wrong tail. Once Alira's done with you, those brave guts of yours will be steaming on the ground. Here's the truth of it: Alira cares for nothing and no one. Me? I care about a thing called arithmetic. You go take one head, bring me two amulets, and I'll give you half the power. That add up right to you?
![[Kraytin - Kraityn's Rivals_11.ogg]]

#### Kraityn's Rivals_12
Heard you felled a big tree, and got yourself one of the amulets. Handy work, that. But you don't seem the kind to leave a job half done. If you can chop down an Oak, you can pull out a weed. The weed's got a name: Alira, and I'm sick of seeing her in my garden.
![[Kraytin - Kraityn's Rivals_12.ogg]]

#### Kraityn's Rivals_13
Heard you pulled a weed out of my garden, and got yourself one of the amulets. Handy work, that. But you don't seem the kind to leave a job half done. Remember, there's a tree needs chopping down. Goes by the name of Oak. He's blocking my sun.
![[Kraytin - Kraityn's Rivals_13.ogg]]

#### Kraityn's Rivals_14
My gardens all tidy, just like that. I knew you were just the kind of trouble I needed. Now, hand me those amulets, and let's see what fate has in store for us.
![[Kraytin - Kraityn's Rivals_14.ogg]]

#### Kraityn's Rivals_15
Don't think we've got anything more to talk about, do we? Bring me a head or two. That's always a good conversation starter.
