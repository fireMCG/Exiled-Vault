## Silk Dialogue
#### Introduction
You and me... we are the same. We dream big. We find new places. We do not tell stories. Stories are told about us! I learn the words, the ways of Oriath. You listen to me and not pig heads like Greust. Then you will live to find more new places.
![[Silk - Introduction.ogg]]

#### Eramir
Many exiles come this way. Eramir is not like them. Not like you. He is an old man with many stories. He teaches us words that you can understand. He teaches we Azmeri to be strong, not in our arms and legs like Greust. Strong in our heads.
![[Silk - Eramir.ogg]]

#### Yeena
I like Yeena. She thinks bigger than this place. She knows there is more to life than hunting and growing morcha. There is Spirit.
![[Silk - Yeena.ogg]]

#### Greust
Greust is the big man in the tribe. All do what Greust says... but his spear goes limp when faced with the Eight-Legs.
![[Silk - Greust.ogg]]

#### Helena
I like this new Oriathan woman. She has new stories, not like Eramir who only speak of that which is dead and dust. Yes, I have many questions for this Helena.

#### Maligaro's Spike
I have story for you. A good story... but not finished. I go into eight-leg forest in south-west... meet the mother of all eight-legs. We fight, big fight, from sunrise to sunset. I stick my best spear in mother's eye and return to village. Must not stay away too long. Must protect my people. Now my best spear still in mother's eye! Eramir said to leave it there, that my spear is a thing made for 'dark science', whatever that be. No, I want it back, but Mother Eight-leg would smell me from far off. Catch me by surprise. She doesn't know your smell, so you go. Get my spear. Finish good story with good ending.

#### Maligaro's Spike_2
That spear... yes, that is my best spear, the one I stuck in eye of old Mother Eight-leg. I think you keep it now. Let the beasts and bandits fear you even more. It is my gift to you. From one hero to another. Wait... no, you need more than just spear and happy words for this great deed. You kill mother of all eight legs! You need prize. Here, when I found my spear in the forest, I found these too. You will take, yes?

#### The Darkness
What has happened? Did the world not rise from its sleep? How do we wake it up? Please... what should we do?!
![[Silk - The Darkness.ogg]]

#### The Great White Beast
Her fur, her skin, it remind me of biting winter. I see her one night, follow her to a cave in the Old Fields, to the east. Listened to her howl at the stars. A sad, sad sound. Great white beast, she full of old pain.
![[Silk - The Great White Beast.ogg]]

#### The Great White Beast_2
Great White beast is dead? Then make a tale, a song to sing, of the mighty exile and their teacher, Silk the Wise. Many will be impressed, yes?
![[Silk - The Great White Beast_2.ogg]]

#### Blocked Passage
The road? It runs east and west of here. To the west it passes the bandit woman's camp, then turns south, to the sea. But you say it is now blocked? I have seen a strange thing in the rock by the south pass. Like one of Greust's carvings, but of stone. You should go look at it. What has been closed might be opened again.
![[Silk - Blocked Passage.ogg]]

#### Reopened Passage
The pass to the sea is open? You are a legend that lives, exile!
![[Silk - Reopened Passage.ogg]]

#### The Light
I knew this strangeness would pass. Silk does not run from such things. I stand, I guard when others shiver and shake.
![[Silk - The Light.ogg]]

#### SilkIntro
Hello to you, Great Dreamer!
![[Silk - SilkIntro.ogg]]

#### Black Venom
We have woven a tale together in days past. Perhaps we shall again? We make mighty stories, you and I, and now I have daunting task before me... the last in my great journey. Near to us, cast in shadow, a monster awaits. Black Death is his name, a beauteous eight-leg, twisted grotesque by the master of these loathsome halls. I wish to give this eight-leg the merciful peace he deserves, and to save what is still beautiful, the elixir that only Black Death can make. Please, will you find him, kill this Black Death, take the eight-leg's venom for me? I may be fearsome warrior but Black Death's master has made him into a thing more monstrous than even I can best. Who knows? Perhaps Black Death is too strong even for you?
![[Silk - Black Venom.ogg]]

#### Black Venom_2
The Black Venom! Oh, Great Dreamer who has done great deeds, I shall see to it that my queen rewards you with honour and mercy when she rises up to claim what is hers. Yes, this elixir, so aged and potent, shall be life-giving draught that she sips upon first waking. It is my gift to her... my wedding gift! Great Dreamer, you be wrapped in silken finery and made welcome at our wedding feast. Guest of honour, and oh what a feast we all shall enjoy!
![[Silk - Black Venom_2.ogg]]

#### Black Death
I have climbed the great eight-leg web. I know the eight-legs like no other. This eight-leg, this Black Death, is one of the oldest and most fearsome eight-legs in all this land and beyond. To its shame, it was made pet, plaything, by the malicious master of this place. For years countless it grew in pain. Pain is all it knows, all it can understand, all it can give. End Black Death's pain, for all and once.
![[Silk - Black Death.ogg]]

#### Silk's Journey
My great journey led me to places of great power beyond even your stories, Great Dreamer. I am carried on legs and webs and shadows. That is all you can know for now.
![[Silk - Silk's Journey.ogg]]

#### SilkPreBoss
My bride has arrived, exile! I hope you brought a wedding gift!
