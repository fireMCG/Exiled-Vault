## Shadow - PoE1 Dialogue
#### Shadow1
Theopolis Prison's a child's playhouse compared to this. They sure don't make them like they used to.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow1.ogg]]

#### Shadow2
I'm usually the one making the ghosts. Someone's been busy.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow2.ogg]]

#### Shadow3
I've seen some dark places in my line of work, but this is something else.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow3.ogg]]

#### Shadow4
Treat life and death with equal grace, it said. If I were Death, I'd take offense at this place.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow4.ogg]]

#### Shadow5
Not a speck of dust or brick out of place. Someone's got too much time on their hands.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow5.ogg]]

#### Shadow6
Downed a bad vial of Lethe milk once. It felt just like this place.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow6.ogg]]

#### Shadow7
"Big" just means "more places to stick a blade".
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow7.ogg]]

#### Shadow8
I almost feel sorry for you, Fairgraves. Dying twice... can't be fun.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow8.ogg]]

#### Shadow9
My first dance with a lady of quality. Pity she let herself go like that.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow9.ogg]]

#### Shadow10
Now that's what you get for bringing a stick to a knife-fight.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow10.ogg]]

#### Shadow11
All that flashy sword swinging, when all you need is one good stab.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow11.ogg]]

#### Shadow12
Did the earth move for you, baby? Probably. You hit the ground quite hard.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow12.ogg]]

#### Shadow13
I like darkness as much as the next assassin, but that was overdoing it.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow13.ogg]]

#### Shadow14
Had I killed you back in Oriath, I'd have been showered in gold. Where's the justice, eh?
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow14.ogg]]

#### Shadow15
I try not to take my work personally, but you, Piety, were a satisfying exception.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow15.ogg]]

#### Shadow16
It's funny, your grace. I always thought you'd be taller.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow16.ogg]]

#### Shadow17
Ah, nothing like a brisk dip to start the day. Now, where on God's arse am I?
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow17.ogg]]

#### Shadow18
This Shadow is starting to feel a little inadequate.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow18.ogg]]

#### Shadow19
Low on mana!
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow19.ogg]]

#### Shadow20
I need more pockets.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow20.ogg]]

#### Shadow21
That feels better!
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow21.ogg]]

#### Shadow22
I'm not strong enough for that.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow22.ogg]]

#### Shadow23
I'm not smart enough for that. Yet.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow23.ogg]]

#### Shadow24
A bit too fiddly, even for me.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow24.ogg]]

#### Shadow25
I should save that for later.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow25.ogg]]

#### Shadow26
I don't think I need to be doing that right now.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow26.ogg]]

#### Shadow27
It's nice not being dead yet.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow27.ogg]]

#### Shadow28
I'm impressed by how much this place wants me dead.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow28.ogg]]

#### Shadow29
With every death, I live a little bit more.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow29.ogg]]

#### Shadow30
I'm so good at this, I scare myself.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow30.ogg]]

#### Shadow31
I'm a gardener, clearing the weeds so that the crops may grow.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow31.ogg]]

#### Shadow32
No point in looking back now, there's just death... and a lot of it.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow32.ogg]]

#### Shadow33
I'd question what I've become, if I felt the need. I don't.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow33.ogg]]

#### Shadow34
Poor Fairgraves. Your plans just don't end well, do they.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow34.ogg]]

#### Shadow35
Now there's a contract I'll most happily fulfill, Piety.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow35.ogg]]

#### Shadow36
All this water and not a single working boat in sight. More walking and killing for me then.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow36.ogg]]

#### Shadow37
An amazing creature, this Beast. Almost a shame to kill it.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow37.ogg]]

#### Shadow38
I'm inside the Blackguard stronghold... like a fox in a henhouse.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow38.ogg]]

#### Shadow39
The furnace down at the slaughterhouse... yes, that's what this place smells like.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow39.ogg]]

#### Shadow40
Forest. Death has too many damned places to hide in a forest.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow40.ogg]]

#### Shadow41
I'm working with Piety. That sounds even stranger when I say it out loud.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow41.ogg]]

#### Shadow42
I was once off my tits for three days after taking bad lethe-drops. Felt just like this place.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow42.ogg]]

#### Shadow43
Swallowed by the darkness, and I seem to be causing it a little indigestion.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow43.ogg]]

#### Shadow44
Someone or something is keeping very busy in the bowels of this mountain.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow44.ogg]]

#### Shadow45
I do hope these constipated bowels don't find their release while I'm still inside them.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow45.ogg]]

#### Shadow46
Ah! It's so good to be back in the city.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow46.ogg]]

#### Shadow47
Whoever built this was desperately compensating for something.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow47.ogg]]

#### Shadow48
It's always comforting to witness an honest, permanent death.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow48.ogg]]

#### Shadow49
Oh, can you sing one for me too, Merveil? Something upbeat, please.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow49.ogg]]

#### Shadow50
Oh, do stop mumbling.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow50.ogg]]

#### Shadow51
Is it possible to murder someone who's already dead?
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow51.ogg]]

#### Shadow52
And that's where you missed the point, Malachai. Death is the only thing that gives life any meaning.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow52.ogg]]

#### Shadow53
I don't know much about Art, but I know what I like.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow53.ogg]]

#### Shadow54
For someone so obsessed with looks, that wasn't a pretty death.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow54.ogg]]

#### Shadow55
I just killed an emperor. With a feather that size, I'm going to have to get a bigger cap.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow55.ogg]]

#### Shadow56
Just need a moment to catch my breath.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow56.ogg]]

#### Shadow59
Now that was satisfying!
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow59.ogg]]

#### Shadow61
Not all murders are equal!
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow61.ogg]]

#### Shadow63
That was fun!
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow63.ogg]]

#### Shadow65
Play dead. Good doggy!
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow65.ogg]]

#### Shadow66
Look on death as a holiday, Kaom. A chance to relax, put your feet up.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow66.ogg]]

#### Shadow67
Dry as a joke in a mortuary.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow67.ogg]]

#### Shadow68
What a disturbingly angry place.
![[Shadow - PoE1 - Shadow68.ogg]]

#### Dom_Intro_Shadow.ogg
You were born with quickness of body and sharpness of mind. How have you paid for these gifts? With innocent blood. Yours is a predatory profession. The business of butchery. You have stolen many a life to fill your purse. Now you will earn your redemption in Wraeclast.
