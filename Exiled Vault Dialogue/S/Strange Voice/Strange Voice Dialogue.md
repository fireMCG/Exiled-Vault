#### DeliriumVoiceArea1-
Farewell Innocence, and hello, my agent of anarchy. It appears I've returned just in time for the party...
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea1-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea2-
I know you can hear me, exile. You're not mad... not yet...
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea2-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea3-
What magnificent monuments to mortal absurdity. Yet it is somehow... aspirational.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea3-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea4-
If only you knew what this place truly hides...
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea4-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea5-
Flames and madness. I'm so glad I didn't miss the fun.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea5-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea6-
One person's beginning is another's end. I wonder what your end will begin...
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea6-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea7-
Death still crashes upon the sands. But who are these new inhabitants?
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea7-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea8-
Feel compelled to stride beneath the waves? Perhaps you should.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea8-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea9-
The God of War has reshaped this region. He's always been... unimaginative.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea9-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea10-
Tukohama is expecting you... Don't keep him waiting.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea10-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea11-
New paths lead to new nightmares.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea11-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea12-
Are you any more free than the bones trapped down here? Or are you caught in a prison of a different kind?
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea12-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea13-
Climb to great heights, only to leap... You feel the temptation, do you not?

The Soul Drinker... Abberath awaits...
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea14-.ogg]]

The Puppet Mistress is calling your name...
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea15-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea16-
Can you hear it, Exile? Madness approaches.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea16-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea17-
Life would be so much simpler if you accepted Ryslatha's offer...
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea17-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea18-
Salt on the wind... The river sours. The King has returned.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea18-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea19-
Are you being led into a trap?
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea19-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea20-
He calls to you from beyond the horizon...
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea20-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea21-
The Lord of Salt and Sea shall set you free... Well, your soul anyway.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea21-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea22-
All these rotten rattlers were brought down by your hand. Will they return the favour?
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea22-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea23-
It was madness which strangled this place. You can feel it, can't you?
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea23-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea24-
Look what faith does. Ignore not this lesson.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea24-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea25-
Noplace better to hide your heresy than right beneath the bishop's nose...
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea25-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea26-
Skill bound by logic built this grim sanctuary. Madness tore it down.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea26-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea27-
Such magnificent talent. And you wish to ruin it...
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea27-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea28-
Deeper still, Exile. Deeper still.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea28-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea29-
The walls are closing in...
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea29-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea30-
Ralakesh... My brother has been busy, hasn't he...
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea30-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea31-
Can you feel it? Despair, thick as cloth.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea31-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea32-
Gruthkul got a lot less fun after, you know, all her children died. Not my fault.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea32-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea33-
Great works require a touch of insanity.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea33-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea34-
An entire civilization caught in a blood-hungry frenzy. What a delight it was to witness.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea34-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea35-
The Mother of Shadows makes herself known.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea35-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea36-
Nice of you to help rid Sin of his former lover. I'd have told him exactly where he could put such a request.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea36-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea37-
What were such large walls trying to keep out? Or... keep in...?
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea37-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea38-
Take a deep breath, Exile. That is the smell of civilised society.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea38-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea39-
Why do mortals insist on burying all the fun things?
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea39-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea40-
My greatest regret is not being there to witness the bedlam that led to the state of this city.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea40-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea41-
Run through your tunnels, ugly little rat! Pick up your scraps! Beware of the cat!
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea41-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea42-
This looks like a lovely spot to lay down and die, Exile.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea42-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea43-
Oh, this brings back memories. Solaris was not so gaudy when I knew her.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea43-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea44-
They used to be so close, you know... The Celestial Sisters.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea44-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea45-
Such grand monuments built to honour a petty hot-head.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea45-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea46-
Parade your victories, hide your defeats. Mortals are so insecure.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea46-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea47-
That little creep is near. How exciting.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea47-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea48-
Yugul, the silver terror. Now we shall see what you're made of, Exile.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea48-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea49-
I'd not have wasted so much stone on these sisters.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea49-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea50-
Lunaris was always the moody one.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea50-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea51-
It wasn't hard to turn them against each other. A little nudge here and there. That's all it took.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea51-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea52-
You wish to fight the very skies themselves. Win or lose, this will be a pleasure to see.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea52-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea53-
Take a sip. What's the worst that could happen?
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea53-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea54-
You're quite the slaughterer. Should I be wary of you?
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea54-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea55-
Savour the sand that stings your face. It is a reminder that I still let you live.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea55-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea56-
You cannot slay gods. Gods are immortal. Do you question what you are told?
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea56-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea57-
Sin is sending you to slay his daughter now, too? You'd think he would be more upset...
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea57-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea58-
Why do you believe Sin can be trusted?
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea58-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea59-
It was Sin's creation that brought about Wraeclast's ruin. We are simply here to restore it.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea59-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea60-
Garukhan nests near. What I wouldn't give to relive the halcyon days of ancient Keth, when we kept mortals in their rightful place.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea60-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea61-
Technology is a poor substitute for power.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea61-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea62-
I will not miss this thing's strangling slumber.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea62-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea63-
The smell is bad, but the tenants are worse...
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea63-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea64-
Once more into the bleeding heart of fury and depravity.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea64-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea65-
You seek to end the madness, yet you were its herald. It was you who allowed Kitava's return.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea65-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea66-
Faith is born in the strangest of places.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea66-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea67-
Such fine trinkets show their true value in times of crisis.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea67-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea68-
Order is ephemeral. Chaos is the natural state of things.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea68-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea69-
Nothing shatters sanity quite like blind faith.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea69-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea70-
How deep do the dead dwell? How many will stand atop your own bones?
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea70-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea71-
Kitava will welcome you with open jaws.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea71-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceArea72-
You walk through the corridors of madness and into the mouth of death itself. I do believe you have finally lost your mind.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceArea72-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandomRandom
Your tolerance of the intolerable is admirable.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandomRandom.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom2
What will be the straw that finally breaks you? I will find it.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom2.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom3
I will never stop searching for that which sends you spiralling into the abyss.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom3.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom4
You cannot stop death.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom4.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom5
Your life will end, and you will be forgotten.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom5.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom6
This is all in your head.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom6.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom7
This is all an illusion.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom7.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom8
Nothing you do will be remembered.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom8.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom9
They {are} out to get you.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom9.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom10
They are plotting against you.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom10.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom11
You are the only one who matters.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom11.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom12
You are greater than a god. Untouchable.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom12.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom13
You have already done this before. You are caught in a loop.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom13.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom14
Your life will leave no trace.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom14.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom15
You will die alone and afraid.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom15.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom16
Everything you have done has only made things worse.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom16.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom17
You will be remembered as a traitor and a tyrant.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom17.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom18
You are the cause of great misery.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom18.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom19
You have fabricated your entire memory.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom19.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom20
You are being controlled by greater forces.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom20.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom21
Nothing you have done was real.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom21.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom22
Your life has been one long lie.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom22.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom23
They are using you. Everyone is simply using you.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom23.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom24
You will never get that which you seek.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom24.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom25
They are getting closer. They will find you and they will destroy you.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom25.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom26
They know all your secrets. Nothing is hidden from their view.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom26.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom27
You have experienced no real pain. That will soon change.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom27.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom28
All suffering in this world stems from your actions.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom28.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom29
Feeling OK...? You're looking a little pale, Exile...
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom29.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom30
Ohh, the weary traveler draws close to the end of its life!
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom30.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom31
Still alive, exile? For now...
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom31.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom32
You are rotting from the inside out.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom32.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom33
Everyone you trust has been replaced by illusions. They are trying to get you.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom33.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom34
My lord, you are murdering innocent souls!
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom34.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom35
Time is a veil. You exist in the singular eternity.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom35.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom36
You can never die. Why don't you test it...?
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom36.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom37
The face that stares back in the mirror is a stranger.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom37.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom38
Why don't you lay down your weapons and talk it over...?
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom38.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom39
You are destined to bring ruin to all you touch.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom39.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom40
They will all abandon you when they learn the truth.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom40.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom41
You will be captured, stupid beast.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom41.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom42
You are just another stumbling corpse.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom42.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom43
You are lost in the middle of the jungle.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom43.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom44
The unrighteous will be turned to ash.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom44.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom45
Still sane, exile?
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom45.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom46
They are watching you from beyond this world. Can you feel them?
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom46.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom47
They will turn you into red milk.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom47.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom48
No one knows your name. No one but me.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom48.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom49
You will never know my name.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom49.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom50
You are free to explore this vast world, yet here you are doing the bidding of others.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom50.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom51
Warriors far greater than you ever will be are long forgotten.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom51.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom52
You can't leave this dream.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom52.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom53
You will never escape this nightmare.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom53.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom54
This is your eternity.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom54.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom55
True strength comes from within, and I know for a fact you are empty.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom55.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom56
Everyone you have slain had a life, had a family. Your turn will come one day.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom56.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom57
You destroy that which you cannot control.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom57.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom58
Are you the hunter or are you the prey?
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom58.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom59
Stupid dog, you are chasing your own tail.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom59.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom60
They've come to you to die. You are their mercy.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom60.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceRandom61
Are you the fisherman or are you the bait?
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceRandom61.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceBoss1-
Can't keep still...? Neither can he...
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceBoss1-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceBoss2-
Do you hear it? Your misery manifest now seeks you out.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceBoss2-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceBoss3-
Panic builds within you. You can feel it hunting you, can't you?
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceBoss3-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceBoss4-
Your eyes do not deceive you. That demon has come for your head.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceBoss4-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceBoss5-
I wonder... what horrid visions will this being bring?
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceBoss5-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceBoss6-
Not dead yet? You'll soon wish you were...
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceBoss6-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceBoss7-
Have you met my friend? He is so eager to meet you...
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceBoss7-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceBoss8-
It seems we have a visitor. Why don't you welcome them?
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceBoss8-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceSimulacrum1-
Remember this ramshackle place? A second home... And yet, something seems off, does it not?
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceSimulacrum1-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceSimulacrum2-
You've stood against so many horrors and survived. I think it is time to at last test your limits.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceSimulacrum2-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceSimulacrum3-
This is only the beginning.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceSimulacrum3-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceSimulacrum4-
Let yourself be drawn into the mire!
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceSimulacrum4-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceSimulacrum5-
Are you trying to cleanse yourself of me?
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceSimulacrum5-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceSimulacrum6-
You can't get rid of me, Exile. I am you.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceSimulacrum6-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceSimulacrum7-
Nothing you do matters. The dream will end, and the dreamer will pass into the next world.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceSimulacrum7-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceSimulacrum8-
Do you not wonder what tugs at the strings of fate? What stands astride the abyss and beckons you to fall?
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceSimulacrum8-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceSimulacrum9-
Believe me, you will fall, Exile.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceSimulacrum9-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceSimulacrum10-
I will break you.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceSimulacrum10-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceSimulacrum11-
I will not be made the fool!
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceSimulacrum11-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceSimulacrum12-
So be it. Keep your precious sanity, my agent of chaos. You shall serve me, whether you like it or not. I'm not going anywhere...
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceSimulacrum12-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceQuestState1-
Pleased with yourself? Feel all high and mighty, o powerful 'Godslayer?'
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceQuestState1-.ogg]]

#### DeliriumVoiceQuestState2-
With all the gods dead, I suppose I should turn my full attention to you. We shall see how far you can be pushed.
![[Strange Voice - DeliriumVoiceQuestState2-.ogg]]
