## Sonja, the Farmer Dialogue
#### SonjaIntro
So this is Wraeclast, eh? Strangely warm and humid here, at least compared to back home. Might be better for growin', but we'll see about that. Name's Sonja, and I'm here to help manage the farming.
![[Sonja, the Farmer - SonjaIntro.ogg]]

#### Introduction
This soil. It should be barren. It's sandy. It's clay. All my experience farming tells me this spot should be lifeless. And yet... the plants, they grow. They even thrive. We should till, and sow. I am very intrigued to discover the secrets of this land. You, native, can call me Sonja. If you'll invest in the proper tools, I'll be farming here, and if anyone else wants to help, well, that's on them.

#### SonjaInvestFarming
We all need to eat. With the proper tools, I can get to work right away. I don't really see any other choice here.
![[Sonja, the Farmer - SonjaInvestFarming.ogg]]

#### Sonja
That is my name here, because I have chosen it. I choose to leave behind that which I was, for it was assigned to me. Forced, not given. Family names are the ties that bind.
![[Sonja, the Farmer - Sonja.ogg]]

#### The Soil
I have come to learn more about the land's bounty. Far beneath the sand and clay, there is a hidden layer of volcanic soils, and a thick band of ash. These are rich and fertile deposits. Given our distance from the mountains on Tujen's map, I have no doubt that something terrible ravaged this land a very long time ago. Middengard is mostly comprised of volcanoes, but none like this. I am surprised there are people still present on Wraeclast after what must have happened...

#### Oshabi
This Oshabi you met... this Lifeforce she spoke of... it confirms something I have come to suspect. The plants here do not grow as they should. I do not mean the bounty we have discovered. What we grow is not the same as it would be back home. It is not the same between harvests, nor even between individual plants. The differences are small, but ever-present. Wraeclast is a land of change. Given that we farmers specialise in long-term predictability, I am very concerned for the future. There is also the question... we, too, grow and change. Will {our} children be subject to the same vicissitudes?
