## Scion - PoE1 Dialogue
#### Scion45
Though we were worlds apart before, exile has brought us together. Back in Oriath, there were those that referred to me as the wonder child, but as you've likely discovered, titles mean little here. Wonder, Exile, monster, hero... it's not the name that defines you. It's what you do that makes you what you are in Wraeclast. Thank you. You have given me what matters most: the freedom to finish what I started.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion45.ogg]]

#### Scion1
Why not just execute us and be done with it, Dominus?
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion1.ogg]]

#### Scion2
So it's true... dead men walk in Wraeclast.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion2.ogg]]

#### Scion3
I'll not be joining you today, dead man.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion3.ogg]]

#### Scion4
I've a simple choice ahead of me. Kill... or be eaten.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion4.ogg]]

#### Scion5
From Oriath to Axiom, one prison to another.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion5.ogg]]

#### Scion6
You remind me of my ex-husband.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion6.ogg]]

#### Scion7
The wall between life and death is crumbling.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion7.ogg]]

#### Scion8
Shore leave is over, captain.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion8.ogg]]

#### Scion9
Why must men turn us into monsters?
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion9.ogg]]

#### Scion10
Savagery thrives all around me.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion10.ogg]]

#### Scion11
The men here should have listened to their hearts. Their minds were not their own.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion11.ogg]]

#### Scion12
Someone had to put an end to this cruel experiment.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion12.ogg]]

#### Scion13
After what this land's become, your kind still manages to make it worse.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion13.ogg]]

#### Scion14
Women like you give the rest of us a bad name.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion14.ogg]]

#### Scion15
There's your 'peace', Oak. The only peace that anyone can expect in Wraeclast.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion15.ogg]]

#### Scion16
Oh my God, no! If there's a way to put this right, I have to find it.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion16.ogg]]

#### Scion17
The least we can do in life is tidy up after ourselves.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion17.ogg]]

#### Scion18
Sarn, where emperors ruled... and died, just like everyone else.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion18.ogg]]

#### Scion19
You are remembered only for the mess you leave behind.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion19.ogg]]

#### Scion20
If left to its own devices, all of Wraeclast would come to be this way.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion20.ogg]]

#### Scion21
It seems that even Time loses its will in Wraeclast.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion21.ogg]]

#### Scion22
Men like you shall not inherit Wraeclast.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion22.ogg]]

#### Scion23
I know of only one woman capable of such depravity. Piety.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion23.ogg]]

#### Scion24
You should die a thousand times over for what you've done.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion24.ogg]]

#### Scion25
This tower says it all. Pride killed the Eternal Empire.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion25.ogg]]

#### Scion26
I prefer the view from where I'm standing now, Dominus.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion26.ogg]]

#### Scion27
I've killed the puppet. Now I just need to follow the strings to his master.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion27.ogg]]

#### Scion28
The Empire didn't need a cataclysm. It created its own desolation.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion28.ogg]]

#### Scion29
Sin is the crack through which Nightmare seeps. What was your Sin, Voll? Pride?
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion29.ogg]]

#### Scion30
The Beast knows that I'm here.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion30.ogg]]

#### Scion31
Yes, Beast, you have every reason to be afraid.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion31.ogg]]

#### Scion32
You will be the first of many to throw off Nightmare's shackles, Deshret.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion32.ogg]]

#### Scion33
As your terror grows, Beast, so does my resolve.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion33.ogg]]

#### Scion34
You have my pity, slave.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion34.ogg]]

#### Scion35
Love was the blade that you turned upon yourself, Sword King.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion35.ogg]]

#### Scion36
I stand within the tortured mind of Kaom himself.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion36.ogg]]

#### Scion37
Save your breath for the Ancestors, Kaom. You'll need it.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion37.ogg]]

#### Scion38
Nightmare, made real.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion38.ogg]]

#### Scion39
This twisting of flesh and life... both brilliant and insane.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion39.ogg]]

#### Scion40
I'm sorry, Maligaro, but I can be quite critical when it comes to Art.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion40.ogg]]

#### Scion41
The world doesn't want your kind of 'beauty', Shavronne.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion41.ogg]]

#### Scion42
This was the only way to satisfy your appetite, Doedre.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion42.ogg]]

#### Scion43
I have the only answer I need, Piety. The Beast dies.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion43.ogg]]

#### Scion44
Poor Malachai. You spent three centuries fighting Death, and in all that time, not once did you take the time to live.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion44.ogg]]

#### Scion46
Can I not have but a moment's respite?
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion46.ogg]]

#### Scion48
I haven't quite the finesse for this.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion48.ogg]]

#### Scion50
Ah... much better.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion50.ogg]]

#### Scion52
I wouldn't know where to start with that.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion52.ogg]]

#### Scion54
Far too much baggage.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion54.ogg]]

#### Scion56
I have nothing more to give.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion56.ogg]]

#### Scion58
I'll be needing that in the near future.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion58.ogg]]

#### Scion60
Your death is a mercy.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion60.ogg]]

#### Scion62
Sleep now, little nightmare.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion62.ogg]]

#### Scion64
And kindly stay dead.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion64.ogg]]

#### Scion66
That felt disturbingly good.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion66.ogg]]

#### Scion68
Your torment is over.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion68.ogg]]

#### Scion70
Neither the time nor the place.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion70.ogg]]

#### Scion72
Too weighty a prospect for me.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion72.ogg]]

#### Scion74
Exile is a lesson and I've always been a fast study.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion74.ogg]]

#### Scion75
Life grows, even in a graveyard.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion75.ogg]]

#### Scion76
I learn, I kill, I live.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion76.ogg]]

#### Scion77
I might just earn my 'wonder child' title yet.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion77.ogg]]

#### Scion78
Power corrupts and corruption empowers.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion78.ogg]]

#### Scion79
There's no resting on your laurels in Wraeclast.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion79.ogg]]

#### Scion80
I have become a walking nightmare.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Scion80.ogg]]

#### ScionEnterAscent
I will save Oriath... or die trying.
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionEnterAscent.ogg]]

#### ScionEnterSlavePens
These are the slave pens? I never knew it was this bad.
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionEnterSlavePens.ogg]]

#### ScionKillKrow
Let this be the end of slavery in Oriath!
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionKillKrow.ogg]]

#### ScionPickUpMiasmeter
You could have been so much more, Piety.
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionPickUpMiasmeter.ogg]]

#### ScionKillCasticus
The Templars should have seen this coming.
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionKillCasticus.ogg]]

#### ScionEnterOriathSquare
I return home with the power to make a difference.
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionEnterOriathSquare.ogg]]

#### ScionEnterTemplarCourts
These corrupt courts should be burned to the ground.
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionEnterTemplarCourts.ogg]]

#### ScionEnterChamberOfInnocence
Such a beautiful house of lies.
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionEnterChamberOfInnocence.ogg]]

#### ScionRespondToAvarius
Who among us is qualified to judge? You?!
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionRespondToAvarius.ogg]]

#### ScionSeenInnocence
God is real?!... good. Someone must be made to answer.
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionSeenInnocence.ogg]]

#### ScionMetSinInnocence
I'm starting to think destroying the Beast was not the best idea...
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionMetSinInnocence.ogg]]

#### ScionEnterTorchedCourts
It seems my wish has been granted!
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionEnterTorchedCourts.ogg]]

#### ScionEnterRuinedSquare
This 'feast' seems more like a funeral pyre. I have to put a stop to this madness!
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionEnterRuinedSquare.ogg]]

#### ScionKillUtula
The Karui deserve freedom, Utula, but you took it too far.
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionKillUtula.ogg]]

#### ScionEnterOssuary
They've been throwing bones in here since before the Eternal Empire. How does anyone keep track?
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionEnterOssuary.ogg]]

#### ScionPickUpSignOfPurity
This feeling... is this Divinity?
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionPickUpSignOfPurity.ogg]]

#### ScionFaceKitava
I won't let you destroy my home!
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionFaceKitava.ogg]]

#### ScionLostToKitava
This isn't over. I will return. I vow to save Oriath.
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionLostToKitava.ogg]]

#### ScionMetSinA6
There is so much more to this world than what I was taught in the Academy.
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionMetSinA6.ogg]]

#### ScionEnterStrandA6
The first moment of true freedom in my entire life was right here on this shore...
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionEnterStrandA6.ogg]]

#### ScionEnterCoastA6
Something's changed. The very air seems alive with strange energies...
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionEnterCoastA6.ogg]]

#### ScionReactsToNessa
I'll do what I can, my friend.
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionReactsToNessa.ogg]]

#### ScionMetSinTukohama
If we must wage war on the gods to save humanity, so be it.
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionMetSinTukohama.ogg]]

#### ScionEnterPrisonA6
Once more into the den of misery.
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionEnterPrisonA6.ogg]]

#### ScionDefeatedShavronne
The world ill needs women like you, Shavronne. Beauty is so much more than skin deep.
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionDefeatedShavronne.ogg]]

#### ScionMetSinAbberath
You might have been their progenitor, foul alchemist, but the goatmen deserve freedom from tyranny just as much as anyone else.
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionMetSinAbberath.ogg]]

#### ScionMetRyslatha
I'm beginning to understand. She was the Azmeri Goddess of Motherhood, but over time, she grew toward the extreme...
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionMetRyslatha.ogg]]

#### ScionNoAzmeri
The Azmeri are gone! What's happened?
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionNoAzmeri.ogg]]

#### ScionReactsToNessaTwo
Something seems off about her...
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionReactsToNessaTwo.ogg]]

#### ScionEnterBrineKingReef
The gods seem to reshape the world around them wherever they go.
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionEnterBrineKingReef.ogg]]

#### ScionMetSinBrineKing
I never had a chance to save you, Nessa. You were already gone.
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionMetSinBrineKing.ogg]]

#### ScionPickUpMaligaroMap
I know this strange sensation. Why is it familiar?
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionPickUpMaligaroMap.ogg]]

#### ScionEnterChamberOfSinsA7
Everywhere I've gone, evil springs forth once more. Have I even made a difference?
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionEnterChamberOfSinsA7.ogg]]

#### ScionEnterMaligarosSanctuary
I'm dreaming while I'm awake. How is this possible?
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionEnterMaligarosSanctuary.ogg]]

#### ScionDefeatedMaligaro
It's time you were part of a dark experiment, Maligaro.
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionDefeatedMaligaro.ogg]]

#### ScionEnterAshenFields
More divine devastation! Wraeclast can never heal so long as the gods trample us underfoot!
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionEnterAshenFields.ogg]]

#### ScionMetSinRalakesh
First Nessa, now Greust. How many more innocents will pay the price?
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionMetSinRalakesh.ogg]]

#### ScionLayGreustToRest
I hope your soul evades the grip of your gods, Greust. I hope you find peace.
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionLayGreustToRest.ogg]]

#### ScionReactToArakaaliShrine
Another parasite on the emotions and faith of mankind.
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionReactToArakaaliShrine.ogg]]

#### ScionMetSinGruthkul
You alone, I forgive, Gruthkul. You're like Sin. You never wanted this, and it cost you everything.
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionMetSinGruthkul.ogg]]

#### ScionReactToYeenaTransforming
How did she do that without a virtue gem?
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionReactToYeenaTransforming.ogg]]

#### ScionEnterTempleOfDecay2
Another twisted domain of the divine. One more ancient tyrant I must depose.
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionEnterTempleOfDecay2.ogg]]

#### ScionReactToArakaali
She's part machine... which means she can be dismantled!
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionReactToArakaali.ogg]]

#### ScionReactToSilkDeath
Silk! No!
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionReactToSilkDeath.ogg]]

#### ScionMetSinArakaali
Silk's death will be the last. I vow it. I will banish every last mad god on this damned continent!
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionMetSinArakaali.ogg]]

#### ScionEnterSarnA8
This place isn't cursed. That's the smell of alchemical byproducts. Somebody's brewing...
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionEnterSarnA8.ogg]]

#### ScionEnterToxicConduits
Doedre is close. I'll follow the flow of chemicals and fumes.
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionEnterToxicConduits.ogg]]

#### ScionDefeatDoedre
I could have used a mind like yours against the tyranny of the gods, Doedre. I'll settle for your soul, though.
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionDefeatDoedre.ogg]]

#### ScionDefeatTolman
I would have given anything to feel a love like that, Clarissa. Treasure what you had.
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionDefeatTolman.ogg]]

#### ScionDefeatGemlings
Centuries in one spot because of a single order... they were little more than machines, in the end.
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionDefeatGemlings.ogg]]

#### ScionMetSinYugul
Yugul! The only god being honest about his rule through fear.
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionMetSinYugul.ogg]]

#### ScionEnterLunarisA8
This place has been transformed by divine madness... but the stench of death remains.
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionEnterLunarisA8.ogg]]

#### ScionPickUpSunOrb
Visions... there lies a secret in the heart of the Sun...
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionPickUpSunOrb.ogg]]

#### ScionPickUpMoonOrb
A vision... the Moon... I never knew...
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionPickUpMoonOrb.ogg]]

#### ScionMetSinSolarisLunaris
Imagine what you two could have accomplished had you worked together. Madness, pure madness.
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionMetSinSolarisLunaris.ogg]]

#### ScionPickUpBasiliskAcid
Now it's my turn to delve into forbidden alchemy, I suppose.
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionPickUpBasiliskAcid.ogg]]

#### ScionMetSinGarukhan
I can only imagine what you have lost, my friend... but she was a god. She had to be put down.
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionMetSinGarukhan.ogg]]

#### ScionMetSinShakari
She wasn't your daughter, my friend. She was nothing more than a dangerous husk... though I imagine it still hurts, just the same.
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionMetSinShakari.ogg]]

#### ScionPickUpTrarthanPowder
Nothing good ever comes from Trarthus. Let's hope this is the exception.
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionPickUpTrarthanPowder.ogg]]

#### ScionEnterBellyA9
If only I had time to study this place, I could advance science a thousand years...
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionEnterBellyA9.ogg]]

#### ScionDefeatUnholyTrio
It is done. Now we have everything we need to face Kitava.
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionDefeatUnholyTrio.ogg]]

#### ScionEnterOriathSquareA10
Oriath... what have they done to you? This nightmare must be put to an end!
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionEnterOriathSquareA10.ogg]]

#### ScionDefeatAvariusA10
Good riddance.
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionDefeatAvariusA10.ogg]]

#### ScionEnterCanals
I won't fail this time!
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionEnterCanals.ogg]]

#### ScionDefeatKitavaA10
Fall, damn you! This world belongs to mortals!
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionDefeatKitavaA10.ogg]]

#### ScionWakeUpKaruiShores
Hard to believe it's been a year already.
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionWakeUpKaruiShores.ogg]]

#### ScionEnterMaps
This place... I'm dreaming while awake, just like in Maligaro's Sanctuary...
![[Scion - PoE1 - ScionEnterMaps.ogg]]

#### Dom_Intro_Scion.ogg
A Scion is perfection in mind, body, and grace. The crowning glory of our civilization, offering us hope, offering us light. But you gave us only murder and darkness. May Wraeclast embrace you as we cannot, for your very presence has become too painful to bear.
![[Scion - PoE1 - Dom_Intro_Scion.ogg.ogg]]
